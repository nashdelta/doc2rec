32376546	The ongoing epidemic of caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 starting in December 2019 poses a serious public health threat globally. The virus is highly infectious and transmitted mainly through droplets and contacts, and is associated with a high risk of pneumonia. A small number of patients may present with acute respiratory distress syndrome with severe respiratory complications, which can lead even to death. The selection of appropriate detection techniques and methods for accurate and rapid identification of pathogens therefore plays a key role in improving the diagnosis and treatment of the patients and containing the outbreak. In this review, the authors gives an overview of the virus laboratory detection technology, including virus isolation and culture, real-time fluorescent PCR, gene sequencing, serological antibody detection, and the gene editing technology based on CRISPR/Cas13 system. These techniques are expected to provide valuable assistance in controlling the epidemic and new ideas for future researches.	F Qiu|H Wang|Z Zhang|L Cao|C Wang|J Wu|Q Du
32353252	The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has highlighted the need for antiviral approaches that can target emerging viruses with no effective vaccines or pharmaceuticals. Here, we demonstrate a CRISPR-Cas13-based strategy, PAC-MAN (prophylactic antiviral CRISPR in human cells), for viral inhibition that can effectively degrade RNA from SARS-CoV-2 sequences and live influenza A virus (IAV) in human lung epithelial cells. We designed and screened CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) targeting conserved viral regions and identified functional crRNAs targeting SARS-CoV-2. This approach effectively reduced H1N1 IAV load in respiratory epithelial cells. Our bioinformatic analysis showed that a group of only six crRNAs can target more than 90% of all coronaviruses. With the development of a safe and effective system for respiratory tract delivery, PAC-MAN has the potential to become an important pan-coronavirus inhibition strategy.

32109355	Aeromonas species are indigenous in diverse aquatic environments and play important roles in environmental remediation. However, the pollutant transformation mechanisms of these bacteria remain elusive, and their potential in pollution control is largely unexploited so far. In this work, we report an efficient and simple genome regulation tool to edit Aeromonas hydrophila and identify its biomolecular pathways for pollutant transformation. The genome regulation system, which is based on the type II clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat interference (CRISPRi) system from Streptococcus pyogenes, can serve as a reversible and multiplexible platform for gene knockdown in A. hydrophila. A single-plasmid CRISPRi system harboring both dCas9 and the sgRNA was constructed in A. hydrophila and used to silence diverse genes with varied sizes and expression levels. With this system, up to 467-fold repression of gfp expression was achieved, and the function of the essential gene-ftsZ was identified quickly and accurately. Furthermore, simultaneous transcriptional repression of multiple targeted genes was realized. We discovered that the ars operon played an essential role in arsenic detoxification, and the extracellular electron transfer (EET) pathway was involved in methyl orange reduction, but not in vanadium reduction by A. hydrophila. Our method allows better insights and effective genetic manipulation of the pollutant transformation processes in Aeromonas, which might facilitate more efficient utilization of the Aeromonas species and other microbial species for environmental remediation applications.

32101421	Carbon competition between cell growth and product synthesis is the bottleneck in efficient N-acetyl glucosamine (GlcNAc) production in microbial cell factories. In this study, a xylose-induced T7 RNA polymerase-PT7 promoter system was introduced in Escherichia coli W3110 to control the GlcNAc synthesis. Meanwhile, an arabinose-induced CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) system was applied to adjust cell growth by attenuating the transcription of key growth-related genes. By designing proper sgRNAs, followed by elaborate adjustment of the addition time and concentration of the two inducers, the carbon flux between cell growth and GlcNAc synthesis was precisely redistributed. Comparative metabolomics analysis results confirmed that the repression of pfkA and zwf significantly attenuated the TCA cycle and the synthesis of related amino acids, saving more carbon for the GlcNAc synthesis. Finally, the simultaneous repression of pfkA and zwf in strain GLA-14 increased the GlcNAc titer by 47.6% compared with that in E. coli without the CRISPRi system in a shake flask. GLA-14 could produce 90.9 g/L GlcNAc within 40 h in a 5 L bioreactor, with a high productivity of 2.27 g/L/h. This dynamic strategy for rebalancing cell growth and product synthesis could be applied in the fermentative production of other chemicals derived from precursors synthesized via central carbon metabolism.

32084183	Proteus spp. are commensal gastrointestinal bacteria in many hosts, but information regarding the mutual relationships between these bacteria and their hosts is limited. The tree shrew is an alternative laboratory animal widely used for human disease research. However, little is known about the relationship between Proteus spp. and tree shrews. In this study, the complete genome sequencing method was used to analyse the characteristics of Proteus spp. isolated from tree shrews, and comparative genomic analysis was performed to reveal their relationships. The results showed that 36 Proteus spp. bacteria were isolated, including 34 Proteus mirabilis strains and two Proteus vulgaris strains. The effective rate of sequencing was 93.53%±2.73%, with an average GC content of 39.94%±0.25%. Briefly, 3682.89±90.37, 2771.36±36.01 and 2832.06±42.49 genes were annotated in the NCBI non-redundant nucleotide database (NR), SwissProt database and KEGG database, respectively. The high proportions of macrolide-, vancomycin-, bacitracin-, and tetracycline-resistance profiles of the strains were annotated in the Antibiotic Resistance Genes Database (ARDB). Flagella, lipooligosaccharides, type 1 fimbriae and P fimbriae were the most abundantly annotated virulence factors in the Virulence Factor Database (VFDB). SNP variants indicated high proportions of base transitions (Ts), homozygous mutations (Hom) and non-synonymous mutations (Non-Syn) in Proteus spp. (P<0.05). Phylogenetic analysis of Proteus spp. and other references revealed high genetic diversity for strains isolated from tree shrews, and host specificity of Proteus spp. bacteria was not found. Overall, this study provided important information on characteristics of genome for Proteus spp. isolated from tree shrews.	W Gu|W Wang|P Tong|C Liu|J Jia|C Lu|Y Han|X Sun|D Kuang|N Li|J Dai
32080622	Ferroptosis is widely involved in degenerative diseases in various tissues including kidney, liver and brain, and is a targetable vulnerability in multiple primary and therapy-resistant cancers. Accumulation of phospholipid hydroperoxides in cellular membranes is the hallmark and rate-limiting step of ferroptosis; however, the enzymes contributing to lipid peroxidation remain poorly characterized. Using genome-wide, CRISPR-Cas9-mediated suppressor screens, we identify cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (POR) as necessary for ferroptotic cell death in cancer cells exhibiting inherent and induced susceptibility to ferroptosis. By genetic depletion of POR in cancer cells, we reveal that POR contributes to ferroptosis across a wide range of lineages and cell states, and in response to distinct mechanisms of ferroptosis induction. Using systematic lipidomic profiling, we further map POR's activity to the lipid peroxidation step in ferroptosis. Hence, our work suggests that POR is a key mediator of ferroptosis and potential druggable target for developing antiferroptosis therapeutics.

32080184	Recently, both 5p and 3p miRNA strands are being recognized as functional instead of only one, leaving many miRNA strands uninvestigated. To determine whether both miRNA strands, which have different mRNA-targeting sequences, cooperate to regulate pathways/functions across cancer types, we evaluate genomic, epigenetic, and molecular profiles of >5200 patient samples from 14 different cancers, and RNA interference and CRISPR screens in 290 cancer cell lines. We identify concordantly dysregulated miRNA 5p/3p pairs that coordinately modulate oncogenic pathways and/or cell survival/growth across cancers. Down-regulation of both strands of miR-30a and miR-145 recurrently increased cell cycle pathway genes and significantly reduced patient survival in multiple cancers. Forced expression of all four strands show cooperativity, reducing cell cycle pathways and inhibiting lung cancer cell proliferation and migration. Therefore, we identify miRNA whose 5p/3p strands function together to regulate core tumorigenic processes/pathways and reveal a previously unknown pan-cancer miRNA signature with patient prognostic power.

32076262	CRISPR-Cas immunity protects prokaryotes against invading genetic elements1. It uses the highly conserved Cas1-Cas2 complex to establish inheritable memory (spacers)2-5. How Cas1-Cas2 acquires spacers from foreign DNA fragments (prespacers) and integrates them into the CRISPR locus in the correct orientation is unclear6,7. Here, using the high spatiotemporal resolution of single-molecule fluorescence, we show that Cas1-Cas2 selects precursors of prespacers from DNA in various forms-including single-stranded DNA and partial duplexes-in a manner that depends on both the length of the DNA strand and the presence of a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence. We also identify DnaQ exonucleases as enzymes that process the Cas1-Cas2-loaded prespacer precursors into mature prespacers of a suitable size for integration. Cas1-Cas2 protects the PAM sequence from maturation, which results in the production of asymmetrically trimmed prespacers and the subsequent integration of spacers in the correct orientation. Our results demonstrate the kinetic coordination of prespacer precursor selection and PAM trimming, providing insight into the mechanisms that underlie the integration of functional spacers in the CRISPR loci.

32072789	In recent years, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated base editing has been developed to a powerful genome editing tool, providing advantages such as without introducing double-stranded DNA break, a donor template and relying on host homologous recombination repair pathway, and has been widely applied in animals, plants, yeast and bacteria. In previous study, our group developed a multiplex automated base editing method (MACBETH) in the important industrial model strain Corynebacterium glutamicum. In this study, to further optimize the method and improve the base editing efficiency in C. glutamicum, we first constructed a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter-based detection system. The point mutation in the inactivated GFP protein can be edited to restore the GFP fluorescence. By combining with flow cytometry analysis, the base-editing efficiency can be quickly calculated. Then, the base editor with the target gRNA was constructed, and the editing efficiency with the initial editing condition was (13.11±0.21)%. Based on this result, the editing conditions were optimized and the result indicated that the best medium is CGXII, the best initial OD₆₀₀ of induction is 0.05, the best induction time is 20 h, and the best IPTG concentration is 0.01 mmol/L. After optimization, the editing efficiency was improved to (30.35±0.75)%, which was 1.3-fold of that in initial condition. Finally, endogenous genomic loci of C. glutamicum were selected to assess if the optimized condition can improve genome editing in other loci. Editing efficiency of different loci in optimized condition were improved to 1.7-2.5 fold of that in original condition, indicating the effectiveness and versatility of the optimized condition. Our research will promote the better application of base editing technology in C. glutamicum.	近年来，基于CRISPR/Cas9 的碱基编辑技术因其具有不产生DNA 双链断裂、无需外源DNA 模板、不依赖宿主同源重组修复的优势，已经逐渐发展成为一种强大的基因组编辑工具，在动物、植物、酵母和细菌中得到了开发和应用。研究团队前期已在重要的工业模式菌株谷氨酸棒杆菌中开发了一种多元自动化的碱基编辑技术MACBETH，为进一步优化该方法，提高碱基编辑技术在谷氨酸棒杆菌中的应用效率，本研究首先在谷氨酸棒杆菌中构建了基于绿色荧光蛋白 (GFP) 的检测系统：将GFP 基因的起始密码子ATG 人工突变为ACG，GFP 无法正常表达，当该密码子的C 经编辑后恢复为T，即实现GFP 蛋白的复活，结合流式细胞仪分析技术，可快速衡量编辑效率。然后，构建针对靶标位点的碱基编辑工具，经测试，该位点可成功被编辑，在初始编辑条件下碱基编辑效率为 (13.11±0.21)%。在此基础上，通过对不同培养基类型、诱导初始OD₆₀₀、诱导时间、诱导物浓度进行优化，确定最优编辑条件是：培养基为CGXII，初始OD₆₀₀ 为0.05，诱导时间为20 h，IPTG 浓度为0.01 mmol/L。经过优化，编辑效率达到 (30.35±0.75)%，较初始条件提高了1.3 倍。最后，选取原编辑条件下编辑效率较低的位点，进行了优化后编辑条件下的编辑效率评估，结果显示，不同的位点在最优编辑条件下的编辑效率提高了1.7–2.5 倍，进一步证实该优化条件的有效性及通用性。研究结果为碱基编辑技术在谷氨酸棒杆菌中更好的应用提供了重要的参考价值。.

32062962	Pursuing efficient approaches to promote the extracellular electron transfer (EET) of extracellular respiratory bacteria is essential to their application in environmental remediation and waste treatment. Here, we report a new strategy of tuning electron flux by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-ddAsCpf1-based rediverting (namely STAR) to enhance the EET capacity of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, a model extracellular respiratory bacterium widely present in the environment. The developed CRISPR-ddAsCpf1 system enabled approximately 100% gene repression with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a reporter. Using a WO3 probe, 10 representative genes encoding for putative competitive electron transfer proteins were screened, among which 7 genes were identified as valid targets for EET enhancement. Repressing the valid genes not only increased the transcription level of the l-lactate metabolism genes but also affected the genes involved in direct and indirect EET. Increased riboflavin production was also observed. The feasibility of this strategy to enhance the bioreduction of methyl orange, an organic pollutant, and chromium, a typical heavy metal, was demonstrated. This work implies a great potential of the STAR strategy with the CIRPSR-ddAsCpf1 system for enhancing bacterial EET to favor more efficient environmental remediation applications.

32013418	Lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT), one of the oligosaccharides in human milk, has many beneficial effects on infant health. In a recent work, we have constructed a recombinant Bacillus subtilis strain for the production of LNnT. Here, we further improved LNnT production with a xylose-induced clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats interference system. In particular, the expressions of pfkA and pyk genes in the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway module, zwf gene in the pentose phosphate pathway module, and mnaA gene in the teichoic acid synthesis module were downregulated. The LNnT titer was increased from 1.32 to 1.55 g/L. Furthermore, to improve the conversion efficiency of lacto-N-triose II to LNnT, we knocked out tuaD gene in branch pathway and improved the expression of lgtB gene, resulting in the further increase of LNnT titer to 2.01 g/L. Finally, the addition time and amount of inducer xylose were optimized, and LNnT titer reached 2.30 g/L in shake flask and 5.41 g/L in 3 L bioreactor.

32010936	Prokaryotic adaptive immunity is built when short DNA fragments called spacers are acquired into CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) arrays. CRISPR adaptation is a multistep process which comprises selection, generation, and incorporation of prespacers into arrays. Once adapted, spacers provide immunity through the recognition of complementary nucleic acid sequences, channeling them for destruction. To prevent deleterious autoimmunity, CRISPR adaptation must therefore be a highly regulated and infrequent process, at least in the absence of genetic invaders. Over the years, ingenious methods to study CRISPR adaptation have been developed. In this paper, we discuss and compare methods that detect CRISPR adaptation and its intermediates in vivo and propose suppressing PCR as a simple modification of a popular assay to monitor spacer acquisition with increased sensitivity.

32004468	Two decades into the twenty-first century, a confluence of breakthrough technologies wielded at the molecular level is presenting biologists with unique opportunities to unravel the complexities of the cellular world. CRISPR/Cas9 allows gene knock-outs, knock-ins, and single-base editing at chromosomal loci. RNA-based tools such as siRNA, antisense oligos, and morpholinos can be used to silence expression of specific genes. Meanwhile, protein knockdown tools that draw inspiration from natural regulatory mechanisms and facilitate elimination of native or degron-tagged proteins from cells are rapidly emerging. The acute and reversible reduction in protein levels enabled by these methods allows for precise determination of loss-of-function phenotypes free from secondary effects or compensatory adaptation that can confound nucleic-acid-based methods that involve slow depletion or permanent loss of a protein. In this Review, we summarize the ingenious ways biologists have exploited natural mechanisms for protein degradation to direct the elimination of specific proteins at will. This has led to advancements not only in basic research but also in the therapeutic space with the introduction of PROTACs into clinical trials for cancer patients.	R Verma|D Mohl|RJ Deshaies
31988385	The human gene catalogue is essentially complete, but we lack an equivalently vetted inventory of bona fide human enhancers. Hundreds of thousands of candidate enhancers have been nominated via biochemical annotations; however, only a handful of these have been validated and confidently linked to their target genes. Here we review emerging technologies for discovering, characterizing and validating human enhancers at scale. We furthermore propose a new framework for operationally defining enhancers that accommodates the heterogeneous and complementary results that are emerging from reporter assays, biochemical measurements and CRISPR screens.

31980818	In type I CRISPR-Cas system, Cas3-a nuclease cum helicase-in cooperation with Cascade surveillance complex cleaves the target DNA. Unlike the Cascade/I-E, which is composed of five subunits, the Cascade/I-C is made of only three subunits lacking the CRISPR RNA processing enzyme Cas6, whose role is assumed by Cas5. How these differences in the composition and organization of Cascade subunits in type I-C influence the Cas3/I-C binding and its target cleavage mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we show that Cas3/I-C is intrinsically a single-strand specific promiscuous nuclease. Apart from the helicase domain, a constellation of highly conserved residues-which are unique to type I-C-located in the uncharacterized C-terminal domain appears to influence the nuclease activity. Recruited by Cascade/I-C, the HD nuclease of Cas3/I-C nicks the single-stranded region of the non-target strand and positions the helicase motor. Powered by ATP, the helicase motor reels in the target DNA, until it encounters the roadblock en route, which stimulates the HD nuclease. Remarkably, we show that Cas3/I-C supplants Cas3/I-E for CRISPR interference in type I-E in vivo, suggesting that the target cleavage mechanism is evolutionarily conserved between type I-C and type I-E despite the architectural difference exhibited by Cascade/I-C and Cascade/I-E.

31980625	The CRISPR system provides adaptive immunity against mobile genetic elements in prokaryotes. On binding invading RNA species, Type III CRISPR systems generate cyclic oligoadenylate (cOA) signalling molecules, potentiating a powerful immune response by activating downstream effector proteins, leading to viral clearance, cell dormancy or death. Here we describe the structure and mechanism of a cOA-activated CRISPR defence DNA endonuclease, CRISPR ancillary nuclease 1 (Can1). Can1 has a unique monomeric structure with two CRISPR associated Rossman fold (CARF) domains and two DNA nuclease-like domains. The crystal structure of the enzyme has been captured in the activated state, with a cyclic tetra-adenylate (cA4) molecule bound at the core of the protein. cA4 binding reorganises the structure to license a metal-dependent DNA nuclease activity specific for nicking of supercoiled DNA. DNA nicking by Can1 is predicted to slow down viral replication kinetics by leading to the collapse of DNA replication forks.	SA McMahon|W Zhu|S Graham|R Rambo|MF White|TM Gloster
31980609	Tissue-specific gene expression requires coordinated control of gene-proximal and -distal cis-regulatory elements (CREs), yet functional analysis of gene-distal CREs such as enhancers remains challenging. Here we describe CRISPR/dCas9-based enhancer-targeting epigenetic editing systems, enCRISPRa and enCRISPRi, for efficient analysis of enhancer function in situ and in vivo. Using dual effectors capable of re-writing enhancer-associated chromatin modifications, we show that enCRISPRa and enCRISPRi modulate gene transcription by remodeling local epigenetic landscapes at sgRNA-targeted enhancers and associated genes. Comparing with existing methods, the improved systems display more robust perturbations of enhancer activity and gene transcription with minimal off-targets. Allele-specific targeting of enCRISPRa to oncogenic TAL1 super-enhancer modulates TAL1 expression and cancer progression in xenotransplants. Single or multi-loci perturbations of lineage-specific enhancers using an enCRISPRi knock-in mouse establish in vivo evidence for lineage-restricted essentiality of developmental enhancers during hematopoiesis. Hence, enhancer-targeting CRISPR epigenetic editing provides opportunities for interrogating enhancer function in native biological contexts.

31925399	It is difficult to elucidate the transcriptional history of a cell using current experimental approaches, as they are destructive in nature and therefore describe only a moment in time. To overcome these limitations, we recently established Record-seq, a technology that enables transcriptional recording by CRISPR spacer acquisition from RNA. The recorded transcriptomes are recovered by SENECA, a method that selectively amplifies expanded CRISPR arrays, followed by deep sequencing. The resulting CRISPR spacers are aligned to the host genome, thereby enabling transcript quantification and associated analyses. Here, we describe the experimental procedures of the Record-seq workflow as well as subsequent data analysis. Beginning with the experimental design, Record-seq data can be obtained and analyzed within 1-2 weeks.	T Tanna|F Schmidt|MY Cherepkova|M Okoniewski|RJ Platt
31922192	CRISPR-Cas constitutes the adaptive immune system of bacteria and archaea. This RNA-mediated sequence-specific recognition and targeting machinery has been used broadly for diverse applications in a wide range of organisms across the tree of life. The compact class 2 systems, that hinge on a single Cas effector nuclease have been harnessed for genome editing, transcriptional regulation, detection, imaging and other applications, in different research areas. However, most of the CRISPR-Cas systems belong to class 1, and the molecular machinery of the most widespread and diverse Type I systems afford tremendous opportunities for a broad range of applications. These highly abundant systems rely on a multi-protein effector complex, the CRISPR associated complex for antiviral defense (Cascade), which drives DNA targeting and cleavage. The complexity of these systems has somewhat hindered their widespread usage, but the pool of thousands of diverse Type I CRISPR-Cas systems opens new avenues for CRISPR-based applications in bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. Here, we describe the features and mechanism of action of Type I CRISPR-Cas systems, illustrate how endogenous systems can be reprogrammed to target the host genome and perform genome editing and transcriptional regulation by co-delivering a minimal CRISPR array together with a repair template. Moreover, we discuss how these systems can also be used in eukaryotes. This review provides a framework for expanding the CRISPR toolbox, and repurposing the most abundant CRISPR-Cas systems for a wide range of applications.	C Hidalgo-Cantabrana|R Barrangou
31919360	Host dependency factors that are required for influenza A virus infection may serve as therapeutic targets as the virus is less likely to bypass them under drug-mediated selection pressure. Previous attempts to identify host factors have produced largely divergent results, with few overlapping hits across different studies. Here, we perform a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen and devise a new approach, meta-analysis by information content (MAIC) to systematically combine our results with prior evidence for influenza host factors. MAIC out-performs other meta-analysis methods when using our CRISPR screen as validation data. We validate the host factors, WDR7, CCDC115 and TMEM199, demonstrating that these genes are essential for viral entry and regulation of V-type ATPase assembly. We also find that CMTR1, a human mRNA cap methyltransferase, is required for efficient viral cap snatching and regulation of a cell autonomous immune response, and provides synergistic protection with the influenza endonuclease inhibitor Xofluza.

31913353	Using genome-wide clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) screens to understand endocrine drug resistance, we discovered ARID1A and other SWI/SNF complex components as the factors most critically required for response to two classes of estrogen receptor-alpha (ER) antagonists. In this context, SWI/SNF-specific gene deletion resulted in drug resistance. Unexpectedly, ARID1A was also the top candidate in regard to response to the bromodomain and extraterminal domain inhibitor JQ1, but in the opposite direction, with loss of ARID1A sensitizing breast cancer cells to bromodomain and extraterminal domain inhibition. We show that ARID1A is a repressor that binds chromatin at ER cis-regulatory elements. However, ARID1A elicits repressive activity in an enhancer-specific, but forkhead box A1-dependent and active, ER-independent manner. Deletion of ARID1A resulted in loss of histone deacetylase 1 binding, increased histone 4 lysine acetylation and subsequent BRD4-driven transcription and growth. ARID1A mutations are more frequent in treatment-resistant disease, and our findings provide mechanistic insight into this process while revealing rational treatment strategies for these patients.

31907455	The RecBCD complex plays key roles in phage DNA degradation, CRISPR array acquisition (adaptation) and host DNA repair. The switch between these roles is regulated by a DNA sequence called Chi. We report cryo-EM structures of the Escherichia coli RecBCD complex bound to several different DNA forks containing a Chi sequence, including one in which Chi is recognized and others in which it is not. The Chi-recognized structure shows conformational changes in regions of the protein that contact Chi and reveals a tortuous path taken by the DNA. Sequence specificity arises from interactions with both the RecC subunit and the sequence itself. These structures provide molecular details for how Chi is recognized and insights into the changes that occur in response to Chi binding that switch RecBCD from bacteriophage destruction and CRISPR spacer acquisition to constructive host DNA repair.

31907146	The CRISPR/Cas9 system, consisting of Cas9 nuclease and single guide RNA (sgRNA), is an emerging gene editing technology that can perform gene reprogramming operations such as deletion, insertion, and point mutation on DNA sequences targeted by sgRNA. In addition, CRISPR/dCas9 (a mutant that loses Cas9 nuclease activity) still retains the ability of sgRNA to target DNA. The fusion of dCas9 protein with transcriptional activator (CRISPRa) can activate the expression of the target gene, and fusion transcriptional repressors (CRISPRi) can also be used to suppress target gene expression. Efficient delivery of the CRISPR/Cas9 system is one of the main problems limiting its wide clinical application. Viral vectors are widely used to efficiently deliver CRISPR/Cas9 elements, but non-viral vector research is more attractive in terms of safety, simplicity, and flexibility. In this review, we summarize the principles and research advances of CRISPR technology, including CRISPR/ Cas9 delivery vectors, delivery methods, and obstacles to the delivery, and review the progress of CRISPR-based research in bone and cartilage tissue engineering. Finally, the challenges and future applications of CRISPR technology in bone and cartilage tissue engineering are discussed.	G Chen|D Cheng|B Chen
31898252	Genome-scale engineering is a crucial methodology to rationally regulate microbiological system operations, leading to expected biological behaviors or enhanced bioproduct yields. Over the past decade, innovative genome modification technologies have been developed for effectively regulating and manipulating genes at the genome level. Here, we discuss the current genome-scale engineering technologies used for microbial engineering. Recently developed strategies, such as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9, multiplex automated genome engineering (MAGE), promoter engineering, CRISPR-based regulations, and synthetic small regulatory RNA (sRNA)-based knockdown, are considered as powerful tools for genome-scale engineering in microbiological systems. MAGE, which modifies specific nucleotides of the genome sequence, is utilized as a genome-editing tool. Contrastingly, synthetic sRNA, CRISPRi, and CRISPRa are mainly used to regulate gene expression without modifying the genome sequence.

31879772	CRISPR-Cas systems provide prokaryotes with adaptive immune functions against viruses and other genetic parasites. In contrast to all other types of CRISPR-Cas systems, type IV has remained largely overlooked. Here, we describe a previously uncharted diversity of type IV gene cassettes, primarily encoded by plasmid-like elements from diverse prokaryotic taxa. Remarkably, via a comprehensive analysis of their CRISPR spacer content, these systems were found to exhibit a strong bias towards the targeting of other plasmids. Our data indicate that the functions of type IV systems have diverged from those of other host-related CRISPR-Cas immune systems to adopt a role in mediating conflicts between plasmids. Furthermore, we find evidence for cross-talk between certain type IV and type I CRISPR-Cas systems that co-exist intracellularly, thus providing a simple answer to the enigmatic absence of type IV adaptation modules. Collectively, our results lead to the expansion and reclassification of type IV systems and provide novel insights into the biological function and evolution of these elusive systems.

31874627	CRISPR-based systems are playing an important role in modern genome engineering. A large number of computational methods have been developed to assist in the identification of suitable guides. However, there is only limited overlap between the guides that each tool identifies. This can motivate further development, but also raises the question of whether it is possible to combine existing tools to improve guide design.	We considered nine leading guide design tools, and their output when tested using two sets of guides for which experimental validation data is available. We found that consensus approaches were able to outperform individual tools. The best performance (with a precision of up to 0.912) was obtained when combining four of the tools and accepting all guides selected by at least three of them.	These results can be used to improve CRISPR-based studies, but also to guide further tool development. However, they only provide a short-term solution as the time and computational resources required to run four tools may be impractical in certain applications.	J Bradford|D Perrin
31874326	Lactobacillus (L.) sanfranciscensis is a competitive key species in sourdough fermentations. However, the principles involved in establishing the commonly observed phenomenon of strain dominance are unresolved. This has been studied little because the methods for fast and reliable differentiation of strains and their monitoring during fermentation are tedious and cannot be done with large numbers of isolates. In this contribution, we present a strain-specific, PCR-based typing method that uses length heterogeneities of the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) loci as they occur in the genomes of different strains. In silico analysis of 21 genomes revealed 14 different CRISPR genotypes. We then designed a primer set to simultaneously detect different strains in a multiplex PCR assay designated CRISPR locus length polymorphism PCR (CLLP-PCR). The usefulness of this method was evaluated in lab-scale sourdough fermentations conducted with rye and wheat flours. First, the flour was mixed with water to a dough yield of 200. Then each dough was inoculated with four different L. sanfranciscensis strains (TMW 1.1150, TMW 1.392, TMW 1.2142, and TMW 1.2138) at levels of 109 cfu/g each. Sourdoughs were propagated at 28 °C for 5 days by back slopping 5% to the flour mass every 24 h. Samples were collected each day; DNA was isolated, and the presence of strains was detected qualitatively in the sourdoughs with PCR. L. sanfranciscensis TMW 1.392 became dominant as early as 2 days into the fermentation and remained the only detectable strain for the rest of the sampling period. CLLP-PCR proved to be useful in investigating the assertiveness of different strains of L. sanfranciscensis in sourdoughs. Therefore, CLLP-PCR may be used as a tool to investigate assertiveness of microorganisms in food fermentations at the strain level.	E Rogalski|RF Vogel|MA Ehrmann
31873222	Here, we report a rapid CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene knock-in strategy that uses Cas9 ribonucleoprotein and 5'-modified double-stranded DNA donors with 50-base-pair homology arms and achieved unprecedented 65/40% knock-in rates for 0.7/2.5 kilobase inserts, respectively, in human embryonic kidney 293T cells. The identified 5'-end modification led to up to a fivefold increase in gene knock-in rates at various genomic loci in human cancer and stem cells.

31872209	Discovered as an adaptive immune system of prokaryotes, CRISPR-Cas provides many promising applications. DNA-cleaving Cas enzymes like Cas9 and Cas12a, are of great interest for genome editing. The specificity of these DNA nucleases is determined by RNA guides, providing great targeting adaptability. Besides this general method of programmable DNA cleavage, these nucleases have different biochemical characteristics, that can be exploited for different applications. Although Cas nucleases are highly promising, some room for improvement remains. New developments and discoveries like base editing, prime editing, and CRISPR-associated transposons might address some of these challenges.	T Swartjes|RHJ Staals|J van der Oost
31859589	CRISPR-based typing was performed to subtype isolates of S. Typhimurium and its monophasic variant Salmonella 4,[5],12:i:- from humans and animals between 2009 and 2017 in China. CRISPR typing classified all isolates into two lineages and four sub-lineages. All isolates from Lineage II and Lineage IB-1 were Salmonella Typhimurium. All of Salmonella 4,[5],12:i: - isolates were distributed in Lineage IA and Lineage IB-2, which all belonged to ST34 by MLST typing. Only Lineage IB-2 contained ST34 isolates from both Salmonella Typhimurium and Salmonella 4,[5],12:i:-. Among the isolates of ST34, TST4 was identified as the most common CRISPR type representing 86.5% of Salmonella 4,[5],12:i:- and 14.5 % of Salmonella Typhimurium mainly from pigs and humans. This study demonstrated that TST4-ST34 isolates were predominant in Salmonella 4,[5],12:i:-, and pig was the main reservoir for Salmonella 4,[5],12:i:- in China, which might have the potential to transmit to humans by pig production.

31859038	Functional genomics is at the core of studying the exact function of genes. However, homozygous knockouts of essential and pleiotropic effectors (almost 10% of the genome) are not always possible, thus, functions of these genes remain obscured. The tissue-specific genome editing tool (CRISPR-TSKO) recently described by Decaestecker et al., can characterize these indispensable genes and has wide applications in plants.

Until recently, this focus has been challenged by a lack of efficacious, high throughput, and low-cost gene editing modalities and screening methods. In this work, we demonstrate an improved method for gene editing in CHO cells using CRISPR RNPs and characterize the endpoints of Cas9 and ZFN mediated genetic engineering. Furthermore, we validate sequence decomposition as a cost effective, rapid, and accurate method for assessing mutants and eliminating non-clonal CHO populations using only capillary sequencing.

31853874	Curcuminoids are natural phenylpropanoids that are biosynthesized via an L-phenylalanine metabolism pathway in turmeric (Curcuma longa L.). Curcuminoids have various chemopreventive activities and pharmaceutical applications in human life. In this study, we synthesized dicinnamoylmethane, one principal component of curcuminoids, from cinnamic acid by means of co-expression of Oryza sativa curcuminoid synthase and Petroselinum crispum 4-coumarate-CoA ligase in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). Moreover, we used CRISPRi systems to knock down the genes in a tricarboxylic acid cycle and fatty acid biosynthesis pathway. The repression of target genes led to an increase of up to 0.236 μmol g-1 DCW of malonyl-CoA in cytosol-engineered E. coli and subsequently increased the biosynthesis of dicinnamoylmethane. We found that the S10 strain containing a CRISPRi repression for three genes, fabF, fabD, and mdh, showed the highest amount of dicinnamoylmethane of 7.54 μM, which is 5.76-fold higher than that of the wild-type strain. Finally, 41.94 μM (~ 11.6 mg) of dicinnamoylmethane was obtained in a 3-L fermenter.	LL Chu|RP Pandey|D Dhakal|JK Sohng

31818361	The mitochondrial genome encodes 13 proteins that are components of the oxidative phosphorylation system (OXPHOS), suggesting that precise regulation of these genes is crucial for maintaining OXPHOS functions, including ATP production, calcium buffering, cell signaling, ROS production, and apoptosis. Furthermore, heteroplasmy or mis-regulation of gene expression in mitochondria frequently is associated with human mitochondrial diseases. Thus, various approaches have been developed to investigate the roles of genes encoded by the mitochondrial genome. In this review, we will discuss a wide range of techniques available for investigating the mitochondrial genome, mitochondrial transcription, and mitochondrial translation, which provide a useful guide to understanding mitochondrial gene expression.

31811138	Although single-component Class 2 CRISPR systems, such as type II Cas9 or type V Cas12a (Cpf1), are widely used for genome editing in eukaryotic cells, the application of multi-component Class 1 CRISPR has been less developed. Here we demonstrate that type I-E CRISPR mediates distinct DNA cleavage activity in human cells. Notably, Cas3, which possesses helicase and nuclease activity, predominantly triggered several thousand base pair deletions upstream of the 5'-ARG protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), without prominent off-target activity. This Cas3-mediated directional and broad DNA degradation can be used to introduce functional gene knockouts and knock-ins. As an example of potential therapeutic applications, we show Cas3-mediated exon-skipping of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) gene in patient-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). These findings broaden our understanding of the Class 1 CRISPR system, which may serve as a unique genome editing tool in eukaryotic cells distinct from the Class 2 CRISPR system.

31801211	The gene editing tool CRISPR-Cas has become the foundation for developing numerous molecular systems used in research and, increasingly, in medical practice. In particular, Cas proteins devoid of nucleolytic activity (dead Cas proteins; dCas) can be used to deliver functional cargo to programmed sites in the genome. In this review, we describe current CRISPR systems used for developing different dCas-based molecular approaches and summarize their most significant applications. We conclude with comments on the state-of-art in the CRISPR field and future directions.	S Brezgin|A Kostyusheva|D Kostyushev|V Chulanov
31799627	Dynamic regulation is an effective strategy for fine-tuning metabolic pathways in order to maximize target product synthesis. However, achieving dynamic and autonomous up- and down-regulation of the metabolic modules of interest simultaneously, still remains a great challenge. In this work, we created an autonomous dual-control (ADC) system, by combining CRISPRi-based NOT gates with novel biosensors of a key metabolite in the pathway of interest. By sensing the levels of the intermediate glucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcN6P) and self-adjusting the expression levels of the target genes accordingly with the GlcN6P biosensor and ADC system enabled feedback circuits, the metabolic flux towards the production of the high value nutraceutical N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) could be balanced and optimized in Bacillus subtilis. As a result, the GlcNAc titer in a 15-l fed-batch bioreactor increased from 59.9 g/l to 97.1 g/l with acetoin production and 81.7 g/l to 131.6 g/l without acetoin production, indicating the robustness and stability of the synthetic circuits in a large bioreactor system. Remarkably, this self-regulatory methodology does not require any external level of control such as the use of inducer molecules or switching fermentation/environmental conditions. Moreover, the proposed programmable genetic circuits may be expanded to engineer other microbial cells and metabolic pathways.	Y Wu|T Chen|Y Liu|R Tian|X Lv|J Li|G Du|J Chen|R Ledesma-Amaro|L Liu

31792210	Gemcitabine is the first-line treatment for locally advanced and metastatic gallbladder cancer (GBC), but poor gemcitabine response is universal. Here, we utilize a genome-wide CRISPR screen to identify that loss of ELP5 reduces the gemcitabine-induced apoptosis in GBC cells in a P53-dependent manner through the Elongator complex and other uridine 34 (U34) tRNA-modifying enzymes. Mechanistically, loss of ELP5 impairs the integrity and stability of the Elongator complex to abrogate wobble U34 tRNA modification, and directly impedes the wobble U34 modification-dependent translation of hnRNPQ mRNA, a validated P53 internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) trans-acting factor. Downregulated hnRNPQ is unable to drive P53 IRES-dependent translation, but rescuing a U34 modification-independent hnRNPQ mutant could restore P53 translation and gemcitabine sensitivity in ELP5-depleted GBC cells. GBC patients with lower ELP5, hnRNPQ, or P53 expression have poor survival outcomes after gemcitabine chemotherapy. These results indicate that the Elongator/hnRNPQ/P53 axis controls gemcitabine sensitivity in GBC cells.	S Xu|M Zhan|C Jiang|M He|L Yang|H Shen|S Huang|X Huang|R Lin|Y Shi|Q Liu|W Chen|M Mohan|J Wang
31791238	Xanthomonads are an important clade of Gram-negative bacteria infecting a plethora of economically important host plants, including citrus. Knowledge about the pathogen's diversity and population structure are prerequisite for epidemiological surveillance and efficient disease management. Rapidly evolving genetic loci, such as Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR), are of special interest to develop new molecular typing tools.	We analyzed CRISPR loci of 56 Xanthomonas citri pv. citri strains of world-wide origin, a regulated pathogen causing Asiatic citrus canker in several regions of the world. With one exception, 23 unique sequences built up the repertoire of spacers, suggesting that this set of strains originated from a common ancestor that already harbored these 23 spacers. One isolate originating from Pakistan contained a string of 14 additional, probably more recently acquired spacers indicating that this genetic lineage has or had until recently the capacity to acquire new spacers. Comparison of CRISPR arrays with previously obtained molecular typing data, such as amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP), variable-number of tandem-repeats (VNTR) and genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), demonstrated that these methods reveal similar evolutionary trajectories. Notably, genome analyses allowed to generate a model for CRISPR array evolution in X. citri pv. citri, which provides a new framework for the genealogy of the citrus canker pathogen.	CRISPR-based typing will further improve the accuracy of the genetic identification of X. citri pv. citri outbreak strains in molecular epidemiology analyses, especially when used concomitantly with another genotyping method.

31790395	Symbiotic bacteria are pervasive in mosquitoes and their presence can influence many host phenotypes that affect vectoral capacity. While it is evident that environmental and host genetic factors contribute in shaping the microbiome of mosquitoes, we have a poor understanding regarding how bacterial genetics affects colonization of the mosquito gut. The CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system is a powerful tool to alter bacterial genomes facilitating investigations into host-microbe interactions but has yet to be applied to insect symbionts.	To investigate the role of bacterial genetic factors in mosquito biology and in colonization of mosquitoes we used CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system to mutate the outer membrane protein A (ompA) gene of a Cedecea neteri symbiont isolated from Aedes mosquitoes. The ompA mutant had an impaired ability to form biofilms and poorly infected Ae. aegypti when reared in a mono-association under gnotobiotic conditions. In adult mosquitoes, the mutant had a significantly reduced infection prevalence compared to the wild type or complement strains, while no differences in prevalence were seen in larvae, suggesting genetic factors are particularly important for adult gut colonization. We also used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to integrate genes (antibiotic resistance and fluorescent markers) into the symbionts genome and demonstrated that these genes were functional in vitro and in vivo.	Our results shed insights into the role of ompA gene in host-microbe interactions in Ae. aegypti and confirm that CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing can be employed for genetic manipulation of non-model gut microbes. The ability to use this technology for site-specific integration of genes into the symbiont will facilitate the development of paratransgenic control strategies to interfere with arboviral pathogens such Chikungunya, dengue, Zika and Yellow fever viruses transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes.

31784732	Core regulatory transcription factors (CR TFs) orchestrate the placement of super-enhancers (SEs) to activate transcription of cell-identity specifying gene networks, and are critical in promoting cancer. Here, we define the core regulatory circuitry of rhabdomyosarcoma and identify critical CR TF dependencies. These CR TFs build SEs that have the highest levels of histone acetylation, yet paradoxically the same SEs also harbor the greatest amounts of histone deacetylases. We find that hyperacetylation selectively halts CR TF transcription. To investigate the architectural determinants of this phenotype, we used absolute quantification of architecture (AQuA) HiChIP, which revealed erosion of native SE contacts, and aberrant spreading of contacts that involved histone acetylation. Hyperacetylation removes RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) from core regulatory genetic elements, and eliminates RNA Pol II but not BRD4 phase condensates. This study identifies an SE-specific requirement for balancing histone modification states to maintain SE architecture and CR TF transcription.

31784727	Enhancer elements in the human genome control how genes are expressed in specific cell types and harbor thousands of genetic variants that influence risk for common diseases1-4. Yet, we still do not know how enhancers regulate specific genes, and we lack general rules to predict enhancer-gene connections across cell types5,6. We developed an experimental approach, CRISPRi-FlowFISH, to perturb enhancers in the genome, and we applied it to test >3,500 potential enhancer-gene connections for 30 genes. We found that a simple activity-by-contact model substantially outperformed previous methods at predicting the complex connections in our CRISPR dataset. This activity-by-contact model allows us to construct genome-wide maps of enhancer-gene connections in a given cell type, on the basis of chromatin state measurements. Together, CRISPRi-FlowFISH and the activity-by-contact model provide a systematic approach to map and predict which enhancers regulate which genes, and will help to interpret the functions of the thousands of disease risk variants in the noncoding genome.

31784531	CRISPR-Cas9 is an efficient and versatile tool for genome engineering in many species. However, inducible CRISPR-Cas9 editing systems that regulate Cas9 activity or sgRNA expression often suffer from significant limitations, including reduced editing capacity, off-target effects, or leaky expression. Here, we develop a precisely controlled sgRNA expression cassette that can be combined with widely-used Cre systems, termed CRISPR-Switch (SgRNA With Induction/Termination by Cre Homologous recombination). Switch-ON facilitates controlled, rapid induction of sgRNA activity. In turn, Switch-OFF-mediated termination of editing improves generation of heterozygous genotypes and can limit off-target effects. Furthermore, we design sequential CRISPR-Switch-based editing of two loci in a strictly programmable manner and determined the order of mutagenic events that leads to development of glioblastoma in mice. Thus, CRISPR-Switch substantially increases the versatility of gene editing through precise and rapid switching ON or OFF sgRNA activity, as well as switching OVER to secondary sgRNAs.

31781808	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) consists of a series of regular repeat-spacer sequences. It can not only act as a natural immune system in most prokaryotes, but also be utilized as the tool of newly developed genome modification and evolutionary researches. Streptococcus thermophilus is an important model organism for the study and application of CRISPR systems. In present study, the occurrence and diversity of CRISPR-Cas systems in the genomes of S. thermophilus were investigated including 4 new sequenced strains CS5, CS9, CS18, CS20, and other 23 strains downloaded from NCBI website. 66 CRISPR/Cas systems were identified among these 27 strains and could divided into four subsystems according to the arrangement of Cas proteins, notably I-E, II-A, II-C and III-A. Overall, 26 type II-C systems, 18 type II-A systems, 13 type III-A systems, 9 type I-E systems were identified. It was mentioned that CS20 contained two type II-C systems which had not been identified in the other 26 S. thermophilus strains. Overall, 1,080 spacers were analyzed and blasted. Sequence identity searches of spacers implied that most spacers derived from partial sequences of exogenous DNA, including various bacteriophages and plasmids. Of note, a large number of novel spacers were found in this study, indicating the unique phage environment they have undergone, especially CS20 strain. In addition, the analysis of the cas1 and cas9 genes revealed the genetic relationship among CRISPR-Cas system in these strains. Furthermore, the analysis of CRISPR spacers also indicated protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequences. Summary of PAM sequences could lay the foundations for the application of S. thermophilus CRISPR-Cas system. Our results suggested CS5 and CS18 can be used as model strains in the research of CRISPR-Cas system, and CS20 might have greater application potential in gene editing.	T Hu|Y Cui|X Qu
31770415	We developed a simple method to apply CRISPR interference by modifying an existing plasmid pCRISPathBrick containing the native S. pyogenes CRISPR assembly for Synechocystis PCC6803 and named it pCRPB1010. The technique presented here using deadCas9 is easier to implement for gene silencing in Synechocystis PCC6803 than other existing techniques as it circumvents the genome integration and segregation steps thereby significantly shortens the construction of the mutant strains. We executed CRISPR interference against well characterized photosynthetic genes to get a clear phenotype to validate the potential of pCRPB1010 and presented the work as a "proof of concept". Targeting the non-template strand of psbO gene resulted in decreased amount of PsbO and 50% decrease in oxygen evolution rate. Targeting the template strand of psbA2 and psbA3 genes encoding the D1 subunit of photosystem II (PSII) using a single spacer against the common sequence span of the two genes, resulted in full inhibition of both genes, complete abolition of D1 protein synthesis, complete loss of oxygen evolution as well as photoautotrophic growth arrest. This is the first report of a single plasmid based, completely lesion free and episomal expression and execution of CRISPR interference in Synechocystis PCC6803.

31751606	Triticeae cereals are among the most important crop plants grown worldwide and being used for animal feed, food and beverages. Although breeding efforts evolved over the last ten thousand years our today's crop plants, biotechnological methods would help to speed up the process and incorporate traits impossible by conventional breeding. The main research topics were related to cover the future demand on our agricultural practices to supply sufficient food for a growing world population. Target traits are resistances against viral and fungal diseases, improvement of water and nitrogen use efficiency, to tackle plant architecture, both below and aboveground and to develop varieties that could grow on dry or salty locations. Other applications are considering accumulation of useful compounds or decreasing allergenicity. This review will summarize methods to generate the material including a section how genome engineering using gRNA/Cas (CRISPR/Cas) technology could further improve the methodology and will give an overview about recent and future applications.

31742555	Curative cancer therapies are uncommon and nearly always involve multi-drug combinations developed by experimentation in humans; unfortunately, the mechanistic basis for the success of such combinations has rarely been investigated in detail, obscuring lessons learned. Here, we use isobologram analysis to score pharmacological interaction, and clone tracing and CRISPR screening to measure cross-resistance among the five drugs comprising R-CHOP, a combination therapy that frequently cures Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphomas. We find that drugs in R-CHOP exhibit very low cross-resistance but not synergistic interaction: together they achieve a greater fractional kill according to the null hypothesis for both the Loewe dose-additivity model and the Bliss effect-independence model. These data provide direct evidence for the 50 year old hypothesis that a curative cancer therapy can be constructed on the basis of independently effective drugs having non-overlapping mechanisms of resistance, without synergistic interaction, which has immediate significance for the design of new drug combinations.

31735642	CRISPR-Cas systems encode RNA-guided surveillance complexes to find and cleave invading DNA elements. While it is thought that invaders are neutralized minutes after cell entry, the mechanism and kinetics of target search and its impact on CRISPR protection levels have remained unknown. Here, we visualize individual Cascade complexes in a native type I CRISPR-Cas system. We uncover an exponential relation between Cascade copy number and CRISPR interference levels, pointing to a time-driven arms race between invader replication and target search, in which 20 Cascade complexes provide 50% protection. Driven by PAM-interacting subunit Cas8e, Cascade spends half its search time rapidly probing DNA (∼30 ms) in the nucleoid. We further demonstrate that target DNA transcription and CRISPR arrays affect the integrity of Cascade and affect CRISPR interference. Our work establishes the mechanism of cellular DNA surveillance by Cascade that allows the timely detection of invading DNA in a crowded, DNA-packed environment.

31733872	Lactococcus lactis, one of the most important probiotic lactic acid bacteria (LAB), is widely used in the dairy industry as a cell factory for recombinant protein production. Currently, a nisin-controlled inducible expression system is used for this purpose and represents the only commercial expression system in LAB. However, the available genetic modification methods are rather limited for modulating gene expression in L. lactis. Here, we developed a 2-plasmid system for gene transcription repression in L. lactis NZ9000 that uses inducible clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-dCas9. An inducible promoter Pnisin was used to drive the expression of dCas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes, whereas a strong constitutive promoter P44 drove single guide RNA expression for single or multiple target genes. dCas9 enabled CRISPR interference-mediated silencing of single or multiple target genes with significant reduction of gene expression, up to 99%. In addition, LLNZ_07335, a putative penicillin acylase, was identified as bile salt hydrolase for bile salt resistance in NZ9000 using this system. To our knowledge, this report is the first for a functional gene for bile salt tolerance in L. lactis. Overall, our work introduces a new gene repression tool for various applications in L. lactis or other LAB.	ZQ Xiong|YY Wei|LH Kong|X Song|HX Yi|LZ Ai
31729390	CRISPR-Cas immunity is at the forefront of antivirus defense in bacteria and archaea and specifically targets viruses carrying protospacers matching the spacers catalogued in the CRISPR arrays. Here, we perform deep sequencing of the CRISPRome-all spacers contained in a microbiome-associated with hyperthermophilic archaea of the order Sulfolobales recovered directly from an environmental sample and from enrichment cultures established in the laboratory. The 25 million CRISPR spacers sequenced from a single sampling site dwarf the diversity of spacers from all available Sulfolobales isolates and display complex temporal dynamics. Comparison of closely related virus strains shows that CRISPR targeting drives virus genome evolution. Furthermore, we show that some archaeal viruses carry mini-CRISPR arrays with 1-2 spacers and preceded by leader sequences but devoid of cas genes. Closely related viruses present in the same population carry spacers against each other. Targeting by these virus-borne spacers represents a distinct mechanism of heterotypic superinfection exclusion and appears to promote archaeal virus speciation.

31727847	Although millions of transcription factor binding sites, or cistromes, have been identified across the human genome, defining which of these sites is functional in a given condition remains challenging. Using CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screens and gene essentiality or fitness as the readout, we systematically investigated the essentiality of over 10,000 FOXA1 and CTCF binding sites in breast and prostate cancer cells. We found that essential FOXA1 binding sites act as enhancers to orchestrate the expression of nearby essential genes through the binding of lineage-specific transcription factors. In contrast, CRISPR screens of the CTCF cistrome revealed 2 classes of essential binding sites. The first class of essential CTCF binding sites act like FOXA1 sites as enhancers to regulate the expression of nearby essential genes, while a second class of essential CTCF binding sites was identified at topologically associated domain (TAD) boundaries and display distinct characteristics. Using regression methods trained on our screening data and public epigenetic profiles, we developed a model to predict essential cis-elements with high accuracy. The model for FOXA1 essentiality correctly predicts noncoding variants associated with cancer risk and progression. Taken together, CRISPR screens of cis-regulatory elements can define the essential cistrome of a given factor and can inform the development of predictive models of cistrome function.

31727474	Genome editing (GE) has revolutionized biological research through the new ability to precisely edit the genomes of living organisms. In recent years, various GE tools have been explored for editing simple and complex genomes. The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 system has widely been used in GE due to its high efficiency, ease of use, and accuracy. It can be used to add desirable and remove undesirable alleles simultaneously in a single event. Here, we discuss various applications of CRISPR/Cas9 in a range of important crops, compare it with other GE tools, and review its mechanism, limitations, and future possibilities. Various newly emerging CRISPR/Cas systems, including base editing (BE), xCas9, and Cas12a (Cpf1), are also considered.	H Manghwar|K Lindsey|X Zhang|S Jin

31709671	The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) enzyme, Cas13a, holds great promise in cancer treatment due to its potential for selective destruction of tumor cells via collateral effects after target recognition. However, these collateral effects do not specifically target tumor cells and may cause safety issues when administered systemically. Herein, a dual-locking nanoparticle (DLNP) that can restrict CRISPR/Cas13a activation to tumor tissues is described. DLNP has a core-shell structure, in which the CRISPR/Cas13a system (plasmid DNA, pDNA) is encapsulated inside the core with a dual-responsive polymer layer. This polymer layer endows the DLNP with enhanced stability during blood circulation or in normal tissues and facilitates cellular internalization of the CRISPR/Cas13a system and activation of gene editing upon entry into tumor tissue. After carefully screening and optimizing the CRISPR RNA (crRNA) sequence that targets programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), DLNP demonstrates the effective activation of T-cell-mediated antitumor immunity and the reshaping of immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) in B16F10-bearing mice, resulting in significantly enhanced antitumor effect and improved survival rate. Further development by replacing the specific crRNA of target genes can potentially make DLNP a universal platform for the rapid development of safe and efficient cancer immunotherapies.

31687377	Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) provides acquired immunity in microorganisms against exogenous DNA that may hinder the survival of the organism. Pioneering work by Doudna and Charpentier in 2012 resulted in the creation of the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tool on the basis of this concept. The aim of this was to create a rapid, efficient, and versatile genome-editing tool to facilitate genetic manipulation. The mechanism relies on two components: the RNA guide which acts as a sentinel and a Cas protein complex which functions as a highly precise molecular knife. The guide RNA can be modified to match a DNA sequence of interest in the cell and accordingly be used to rectify mutations that may otherwise cause disease. Within a few years following the development of the CRISPR/Cas9 tool, its usage has become ubiquitous. Its influence extends into many fields of biological sciences from biotechnology and biochemistry to molecular biology and biomedical sciences. The following review aims at shedding some light on to the applications of the CRISPR/Cas9 tool in the field of biomedical sciences, particularly gene therapy. An insight with relation to a few of the many diseases that are being tackled with the aid of the CRISPR/Cas9 mechanism and the trends, successes, and challenges of this application as a gene therapy are discussed in this review.

31682364	The discovery of CRISPR systems has been one of the most exciting developments in the field of genetics in the past decade. The recent proliferation of intellectual property rights for CRISPR genome editing technology carries the risk of potential bottlenecks for further basic biological research and development of commercial products. To make CRISPR-based technology widely available, the reliance by the industry on efficient methods of collective management of intellectual property rights through patent pools seems inevitable. A packager of patent pools could be used as a mechanism to facilitate transactions in the market for technology and allow interested parties to deal with a single entity. This article argues that, while a global licensing platform could be effectively achieved in non-therapeutic applications of genome editing, it is questionable whether patent pooling would provide the ideal balance of incentive and reward for CRISPR genome editing technologies for human gene therapy.

31674908	We previously reported a CRISPR-mediated knock-in strategy into introns of Drosophila genes, generating an attP-FRT-SA-T2A-GAL4-polyA-3XP3-EGFP-FRT-attP transgenic library for multiple uses (Lee et al., 2018a). The method relied on double stranded DNA (dsDNA) homology donors with ~1 kb homology arms. Here, we describe three new simpler ways to edit genes in flies. We create single stranded DNA (ssDNA) donors using PCR and add 100 nt of homology on each side of an integration cassette, followed by enzymatic removal of one strand. Using this method, we generated GFP-tagged proteins that mark organelles in S2 cells. We then describe two dsDNA methods using cheap synthesized donors flanked by 100 nt homology arms and gRNA target sites cloned into a plasmid. Upon injection, donor DNA (1 to 5 kb) is released from the plasmid by Cas9. The cassette integrates efficiently and precisely in vivo. The approach is fast, cheap, and scalable.

31668930	High-resolution Cas9 structures have yet to reveal catalytic conformations due to HNH nuclease domain positioning away from the cleavage site. Nme1Cas9 and Nme2Cas9 are compact nucleases for in vivo genome editing. Here, we report structures of meningococcal Cas9 homologs in complex with sgRNA, dsDNA, or the AcrIIC3 anti-CRISPR protein. DNA-bound structures represent an early step of target recognition, a later HNH pre-catalytic state, the HNH catalytic state, and a cleaved-target-DNA-bound state. In the HNH catalytic state of Nme1Cas9, the active site is seen poised at the scissile phosphodiester linkage of the target strand, providing a high-resolution view of the active conformation. The HNH active conformation activates the RuvC domain. Our structures explain how Nme1Cas9 and Nme2Cas9 read distinct PAM sequences and how AcrIIC3 inhibits Nme1Cas9 activity. These structures provide insights into Cas9 domain rearrangements, guide-target engagement, cleavage mechanism, and anti-CRISPR inhibition, facilitating the optimization of these genome-editing platforms.

31666016	Clade 5 Clostridioides difficile diverges significantly from the other clades and is therefore, attracting increasing attention due its great heterogeneity. In this study, we used third-generation sequencing techniques to sequence the complete whole genomes of three ST11 C. difficile isolates, RT078 and another two new ribotypes (RTs), obtained from three independent hospitalized elderly patients undergoing antibiotics treatment. Mobile genetic elements (MGEs), antibiotic-resistance, drug resistance genes, and virulent-related genes were analyzed and compared within these three isolates.	Isolates 10,010 and 12,038 carried a distinct deletion in tcdA compared with isolate 21,062. Furthermore, all three isolates had identical deletions and point-mutations in tcdC, which was once thought to be a unique characteristic of RT078. Isolate 21,062 (RT078) had a unique plasmid, different numbers of transposons and genetic organization, and harboring special CRISPR spacers. All three isolates retained high-level sensitivity to 11 drugs and isolate 21,062 (RT078) carried distinct drug-resistance genes and loss of numerous flagellum-related genes.	We concluded that capillary electrophoresis based PCR-ribotyping is important for confirming RT078. Furthermore, RT078 isolates displayed specific MGEs, indicating an independent evolutionary process. In the further study, we could testify these findings with more RT078 isolates of divergent origins.	Y Wu|L Yang|WG Li|WZ Zhang|ZJ Liu|JX Lu
31663165	Noncoding small RNAs, such as microRNAs, are becoming the biomarkers of choice for multiple diseases in clinical diagnostics. A dysregulation of these microRNAs can be associated with many different diseases, such as cancer, dementia, and cardiovascular conditions. The key for effective treatment is an accurate initial diagnosis at an early stage, improving the patient's survival chances. In this work, the first clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas13a-powered microfluidic, integrated electrochemical biosensor for the on-site detection of microRNAs is introduced. Through this unique combination, the quantification of the potential tumor markers microRNA miR-19b and miR-20a is realized without any nucleic acid amplification. With a readout time of 9 min and an overall process time of less than 4 h, a limit of detection of 10 pm is achieved, using a measuring volume of less than 0.6 µL. Furthermore, the feasibility of the biosensor platform to detect miR-19b in serum samples of children, suffering from brain cancer, is demonstrated. The validation of the obtained results with a standard quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction method shows the ability of the electrochemical CRISPR-powered system to be a low-cost, easily scalable, and target amplification-free tool for nucleic acid based diagnostics.

31658298	Inactive fusion variants of the CRISPR-Cas9 system are increasingly being used as standard methodology to study transcription regulation. Their ability to readily manipulate the native genomic loci is particularly advantageous. In this work, we serendipitously uncover the key cytokine IL6 as an off-target of the activating derivative of CRISPR (CRISPRa) while studying RP11-326A19.4, a novel long-non coding RNA (lncRNA). Increasing RP11-326A19.4 expression in HEK293T cells via CRISPRa-mediated activation of its promoter region induced genome-wide transcriptional changes, including upregulation of IL6, an important cytokine. IL6 was increased in response to distinct sgRNA targeting the RP11-326A19.4 promoter region, suggesting specificity. Loss of the cognate sgRNA recognition sites failed to abolish CRISPRa mediated activation of IL6 however, pointing to off-target effects. Bioinformatic approaches did not reveal predicted off-target binding sites. Off-target activation of IL6 was sustained and involved low level activation of known IL6 regulators. Increased IL6 remained sensitive to further activation by TNFα, consistent with the existence of independent mechanisms. This study provides experimental evidence that CRISPRa has discrete, unpredictable off-targeting limitations that must be considered when using this emerging technology.

31658261	CRISPR-Cas is a powerful genome editing technology and has a great potential for in vivo gene therapy. Successful translational application of CRISPR-Cas to biomedicine still faces many safety concerns, including off-target side effect, cell fitness problem after CRISPR-Cas treatment, and on-target genome editing side effect in undesired tissues. To solve these issues, it is needed to design sgRNA with high cell-specific efficacy and specificity. Existing single-guide RNA (sgRNA) design tools mainly depend on a sgRNA sequence and the local information of the targeted genome, thus are not sufficient to account for the difference in the cellular response of the same gene in different cell types. To incorporate cell-specific information into the sgRNA design, we develop novel interpretable machine learning models, which integrate features learned from advanced transformer-based deep neural network with cell-specific gene property derived from biological network and gene expression profile, for the prediction of CRISPR-Cas9 and CRISPR-Cas12a efficacy and specificity. In benchmark studies, our models significantly outperform state-of-the-art algorithms. Furthermore, we find that the network-based gene property is critical for the prediction of cell-specific post-treatment cellular response. Our results suggest that the design of efficient and safe CRISPR-Cas needs to consider cell-specific information of genes. Our findings may bolster developing more accurate predictive models of CRISPR-Cas across a broad spectrum of biological conditions as well as provide new insight into developing efficient and safe CRISPR-based gene therapy.

31657721	Previously we proposed that transmission of the hedgehog signal across the plasma membrane by Smoothened is triggered by its interaction with cholesterol (Luchetti et al., 2016). But how is cholesterol, an abundant lipid, regulated tightly enough to control a signaling system that can cause birth defects and cancer? Using toxin-based sensors that distinguish between distinct pools of cholesterol, we find that Smoothened activation and Hedgehog signaling are driven by a biochemically-defined, small fraction of membrane cholesterol, termed accessible cholesterol. Increasing cholesterol accessibility by depletion of sphingomyelin, which sequesters cholesterol in complexes, amplifies Hedgehog signaling. Hedgehog ligands increase cholesterol accessibility in the membrane of the primary cilium by inactivating the transporter-like protein Patched 1. Trapping this accessible cholesterol blocks Hedgehog signal transmission across the membrane. Our work shows that the organization of cholesterol in the ciliary membrane can be modified by extracellular ligands to control the activity of cilia-localized signaling proteins.

31649057	Mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) are key components in generating mouse models for human diseases and performing basic research on pluripotency, yet the number of genes essential for mESCs is still unknown. We performed a genome-wide screen for essential genes in mESCs and compared it to screens in human cells. We found that essential genes are enriched for basic cellular functions, are highly expressed in mESCs, and tend to lack paralog genes. We discovered that genes that are essential specifically in mESCs play a role in pathways associated with their pluripotent state. We show that 29.5% of human genes intolerant to loss-of-function mutations are essential in mouse or human ESCs, and that the human phenotypes most significantly associated with genes essential for ESCs are neurodevelopmental. Our results provide insights into essential genes in the mouse, the pathways which govern pluripotency, and suggest that many genes associated with neurodevelopmental disorders are essential at very early embryonic stages.

31641111	The S-layer is a proteinaceous surface lattice found in the cell envelope of bacteria and archaea. In most archaea, a glycosylated S-layer constitutes the sole cell wall and there is evidence that it contributes to cell shape maintenance and stress resilience. Here we use a gene-knockdown technology based on an endogenous CRISPR type III complex to gradually silence slaB, which encodes the S-layer membrane anchor in the hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus. Silenced cells exhibit a reduced or peeled-off S-layer lattice, cell shape alterations and decreased surface glycosylation. These cells barely propagate but increase in diameter and DNA content, indicating impaired cell division; their phenotypes can be rescued through genetic complementation. Furthermore, S-layer depleted cells are less susceptible to infection with the virus SSV1. Our study highlights the usefulness of the CRISPR type III system for gene silencing in archaea, and supports that an intact S-layer is important for cell division and virus susceptibility.

31626589	Acinetobacter baumannii is an opportunistic bacterium that causes hospital-acquired infections with a high mortality and morbidity, since there are strains resistant to virtually any kind of antibiotic. The chase to find novel strategies to fight against this microbe can be favoured by knowledge of the complete catalogue of genes of the species, and their relationship with the specific characteristics of different isolates. In this work, we performed a genomics analysis of almost 2500 strains. Two different groups of genomes were found based on the number of shared genes. One of these groups rarely has plasmids, and bears clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) sequences, in addition to CRISPR-associated genes (cas genes) or restriction-modification system genes. This fact strongly supports the lack of plasmids. Furthermore, the scarce plasmids in this group also bear CRISPR sequences, and specifically contain genes involved in prokaryotic toxin-antitoxin systems that could either act as the still little known CRISPR type IV system or be the precursors of other novel CRISPR/Cas systems. In addition, a limited set of strains present a new cas9-like gene, which may complement the other cas genes in inhibiting the entrance of new plasmids into the bacteria. Finally, this group has exclusive genes involved in biofilm formation, which would connect CRISPR systems to the biogenesis of these bacterial resistance structures.

31626299	Pathogens constantly interact with their hosts and the environment, and therefore have evolved unique virulence mechanisms to target and breach host defense barriers and manipulate host immune response to establish an infection. Advances in technologies that allow genome mining, gene editing such as CRISPR/Cas9, genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic studies such as dual RNA-seq, coupled with bioinformatics, have accelerated the field of host-pathogen interactions within a broad range of infection models. Underpinning of the molecular changes that accompany invasion of eukaryotic cells with pathogenic microorganisms at the intersection of host, pathogen and their local environment has provided a better understanding of infectious disease mechanisms and antimicrobial strategies. The recent evolution of physiologically relevant three-dimensional (3-D) tissue/organ models and microfluidic organ-on-chip devices also provided a window to a more predictive framework of infectious disease processes. These approaches combined hold the potential to highly impact discovery of novel drug targets and vaccine candidates of the future. Here, we review three of the available and emerging technologies-dual RNA-seq, CRISPR/Cas9 screening and organs-on-chips, applicable to the high throughput study and deciphering of interaction networks between pathogens and their hosts that are critical for the development of novel therapeutics.

31624845	In Archaea and Bacteria, the arrays called CRISPRs for 'clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats' and the CRISPR associated genes or cas provide adaptive immunity against viruses, plasmids and transposable elements. Short sequences called spacers, corresponding to fragments of invading DNA, are stored in-between repeated sequences. The CRISPR-Cas systems target sequences homologous to spacers leading to their degradation. To facilitate investigations of CRISPRs, we developed 12 years ago a website holding the CRISPRdb. We now propose CRISPRCasdb, a completely new version giving access to both CRISPRs and cas genes. We used CRISPRCasFinder, a program that identifies CRISPR arrays and cas genes and determine the system's type and subtype, to process public whole genome assemblies. Strains are displayed either in an alphabetic list or in taxonomic order. The database is part of the CRISPR-Cas++ website which also offers the possibility to analyse submitted sequences and to download programs. A BLAST search against lists of repeats and spacers extracted from the database is proposed. To date, 16 990 complete prokaryote genomes (16 650 bacteria from 2973 species and 340 archaea from 300 species) are included. CRISPR-Cas systems were found in 36% of Bacteria and 75% of Archaea strains. CRISPRCasdb is freely accessible at https://crisprcas.i2bc.paris-saclay.fr/.

31611701	Immunotherapy has transformed cancer treatment. However, current immunotherapy modalities face various limitations. In the present study, we developed multiplexed activation of endogenous genes as an immunotherapy (MAEGI), a new form of immunotherapy that elicits antitumor immunity through multiplexed activation of endogenous genes in tumors. We leveraged CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) to directly augment the in situ expression of endogenous genes, and thereby the presentation of tumor antigens, leading to dramatic antitumor immune responses. Deploying this as a cell-based vaccination strategy showed efficacy in both prophylactic and therapeutic settings. Intratumoral adeno-associated virus delivery of CRISPRa libraries elicited strong antitumor immunity across multiple cancer types. Precision targeting of mutated gene sets eradicated a large fraction of established tumors at both local and distant sites. This treatment modality led to alterations in the tumor microenvironment, marked by enhanced T cell infiltration and antitumor immune signatures. Multiplexed endogenous gene activation is a versatile and highly scalable strategy to elicit potent immune responses against cancer, distinct from all existing cancer therapies.

31607545	The CRISPR effector Cas13 could be an effective antiviral for single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses because it programmably cleaves RNAs complementary to its CRISPR RNA (crRNA). Here, we computationally identify thousands of potential Cas13 crRNA target sites in hundreds of ssRNA viral species that can potentially infect humans. We experimentally demonstrate Cas13's potent activity against three distinct ssRNA viruses: lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV); influenza A virus (IAV); and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Combining this antiviral activity with Cas13-based diagnostics, we develop Cas13-assisted restriction of viral expression and readout (CARVER), an end-to-end platform that uses Cas13 to detect and destroy viral RNA. We further screen hundreds of crRNAs along the LCMV genome to evaluate how conservation and target RNA nucleotide content influence Cas13's antiviral activity. Our results demonstrate that Cas13 can be harnessed to target a wide range of ssRNA viruses and CARVER's potential broad utility for rapid diagnostic and antiviral drug development.

31604602	In the arms race against bacteria, bacteriophages have evolved diverse anti-CRISPR proteins (Acrs) that block CRISPR-Cas immunity. Acrs play key roles in the molecular coevolution of bacteria with their predators, use a variety of mechanisms of action, and provide tools to regulate Cas-based genome manipulation. Here, we present structural and functional analyses of AcrIIA6, an Acr from virulent phages, exploring its unique anti-CRISPR action. Our cryo-EM structures and functional data of AcrIIA6 binding to Streptococcus thermophilus Cas9 (St1Cas9) show that AcrIIA6 acts as an allosteric inhibitor and induces St1Cas9 dimerization. AcrIIA6 reduces St1Cas9 binding affinity for DNA and prevents DNA binding within cells. The PAM and AcrIIA6 recognition sites are structurally close and allosterically linked. Mechanistically, AcrIIA6 affects the St1Cas9 conformational dynamics associated with PAM binding. Finally, we identify a natural St1Cas9 variant resistant to AcrIIA6 illustrating Acr-driven mutational escape and molecular diversification of Cas9 proteins.

31603896	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas systems have been harnessed as powerful genome editing tools in diverse organisms. However, the off-target effects and the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) compatibility restrict the therapeutic applications of these systems. Recently, a Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) variant, xCas9, was evolved to possess both broad PAM compatibility and high DNA fidelity. Through determination of multiple xCas9 structures, which are all in complex with single-guide RNA (sgRNA) and double-stranded DNA containing different PAM sequences (TGG, CGG, TGA, and TGC), we decipher the molecular mechanisms of the PAM expansion and fidelity enhancement of xCas9. xCas9 follows a unique two-mode PAM recognition mechanism. For non-NGG PAM recognition, xCas9 triggers a notable structural rearrangement in the DNA recognition domains and a rotation in the key PAM-interacting residue R1335; such mechanism has not been observed in the wild-type (WT) SpCas9. For NGG PAM recognition, xCas9 applies a strategy similar to WT SpCas9. Moreover, biochemical and cell-based genome editing experiments pinpointed the critical roles of the E1219V mutation for PAM expansion and the R324L, S409I, and M694I mutations for fidelity enhancement. The molecular-level characterizations of the xCas9 nuclease provide critical insights into the mechanisms of the PAM expansion and fidelity enhancement of xCas9 and could further facilitate the engineering of SpCas9 and other Cas9 orthologs.

31600500	Toxoplasma can reach distant organs, especially the brain, leading to a lifelong chronic phase. However, genes involved in related in vivo processes are currently unknown. Here, we use focused CRISPR libraries to identify Toxoplasma genes that affect in vivo fitness. We focus on TgWIP, whose deletion affects Toxoplasma dissemination to distant organs. We show that TgWIP is secreted into the host cell upon invasion and interacts with the host WAVE regulatory complex and SHP2 phosphatase, both of which regulate actin dynamics. TgWIP affects the morphology of dendritic cells and mediates the dissolution of podosomes, which dendritic cells use to adhere to extracellular matrix. TgWIP enhances the motility and transmigration of parasitized dendritic cells, likely explaining its effect on in vivo fitness. Our results provide a framework for systemic identification of Toxoplasma genes with in vivo effects at the site of infection or on dissemination to distant organs, including the brain.

31600234	Three human clinical isolates of bacteria (designated strains Em1, Em2 and Em3) had high average nucleotide identity (ANI) to Elizabethkingia meningoseptica. Their genome sizes (3.89, 4.04 and 4.04 Mb) were comparable to those of other Elizabethkingia species and strains, and exhibited open pan-genome characteristics, with two strains being nearly identical and the third divergent. These strains were susceptible only to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and ciprofloxacin amongst 16 antibiotics in minimum inhibitory tests. The resistome exhibited a high diversity of resistance genes, including 5 different lactamase- and 18 efflux protein- encoding genes. Forty-four genes encoding virulence factors were conserved among the strains. Sialic acid transporters and curli synthesis genes were well conserved in E. meningoseptica but absent in E. anophelis and E. miricola. E. meningoseptica carried several genes contributing to biofilm formation. 58 glycoside hydrolases (GH) and 25 putative polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs) were found. The strains carried numerous genes encoding two-component system proteins (56), transcription factor proteins (187~191), and DNA-binding proteins (6~7). Several prophages and CRISPR/Cas elements were uniquely present in the genomes.	S Chen|M Soehnlen|J Blom|N Terrapon|B Henrissat|ED Walker

31585858	Genome manipulation, especially the deletion or replacement of chromosomal regions, is a salient tool for the analysis of genome function. Because of low homologous recombination activity, however, current methods are limited to manipulating only one chromosomal region in a single transformation, making the simultaneous deletion or replacement of multiple chromosomal regions difficult, laborious, and time-consuming. Here, we have developed two highly efficient and versatile genome engineering technologies, named clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-PCR-mediated chromosomal deletion (PCD) (CRISPR-PCD) and PCR-mediated chromosomal replacement (CRISPR-PCRep), that integrate the CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) genome editing system (CRISPR/Cas9) into, respectively, the PCD method for chromosomal deletion and our newly developed PCRep method for chromosomal replacement. Integration of CRISPR induces double strand breaks to activate homologous recombination, and thus enhances the efficiency of deletion by PCD and replacement by PCRep, enabling multiple chromosomal regions to be manipulated simultaneously for the first time. Our data show that CRISPR-PCD can delete two internal or terminal chromosomal regions, while CRISPR-PCRep can replace triple chromosomal regions simultaneously in a single transformation. Colony PCR analysis of structural alterations showed that triple replacement of four different sets of chromosomal regions was successful in 83%-100% of transformants analyzed. These novel genome engineering technologies, which greatly reduce time and labor for genome manipulation, will provide powerful tools to facilitate the simultaneous multiple deletion and replacement of chromosomal regions, enabling the rapid analysis of genome function and breeding of useful industrial yeast strains.

31585845	Type II CRISPR-Cas systems defend prokaryotes from bacteriophage infection through the acquisition of short viral DNA sequences known as spacers, which are transcribed into short RNA guides to specify the targets of the Cas9 nuclease. To counter the potentially devastating propagation of escaper phages with mutations in the target sequences, the host population acquires many different spacers. Whether and how pre-existing spacers in type II systems affect the acquisition of new ones is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that previously acquired spacers promote additional spacer acquisition from the vicinity of the target DNA site cleaved by Cas9. Therefore, CRISPR immune cells acquire additional spacers at the same time as they destroy the infecting virus. This anticipates the rise of escapers or related viruses that could escape targeting by the first spacer acquired. Our results thus reveal Cas9's role in the generation of immunological memories.

31581942	Efficient and convenient genome-editing toolkits can expedite genomic research and strain improvement for desirable phenotypes. Zymomonas mobilis is a highly efficient ethanol-producing bacterium with a small genome size and desirable industrial characteristics, which makes it a promising chassis for biorefinery and synthetic biology studies. While classical techniques for genetic manipulation are available for Z. mobilis, efficient genetic engineering toolkits enabling rapidly systematic and high-throughput genome editing in Z. mobilis are still lacking.	Using Cas12a (Cpf1) from Francisella novicida, a recombinant strain with inducible cas12a expression for genome editing was constructed in Z. mobilis ZM4, which can be used to mediate RNA-guided DNA cleavage at targeted genomic loci. gRNAs were then designed targeting the replicons of native plasmids of ZM4 with about 100% curing efficiency for three native plasmids. In addition, CRISPR-Cas12a recombineering was used to promote gene deletion and insertion in one step efficiently and precisely with efficiency up to 90%. Combined with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), CRISPR-Cas12a system was also applied to introduce minor nucleotide modification precisely into the genome with high fidelity. Furthermore, the CRISPR-Cas12a system was employed to introduce a heterologous lactate dehydrogenase into Z. mobilis with a recombinant lactate-producing strain constructed.	This study applied CRISPR-Cas12a in Z. mobilis and established a genome editing tool for efficient and convenient genome engineering in Z. mobilis including plasmid curing, gene deletion and insertion, as well as nucleotide substitution, which can also be employed for metabolic engineering to help divert the carbon flux from ethanol production to other products such as lactate demonstrated in this work. The CRISPR-Cas12a system established in this study thus provides a versatile and powerful genome-editing tool in Z. mobilis for functional genomic research, strain improvement, as well as synthetic microbial chassis development for economic biochemical production.

31570731	Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors have shown promising results in preclinical models, but the genomic consequences of transduction with AAV vectors encoding CRISPR-Cas nucleases is still being examined. In this study, we observe high levels of AAV integration (up to 47%) into Cas9-induced double-strand breaks (DSBs) in therapeutically relevant genes in cultured murine neurons, mouse brain, muscle and cochlea. Genome-wide AAV mapping in mouse brain shows no overall increase of AAV integration except at the CRISPR/Cas9 target site. To allow detailed characterization of integration events we engineer a miniature AAV encoding a 465 bp lambda bacteriophage DNA (AAV-λ465), enabling sequencing of the entire integrated vector genome. The integration profile of AAV-465λ in cultured cells display both full-length and fragmented AAV genomes at Cas9 on-target sites. Our data indicate that AAV integration should be recognized as a common outcome for applications that utilize AAV for genome editing.

31567362	Transgenic mouse studies suggest that γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors containing β3 subunits mediate important effects of etomidate, propofol, and pentobarbital. Zebrafish, recently introduced for rapid discovery and characterization of sedative-hypnotics, could also accelerate pharmacogenetic studies if their transgenic phenotypes reflect those of mammals. The authors hypothesized that, relative to wild-type, GABAA-β3 functional knock-out (β3) zebrafish would show anesthetic sensitivity changes similar to those of β3 mice.	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 mutagenesis was used to create a β3 zebrafish line. Wild-type and β3 zebrafish were compared for fertility, growth, and craniofacial development. Sedative and hypnotic effects of etomidate, propofol, pentobarbital, alphaxalone, ketamine, tricaine, dexmedetomidine, butanol, and ethanol, along with overall activity and thigmotaxis were quantified in 7-day postfertilization larvae using video motion analysis of up to 96 animals simultaneously.	Xenopus oocyte electrophysiology showed that the wild-type zebrafish β3 gene encodes ion channels activated by propofol and etomidate, while the β3 zebrafish transgene does not. Compared to wild-type, β3 zebrafish showed similar morphology and growth, but more rapid swimming. Hypnotic EC50s (mean [95% CI]) were significantly higher for β3 versus wild-type larvae with etomidate (1.3 [1.0 to 1.6] vs. 0.6 [0.5 to 0.7] µM; P < 0.0001), propofol (1.1 [1.0 to 1.4] vs. 0.7 [0.6 to 0.8] µM; P = 0.0005), and pentobarbital (220 [190 to 240] vs. 130 [94 to 179] μM; P = 0.0009), but lower with ethanol (150 [106 to 213] vs. 380 [340 to 420] mM; P < 0.0001) and equivalent with other tested drugs. Comparing β3 versus wild-type sedative EC50s revealed a pattern similar to hypnosis.	Global β3 zebrafish are selectively insensitive to the same few sedative-hypnotics previously reported in β3 transgenic mice, indicating phylogenetic conservation of β3-containing GABAA receptors as anesthetic targets. Transgenic zebrafish are potentially valuable models for sedative-hypnotic mechanisms research.	X Yang|Y Jounaidi|K Mukherjee|RJ Fantasia|EC Liao|B Yu|SA Forman

31560843	The accelerating pace of scientific discovery is being driven by the development of transformative technologies that are expanding traditional scientific boundaries. In ecology, the concept that ecosystem structure can be monitored through the stew of genetic material released into the environment by local organisms is now a highly active area of research. At the same time that the use of environmental DNA (eDNA) has gained popularity in ecology, CRISPR genome editing technology has been revolutionizing organismal biology and the biomedical sciences. In a From the Cover article in this issue of Molecular Ecology Resources, Williams et al. (2019) report about the fusion of CRISPR technology with molecular ecology to improve the in situ processing capabilities of eDNA applications. Piloting this new CRISPR technology on aquatic systems, the authors describe tools to accurately identify the presence of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) from eDNA, using conditions that are highly amenable to implementation in the field. This overcomes a major barrier restricting the use of eDNA, opening a door to expanded use of the technology in ecological research.	M Phelps

31541109	Type III CRISPR-Cas multisubunit complexes cleave ssRNA and ssDNA. These activities promote the generation of cyclic oligoadenylate (cOA), which activates associated CRISPR-Cas RNases from the Csm/Csx families, triggering a massive RNA decay to provide immunity from genetic invaders. Here we present the structure of Sulfolobus islandicus (Sis) Csx1-cOA4 complex revealing the allosteric activation of its RNase activity. SisCsx1 is a hexamer built by a trimer of dimers. Each dimer forms a cOA4 binding site and a ssRNA catalytic pocket. cOA4 undergoes a conformational change upon binding in the second messenger binding site activating ssRNA degradation in the catalytic pockets. Activation is transmitted in an allosteric manner through an intermediate HTH domain, which joins the cOA4 and catalytic sites. The RNase functions in a sequential cooperative fashion, hydrolyzing phosphodiester bonds in 5'-C-C-3'. The degradation of cOA4 by Ring nucleases deactivates SisCsx1, suggesting that this enzyme could be employed in biotechnological applications.

31541098	Here we develop a methylation editing toolbox, Casilio-ME, that enables not only RNA-guided methylcytosine editing by targeting TET1 to genomic sites, but also by co-delivering TET1 and protein factors that couple methylcytosine oxidation to DNA repair activities, and/or promote TET1 to achieve enhanced activation of methylation-silenced genes. Delivery of TET1 activity by Casilio-ME1 robustly alters the CpG methylation landscape of promoter regions and activates methylation-silenced genes. We augment Casilio-ME1 to simultaneously deliver the TET1-catalytic domain and GADD45A (Casilio-ME2) or NEIL2 (Casilio-ME3) to streamline removal of oxidized cytosine intermediates to enhance activation of targeted genes. Using two-in-one effectors or modular effectors, Casilio-ME2 and Casilio-ME3 remarkably boost gene activation and methylcytosine demethylation of targeted loci. We expand the toolbox to enable a stable and expression-inducible system for broader application of the Casilio-ME platforms. This work establishes a platform for editing DNA methylation to enable research investigations interrogating DNA methylomes.	A Taghbalout|M Du|N Jillette|W Rosikiewicz|A Rath|CD Heinen|S Li|AW Cheng
31540829	During infection, Legionella pneumophila translocates over 300 effector proteins into the host cytosol, allowing the pathogen to establish an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-like Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV) that supports bacterial replication. Here, we perform a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen and secondary targeted screens in U937 human monocyte/macrophage-like cells to systematically identify host factors that regulate killing by L. pneumophila. The screens reveal known host factors hijacked by L. pneumophila, as well as genes spanning diverse trafficking and signaling pathways previously not linked to L. pneumophila pathogenesis. We further characterize C1orf43 and KIAA1109 as regulators of phagocytosis and show that RAB10 and its chaperone RABIF are required for optimal L. pneumophila replication and ER recruitment to the LCV. Finally, we show that Rab10 protein is recruited to the LCV and ubiquitinated by the effectors SidC/SdcA. Collectively, our results provide a wealth of previously undescribed insights into L. pneumophila pathogenesis and mammalian cell function.

31537810	Highly specific Cas9 nucleases derived from SpCas9 are valuable tools for genome editing, but their wide applications are hampered by a lack of knowledge governing guide RNA (gRNA) activity. Here, we perform a genome-scale screen to measure gRNA activity for two highly specific SpCas9 variants (eSpCas9(1.1) and SpCas9-HF1) and wild-type SpCas9 (WT-SpCas9) in human cells, and obtain indel rates of over 50,000 gRNAs for each nuclease, covering ~20,000 genes. We evaluate the contribution of 1,031 features to gRNA activity and develope models for activity prediction. Our data reveals that a combination of RNN with important biological features outperforms other models for activity prediction. We further demonstrate that our model outperforms other popular gRNA design tools. Finally, we develop an online design tool DeepHF for the three Cas9 nucleases. The database, as well as the designer tool, is freely accessible via a web server, http://www.DeepHF.com/ .	D Wang|C Zhang|B Wang|B Li|Q Wang|D Liu|H Wang|Y Zhou|L Shi|F Lan|Y Wang
31535322	Flavonoids are polyphenols that are important organic chemicals in plants. The health benefits of flavonoids that result in high commercial values make them attractive targets for large-scale production through bioengineering. Strategies such as engineering a flavonoid biosynthetic pathway in microbial hosts provide an alternative way to produce these beneficial compounds. Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Streptomyces sp. are among the expression systems used to produce recombinant products, as well as for the production of flavonoid compounds through various bioengineering approaches including clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based genome engineering and genetically encoded biosensors to detect flavonoid biosynthesis. In this study, we review the recent advances in engineering model microbial hosts as being the factory to produce targeted flavonoid compounds.

31522608	Rapid and simple-to-use diagnostic methods for tuberculosis are urgently needed. Recent development has unveiled the diagnostic power of the CRISPR system in the detection of viral infections. However, its potential use in detecting the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTB) remained unexplored. We developed a rapid CRISPR-based assay for TB detection and conducted a retrospective cohort study of 179 patients to evaluate the CRISPR-MTB test for identifying MTB in various forms of direct clinical samples. Its diagnostic performance was compared, in parallel with culture and the GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay (Xpert). The CRISPR-MTB test is highly sensitive with a near single-copy sensitivity, demands less sample input and offers shorter turnaround time than Xpert. When evaluated in the clinical cohort of both pulmonary and extra-pulmonary tuberculosis, the CRISPR-MTB test exhibited an overall improved sensitivity over both culture (79% vs 33%) and Xpert (79% vs 66%), without comprise in specificity (62/63, 98%). The CRISPR-MTB test exhibits an improved overall diagnostic performance over culture and Xpert across a variety of sample types, and offers great potential as a new diagnostic technique for both pulmonary and extra-pulmonary tuberculosis.

31513841	CRISPR/Cas9 system exploits the concerted action of Cas9 nuclease and programmable single guide RNA (sgRNA), and has been widely used for genome editing. The Cas9 nuclease activity can be abolished by mutation to yield the catalytically deactivated Cas9 (dCas9). Coupling with the customizable sgRNA for targeting, dCas9 can be fused with transcription repressors to inhibit specific gene expression (CRISPR interference, CRISPRi) or fused with transcription activators to activate the expression of gene of interest (CRISPR activation, CRISPRa). Here we introduce the principles and recent advances of these CRISPR technologies, their delivery vectors and review their applications in stem cell engineering and regenerative medicine. In particular, we focus on in vitro stem cell fate manipulation and in vivo applications such as prevention of retinal and muscular degeneration, neural regeneration, bone regeneration, cartilage tissue engineering, as well as treatment of diseases in blood, skin and liver. Finally, the challenges to translate CRISPR to regenerative medicine and future perspectives are discussed and proposed.	MN Hsu|YH Chang|VA Truong|PL Lai|TKN Nguyen|YC Hu

31504832	The association of reverse transcriptases (RTs) with CRISPR-Cas system has recently attracted interest because the RT activity appears to facilitate the RT-dependent acquisition of spacers from RNA molecules. However, our understanding of this spacer acquisition process remains limited. We characterized the in vivo acquisition of spacers mediated by an RT-Cas1 fusion protein linked to a type III-D system from Vibrio vulnificus strain YJ016, and showed that the adaptation module, consisting of the RT-Cas1 fusion, two different Cas2 proteins (A and B) and one of the two CRISPR arrays, was completely functional in a heterologous host. We found that mutations of the active site of the RT domain significantly decreased the acquisition of new spacers and showed that this RT-Cas1-associated adaptation module was able to incorporate spacers from RNA molecules into the CRISPR array. We demonstrated that the two Cas2 proteins of the adaptation module were required for spacer acquisition. Furthermore, we found that several sequence-specific features were required for the acquisition and integration of spacers derived from any region of the genome, with no bias along the 5'and 3'ends of coding sequences. This study provides new insight into the RT-Cas1 fusion protein-mediated acquisition of spacers from RNA molecules.	A González-Delgado|MR Mestre|F Martínez-Abarca|N Toro
31501938	Unlike eukaryotes, prokaryotes are less proficient in homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). All existing genomic editing methods for Escherichia coli (E. coli) rely on exogenous HR or NHEJ systems to repair DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Although an E. coli native end-joining (ENEJ) system has been reported, its potential in genetic engineering has not yet been explored. Here, we present a CRISPR-Cas9-assisted native end-joining editing and show that ENEJ-dependent DNA repair can be used to conduct rapid and efficient deletion of chromosome fragments up to 83 kb or gene inactivation. Moreover, the positive rate and editing efficiency are independent of high-efficiency competent cells. The method requires neither exogenous DNA repair systems nor introduced editing template. The Cas9-sgRNA complex is the only foreign element in this method. This study is the first successful engineering effort to utilize ENEJ mechanism in genomic editing and provides an effective strategy for genetic engineering in bacteria that are inefficient in HR and NHEJ.

31489367	Hybridoma technology is instrumental for the development of novel antibody therapeutics and diagnostics. Recent preclinical and clinical studies highlight the importance of antibody isotype for therapeutic efficacy. However, since the sequence encoding the constant domains is fixed, tuning antibody function in hybridomas has been restricted. Here, we demonstrate a versatile CRISPR/HDR platform to rapidly engineer the constant immunoglobulin domains to obtain recombinant hybridomas, which secrete antibodies in the preferred format, species, and isotype. Using this platform, we obtained recombinant hybridomas secreting Fab' fragments, isotype-switched chimeric antibodies, and Fc-silent mutants. These antibody products are stable, retain their antigen specificity, and display their intrinsic Fc-effector functions in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we can site-specifically attach cargo to these antibody products via chemoenzymatic modification. We believe that this versatile platform facilitates antibody engineering for the entire scientific community, empowering preclinical antibody research.

31488582	Protein and membrane trafficking pathways are critical for cell and tissue homeostasis. Traditional genetic and biochemical approaches have shed light on basic principles underlying these processes. However, the list of factors required for secretory pathway function remains incomplete, and mechanisms involved in their adaptation poorly understood. Here, we present a powerful strategy based on a pooled genome-wide CRISPRi screen that allowed the identification of new factors involved in protein transport. Two newly identified factors, TTC17 and CCDC157, localized along the secretory pathway and were found to interact with resident proteins of ER-Golgi membranes. In addition, we uncovered that upon TTC17 knockdown, the polarized organization of Golgi cisternae was altered, creating glycosylation defects, and that CCDC157 is an important factor for the fusion of transport carriers to Golgi membranes. In conclusion, our work identified and characterized new actors in the mechanisms of protein transport and secretion and opens stimulating perspectives for the use of our platform in physiological and pathological contexts.

31481656	Genome-wide CRISPR screening is a powerful tool to identify genes required under selective conditions. However, the inherent scale of genome-wide libraries can limit their application in experimental settings where cell numbers are restricted, such as in vivo infections or single cell analysis. The use of small scale CRISPR libraries targeting gene subsets circumvents this problem. Here we develop a method for rapid generation of custom guide RNA (gRNA) libraries using arrayed single-stranded oligonucleotides for reproducible pooled cloning of CRISPR/Cas9 libraries. We use this system to generate mutant pools of different sizes in the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondi and describe optimised analysis methods for small scale libraries. An in vivo genetic screen in the murine host identifies novel and known virulence factors and we confirm results using cloned knock-out parasites. Our study also reveals a potential trans-rescue of individual knock-out parasites in pools of mutants compared to homogenous knock-out lines of the key virulence factor MYR1.

31451697	Transcriptional regulation by nuclease-deficient CRISPR/Cas is a popular and valuable tool for routine control of gene expression. CRISPR interference in bacteria can be reliably achieved with high efficiencies. Yet, options for CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) remained limited in flexibility and activity because they relied on σ70 promoters. Here we report a eukaryote-like bacterial CRISPRa system based on σ54-dependent promoters, which supports long distance, and hence multi-input regulation with high dynamic ranges. Our CRISPRa device can activate σ54-dependent promoters with biotechnology relevance in non-model bacteria. It also supports orthogonal gene regulation on multiple levels. Combining our CRISPRa with dxCas9 further expands flexibility in DNA targeting, and boosts dynamic ranges into regimes that enable construction of cascaded CRISPRa circuits. Application-wise, we construct a reusable scanning platform for readily optimizing metabolic pathways without library reconstructions. This eukaryote-like CRISPRa system is therefore a powerful and versatile synthetic biology tool for diverse research and industrial applications.	Y Liu|X Wan|B Wang
31451604	Genetically modified mice have become standard tools in neuroscience research. Our understanding of the basal ganglia in particular has been greatly assisted by BAC mutants with selective transgene expression in striatal neurons forming the direct or indirect pathways. However, for more sophisticated behavioral tasks and larger intracranial implants, rat models are preferred. Furthermore, BAC lines can show variable expression patterns depending upon genomic insertion site. We therefore used CRISPR/Cas9 to generate two novel knock-in rat lines specifically encoding Cre recombinase immediately after the dopamine D1 receptor (Drd1a) or adenosine 2a receptor (Adora2a) loci. Here, we validate these lines using in situ hybridization and viral vector mediated transfection to demonstrate selective, functional Cre expression in the striatal direct and indirect pathways, respectively. We used whole-genome sequencing to confirm the lack of off-target effects and established that both rat lines have normal locomotor activity and learning in simple instrumental and Pavlovian tasks. We expect these new D1-Cre and A2a-Cre rat lines will be widely used to study both normal brain functions and neurological and psychiatric pathophysiology.

31446002	Sperm preservation is a useful technique for maintaining valuable animal strains. Rat sperm could be frozen or freeze-dried in a simple Tris-EDTA solution (TE buffer), and oocytes that were fertilized with these sperm by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) developed into offspring. Genome editing with the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) system enables the rapid production of genetically modified rats. The recent innovative method, named the TAKE method, could easily produce genome edited rats by electroporation of endonucleases into embryos. Although various rat strains have been applied for genome editing, genome editing using strains that were preserved as sperm took longer because it required collecting embryos after maturation of animals regenerated from sperm. To reduce the production period, we directly electroporated Cas9 protein and gRNA into oocytes that were injected with frozen or freeze-dried sperm in TE buffer. No effect of electroporation until 30 V to ICSI-embryos derived from frozen or freeze-dried sperm were shown in the development of offspring. Furthermore, the rate of genome editing in offspring was high (56% for frozen and 50% for freeze-dried sperm). These results concluded that the combination of ICSI and the TAKE method was useful for the rapid production of genome-edited animals from sperm that have been preserved as genetic resources.

31442407	CD8 T cells play essential roles in anti-tumor immune responses. Here, we performed genome-scale CRISPR screens in CD8 T cells directly under cancer immunotherapy settings and identified regulators of tumor infiltration and degranulation. The in vivo screen robustly re-identified canonical immunotherapy targets such as PD-1 and Tim-3, along with genes that have not been characterized in T cells. The infiltration and degranulation screens converged on an RNA helicase Dhx37. Dhx37 knockout enhanced the efficacy of antigen-specific CD8 T cells against triple-negative breast cancer in vivo. Immunological characterization in mouse and human CD8 T cells revealed that DHX37 suppresses effector functions, cytokine production, and T cell activation. Transcriptomic profiling and biochemical interrogation revealed a role for DHX37 in modulating NF-κB. These data demonstrate high-throughput in vivo genetic screens for immunotherapy target discovery and establishes DHX37 as a functional regulator of CD8 T cells.

The novel gene editing technology focuses on the field of artificial nuclease cleavage technology, mainly ZFN technology, TALEN technology, CRISPR technology and base editing technology. The continuous improvement of gene editing technology has promoted the rapid development of agriculture, animal husbandry and biomedicine, but at the same time, technical defects and ethical controversy have brought enormous challenges to its own development.

31439014	Chemogenetic profiling enables the identification of gene mutations that enhance or suppress the activity of chemical compounds. This knowledge provides insights into drug mechanism of action, genetic vulnerabilities, and resistance mechanisms, all of which may help stratify patient populations and improve drug efficacy. CRISPR-based screening enables sensitive detection of drug-gene interactions directly in human cells, but until recently has primarily been used to screen only for resistance mechanisms.	We present drugZ, an algorithm for identifying both synergistic and suppressor chemogenetic interactions from CRISPR screens. DrugZ identifies synthetic lethal interactions between PARP inhibitors and both known and novel members of the DNA damage repair pathway, confirms KEAP1 loss as a resistance factor for ERK inhibitors in oncogenic KRAS backgrounds, and defines the genetic context for temozolomide activity.	DrugZ is an open-source Python software for the analysis of genome-scale drug modifier screens. The software accurately identifies genetic perturbations that enhance or suppress drug activity.

31434578	Pichia pastoris (syn. Komagataella phaffii) is a widely used generally recognized as safe host for heterologous expression of proteins in both industry and academia. Recently, it has been shown to be a potentially good chassis host for the production of high-value pharmaceuticals and chemicals. Nevertheless, limited availability of selective markers and low efficiency of homologous recombination make this process difficult and time-consuming, particularly in the case of multistep biosynthetic pathways. Therefore, it is crucial to develop an efficient and marker-free multiloci gene knock-in method in P. pastoris.	A non-homologous-end-joining defective strain (Δku70) was first constructed using the CRISPR-Cas9 based gene deficiency approach. It was then used as a parent strain for multiloci gene integration. Ten guide RNA (gRNA) targets were designed within 100 bp upstream of the promoters or downstream of terminator, and then tested using an eGFP reporter and confirmed as suitable single-locus integration sites. Three high-efficiency gRNA targets (PAOX1UP-g2, PTEF1UP-g1, and PFLD1UP-g1) were selected for double- and triple-locus co-integration. The integration efficiency ranged from 57.7 to 70% and 12.5 to 32.1% for double-locus and triple-locus integration, respectively. In addition, biosynthetic pathways of 6-methylsalicylic acid and 3-methylcatechol were successfully assembled using the developed method by one-step integration of functional genes. The desired products were obtained, which further established the effectiveness and applicability of the developed CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene co-integration method in P. pastoris.	A CRISPR-Cas9-mediated multiloci gene integration method was developed with efficient gRNA targets in P. pastoris. Using this method, multiple gene cassettes can be simultaneously integrated into the genome without employing selective markers. The multiloci integration strategy is beneficial for pathway assembly of complicated pharmaceuticals and chemicals expressed in P. pastoris.	Q Liu|X Shi|L Song|H Liu|X Zhou|Q Wang|Y Zhang|M Cai

31433273	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated genes (Cas) is a prokaryotic adaptive immune system which has been reprogrammed into a precise, simple, and efficient gene targeting technology. This emerging technology is revolutionizing various areas of life sciences, medicine, and biotechnology and has raised significant interest among plant biologists, both in basic science and in plant protection and breeding. In this review, we describe the basic principles of CRISPR/Cas systems, and how they can be deployed to model plants and crops for the control, monitoring, and study of the mechanistic aspects of plant virus infections. We discuss how Cas endonucleases can be used to engineer plant virus resistance by directly targeting viral DNA or RNA, as well as how they can inactivate host susceptibility genes. Additionally, other applications of CRISPR/Cas in plant virology such as virus diagnostics and imaging are reviewed. The review also provides a systemic comparison between CRISPR/Cas technology and RNA interference approaches, the latter of which has also been used for development of virus-resistant plants. Finally, we outline challenges to be solved before CRISPR/Cas can produce virus-resistant crop plants which can be marketed.	NO Kalinina|A Khromov|AJ Love|ME Taliansky
31427773	We report a new immunodeficiency disorder in mice caused by a viable hypomorphic mutation of Snrnp40, an essential gene encoding a subunit of the U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex of the spliceosome. Snrnp40 is ubiquitous but strongly expressed in lymphoid tissue. Homozygous mutant mice showed hypersusceptibility to infection by murine cytomegalovirus and multiple defects of lymphoid development, stability and function. Cell-intrinsic defects of hematopoietic stem cell differentiation also affected homozygous mutants. SNRNP40 deficiency in primary hematopoietic stem cells or T cells or the EL4 cell line increased the frequency of splicing errors, mostly intron retention, in several hundred messenger RNAs. Altered expression of proteins associated with immune cell function was also observed in Snrnp40-mutant cells. The immunological consequences of SNRNP40 deficiency presumably result from cumulative, moderate effects on processing of many different mRNA molecules and secondary reductions in the expression of critical immune proteins, yielding a syndromic immune disorder.

31427601	Discovery of CRISPR-Cas systems is one of paramount importance in the field of microbiology. Currently, how CRISPR-Cas systems are finely regulated remains to be defined. Here we use small regulatory RNA (sRNA) library to screen sRNAs targeting type I-F CRISPR-Cas system through proximity ligation by T4 RNA ligase and find 34 sRNAs linking to CRISPR loci. Among 34 sRNAs for potential regulators of CRISPR, sRNA pant463 and PhrS enhance CRISPR loci transcription, while pant391 represses their transcription. We identify PhrS as a regulator of CRISPR-Cas by binding CRISPR leaders to suppress Rho-dependent transcription termination. PhrS-mediated anti-termination facilitates CRISPR locus transcription to generate CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and subsequently promotes CRISPR-Cas adaptive immunity against bacteriophage invasion. Furthermore, this also exists in type I-C/-E CRISPR-Cas, suggesting general regulatory mechanisms in bacteria kingdom. Our findings identify sRNAs as important regulators of CRISPR-Cas, extending roles of sRNAs in controlling bacterial physiology by promoting CRISPR-Cas adaptation priming.

31406371	The CRISPR-Cpf1 endonuclease has recently been demonstrated as a powerful tool to manipulate targeted gene sequences. Here, we performed an extensive screening of split Cpf1 fragments and identified a pair that, combined with inducible dimerization domains, enables chemical- and light-inducible genome editing in human cells. We also identified another split Cpf1 pair that is spontaneously activated. The newly generated amino and carboxyl termini of the spontaneously activated split Cpf1 can be repurposed as de novo fusion sites of artificial effector domains. Based on this finding, we generated an improved split dCpf1 activator, which has the potential to activate endogenous genes more efficiently than a previously established dCas9 activator. Finally, we showed that the split dCpf1 activator can efficiently activate target genes in mice. These results demonstrate that the present split Cpf1 provides an efficient and sophisticated genome manipulation in the fields of basic research and biotechnological applications.

31394408	The Coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) is both a viral receptor and cell adhesion protein. CAR has two transmembrane isoforms that localize distinctly in polarized epithelial cells. Whereas the seven exon-encoded isoform (CAREx7) exhibits basolateral localization, the eight exon-encoded isoform (CAREx8) can localize to the apical epithelial surface where it can mediate luminal adenovirus infection. To further understand the distinct biological functions of these two isoforms, CRISPR/Cas9 genomic editing was used to specifically delete the eighth exon of the CXADR gene in a Madine Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cell line with a stably integrated lentiviral doxycycline-inducible CAREx8 cDNA. The gene-edited clone demonstrated a significant reduction in adenovirus susceptibility when both partially and fully polarized, and doxycycline-induction of CAREx8 restored sensitivity to adenovirus. These data reinforce the importance of CAREx8 in apical adenovirus infection and provide a new model cell line to probe isoform specific biological functions of CAR.

31392987	The CRISPR system provides adaptive immunity against mobile genetic elements (MGE) in prokaryotes. In type III CRISPR systems, an effector complex programmed by CRISPR RNA detects invading RNA, triggering a multi-layered defence that includes target RNA cleavage, licencing of an HD DNA nuclease domain and synthesis of cyclic oligoadenylate (cOA) molecules. cOA activates the Csx1/Csm6 family of effectors, which degrade RNA non-specifically to enhance immunity. Type III systems are found in diverse archaea and bacteria, including the human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Here, we report a comprehensive analysis of the in vitro and in vivo activities of the type III-A M. tuberculosis CRISPR system. We demonstrate that immunity against MGE may be achieved predominantly via a cyclic hexa-adenylate (cA6) signalling pathway and the ribonuclease Csm6, rather than through DNA cleavage by the HD domain. Furthermore, we show for the first time that a type III CRISPR system can be reprogrammed by replacing the effector protein, which may be relevant for maintenance of immunity in response to pressure from viral anti-CRISPRs. These observations demonstrate that M. tuberculosis has a fully-functioning CRISPR interference system that generates a range of cyclic and linear oligonucleotides of known and unknown functions, potentiating fundamental and applied studies.

31391371	Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains a devasting disease. Progress has been made to define molecular mechanisms underlying disease pathogenesis due, in part, to the near-complete understanding of AML genome. Nonetheless, functional studies are necessary to assess the significance of AML-associated mutations and devise urgently needed therapies. Genome-wide knockout screening, employing CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, is a powerful tool in functional genomics. In this study, genome-wide CRISPR screening was performed using mouse leukemia cell lines developed in our Center, followed by in vivo screening. Among 20,611 genes, 130 AML essential genes were identified, including clinically actionable candidates. It was shown that mRNA decapping enzyme scavenger (DCPS), an enzyme implicated in mRNA decay pathway, is essential for AML survival. ShRNA-mediated gene knockdown and DCPS inhibitor (RG3039) were employed to validate findings. RG3039 induced cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in vitro. Furthermore, mass spectrometry analysis revealed an association between DCPS and RNA metabolic pathways, and RNA-Seq showed that RG3039 treatment induced aberrant mRNA splicing in AML cells. Importantly, RG3039 exhibited anti-leukemia effects in PDX models. These findings identify DCPS as a novel therapeutic target for AML, shedding new light on the nuclear RNA metabolic pathway in leukemogenesis.	T Yamauchi
31389773	This is a review describing advances in CRISPR/Cas-mediated therapies for neuromuscular disorders (NMDs).

31387837	Microalgae and cyanobacteria are easy to culture, with higher growth rates and photosynthetic efficiencies compared to terrestrial plants, and thus generating higher productivity. The concept of microalgal biorefinery is to assimilate carbon dioxide and convert it to chemical energy/value-added products, such as vitamins, carotenoids, fatty acids, proteins and nucleic acids, to be applied in bioenergy, health foods, aquaculture feed, pharmaceutical and medical fields. Therefore, microalgae are annotated as the third generation feedstock in bioenergy and biorefinery. In past decades, many studies thrived to improve the carbon sequestration efficiency as well as enhance value-added compounds from different algae, especially via genetic engineering, synthetic biology, metabolic design and regulation. From the traditional Agrobacterium-mediated transformation DNA to novel CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) technology applied in microalgae and cyanobacteria, this review has highlighted the genome editing technology for biorefinery that is a highly environmental friendly trend to sustainable and renewable development.

31385197	The class 2 clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas system, one of the prokaryotic adaptive immune systems, has sparked a lot of attention for its use as a gene editing tool. Currently, type II, V, and VI effector modules of this class have been characterized and extensively tested for nucleic acid editing, imaging, and disease diagnostics. Due to the unique composition of their nuclease catalytic center, the effector modules substantially vary in their function and possible biotechnology applications. In this review, we discuss the structural and functional diversity in class 2 CRISPR effectors, and debate their suitability for nucleic acid targeting and their shortcomings as gene editing tools.

31376419	The eukaryotic genome is compacted in the form of chromatin within the nucleus. Whether the spatial distribution of the genome is ordered or not has been a longstanding question. Answering this question would enable us to understand nuclear organization and cellular processes more deeply. Here, we applied a modified CRISPR/dCas9 system to label the randomly selected genomic loci in diploid living cells, which were visualized by high-resolution wide-field imaging. To analyze the spatial positions of three pairs of genomic loci, three sets of parameters were progressively measured: i) the linear distance between alleles; ii) the radial distribution of the genomic loci; and iii) the linear distances between three pairs of genomic loci on nonhomologous chromosomes. By accurate labeling, geometric measuring and statistical analysis, we demonstrated that the distribution of these genomic loci in the 3D space of the nucleus is relatively stable in both late G1 and early S phases. Collectively, our data provided visual evidence in live cells, which implies the orderly spatial organization of chromatin in the nucleus. The combination of orderliness and flexibility ensures the methodical and efficient operation of complex life systems. How the nucleus adopts this ordered 3D structure in living cells is thought-provoking.	DG Guo|DB Wang|C Liu|S Lu|Y Hou|XE Zhang
31375138	We describe a method that adds long-read sequencing to a mix of technologies used to assemble a highly complex cattle rumen microbial community, and provide a comparison to short read-based methods. Long-read alignments and Hi-C linkage between contigs support the identification of 188 novel virus-host associations and the determination of phage life cycle states in the rumen microbial community. The long-read assembly also identifies 94 antimicrobial resistance genes, compared to only seven alleles in the short-read assembly. We demonstrate novel techniques that work synergistically to improve characterization of biological features in a highly complex rumen microbial community.

31367015	Mutations in gene regulatory elements have been associated with a wide range of complex neuropsychiatric disorders. However, due to their cell-type specificity and difficulties in characterizing their regulatory targets, the ability to identify causal genetic variants has remained limited. To address these constraints, we perform an integrative analysis of chromatin interactions, open chromatin regions and transcriptomes using promoter capture Hi-C, assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) and RNA sequencing, respectively, in four functionally distinct neural cell types: induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-induced excitatory neurons and lower motor neurons, iPSC-derived hippocampal dentate gyrus-like neurons and primary astrocytes. We identify hundreds of thousands of long-range cis-interactions between promoters and distal promoter-interacting regions, enabling us to link regulatory elements to their target genes and reveal putative processes that are dysregulated in disease. Finally, we validate several promoter-interacting regions by using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) techniques in human excitatory neurons, demonstrating that CDK5RAP3, STRAP and DRD2 are transcriptionally regulated by physically linked enhancers.

31363085	Precise editing of genomic DNA can be achieved upon repair of CRISPR-induced DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs) by homology-directed repair (HDR). However, the efficiency of this process is limited by DSB repair pathways competing with HDR, such as non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). Here we individually express in human cells 204 open reading frames involved in the DNA damage response (DDR) and determine their impact on CRISPR-mediated HDR. From these studies, we identify RAD18 as a stimulator of CRISPR-mediated HDR. By defining the RAD18 domains required to promote HDR, we derive an enhanced RAD18 variant (e18) that stimulates CRISPR-mediated HDR in multiple human cell types, including embryonic stem cells. Mechanistically, e18 induces HDR by suppressing the localization of the NHEJ-promoting factor 53BP1 to DSBs. Altogether, this study identifies e18 as an enhancer of CRISPR-mediated HDR and highlights the promise of engineering DDR factors to augment the efficiency of precision genome editing.

31360106	DNA sequences drive their various functions through post-transcriptional processes, using mRNA or lncRNA (long non-coding RNA), and this accommodates the gene network by using various RNA types. However, the tools necessary to regulate RNA molecules are few. Likewise, RNA knockdown techniques that can be artificially controlled have not been extensively explored. Here, we investigated a novel light-inducible synthetic system based on CRISPR-Cas13a that can be used for RNA knockdown and binding in cancer cells. Based on the techniques of synthetic molecular biology, we constructed a light sensor, which efficiently induced Cas13a protein expression after blue light illumination. We also chose a lncRNA, Metastasis-associated Lung Adenocarcinoma Transcript 1 (MALAT1), as the functional target and detected it in bladder cancer 5637 and T24 cells in order to demonstrate the application of our synthetic system. Fluorescence reporter assays and real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) were used to detect the expression of the target gene. Phenotypic experiments were also used to test the effects of our synthetic system in bladder cancers. The results showed that our synthetic light-switchable system could inhibit the expression of MALAT1, and the fluorescence activity of enhanced green fluorescent protein. Our novel system provides a new technique to study RNA functions in gene networks and for precise tumor treatments.	F Qi|B Tan|F Ma|B Zhu|L Zhang|X Liu|H Li|J Yang|B Cheng
31360104	Fatty acid synthesis is regulated by transcription factors SREBPs and their escort protein SCAP. Malignant cells become dependent on de novo lipogenesis, which sustains rapid proliferation and resistance to cellular stress. Increasing evidence showed SCAP participated in various disease processes including malignant tumors, which regulate transcription factors SREBPs Tumorigenesis is associated with incur glucose consumption and lipogenesis. In our study, we discovered that SCAP was upregulated in BC tissues. SCAP knockdown by CRISPR-Cas9 inhibit the cell proliferation, invasion and migration. Additionally, the cell apoptosis was facilitated. What's more, downregulation of SCAP could weaken the cancer-promoting effects of estrogen on BC. Our study revealed that SCAP played a carcinogenic role in BC and lipogenesis might promote the initiation of BC by inducing SCAP. Thus, Targeting SCAP may provide a promising means of treating BC and a new perspective for the tumorigenesis of bladder cancer.	A Li|L Yao|Y Fang|K Yang|W Jiang|W Huang|Z Cai
31359043	Cytokinins are involved in the regulation of many plant growth and development processes, and function in response to abiotic stress. Cytokinin signaling is similar to the prokaryotic two-component signaling systems and includes the transcriptional upregulation of type-A response regulators (RRs), which in turn act to inhibit cytokinin signal response via negative feedback. Cytokinin signaling consists of several gene families and only a handful full of genes is studied. In this study, we demonstrated the function of two highly identical type-A RR genes from rice, OsRR9 and OsRR10, which are induced by cytokinin and only OsRR10 repressed by salinity stress in rice. Loss-of-function mutations give rise to mutant genes, osrr9/osrr10, which have higher salinity tolerance than wild type rice seedlings. The transcriptomic analysis uncovered several ion transporter genes, which were upregulated in response to salt stress in the osrr9/osrr10 mutants relative to the wild type seedlings. These include high-affinity potassium transporters, such as OsHKT1;1, OsHKT1;3 and OsHKT2;1, which play an important role in sodium and potassium homeostasis. In addition, disruption of the genes OsRR9 and OsRR10 also affects the expression of multiple genes related to photosynthesis, transcription and phytohormone signaling. Taken together, these results suggest that the genes OsRR9 and OsRR10 function as negative regulators in response to salinity in rice.	WC Wang|TC Lin|J Kieber|YC Tsai

31347199	The CRISPR-Cas (clustered regular interspaced short palindromic repeats and CRISPR-associated proteins) system is a newly discovered immune defense system in the genome of prokaryotes, which can resist the invasion of foreign genetic elements, such as plasmids or phage. In this study, 154 strains of Staphylococcus published in the CRISPRDatabase and 171 strains included in NCBI were downloaded, the confirmed and questionable CRISPR loci of which were analyzed by bioinformatics methods, including their distribution, characteristics of the structure (including the direct repeats, spacers and cas genes), and the relationship between the presence of CRISPR and the mecA gene. Meanwhile, a comprehensive analysis of orphan CRISPR arrays was performed on this basis. A total of 196 confirmed and 1757 questionable CRISPR loci were found in 325 Staphylococcus genomes. Only 25 strains contained cas genes, which were classified into III-A (48.1%) and II-C (51.9%). The difference between the presence of the cas gene and the carrying rate of mecA was statistically significant, and they were negatively correlated. A total of 137 confirmed and 1755 questionable CRISPR loci were assumed to be false-CRISPR. The present study also analyzed the questionable CRISPR array for the first time while analyzing the confirmed CRISPR array in the Staphylococcal genome and screened the false-CRISPR elements in the orphan CRISPR array.

31334871	Ligamentum flavum hypertrophy (LFH) is the most important component of lumbar spinal canal stenosis. Although the pathophysiology of LFH has been extensively studied, no method has been proposed to prevent or treat it. Since the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) pathway is known to be critical in LFH pathology, we investigated whether LFH could be prevented by blocking or modulating the TGF-β mechanism. Human LF cells were used for the experiments. First, we created TGF-β receptor 1 (TGFBR1) knock out (KO) cells with CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas9 biotechnology and treated them with TGF-β1 to determine the effects of blocking the TGF-β pathway. Subsequently, we studied the effect of CCN5, which has recently been proposed to modulate the TGF-β pathway. To assess the predisposition toward fibrosis, α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA), fibronectin, collagen-1, collagen-3, and CCN2 were evaluated with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, and immunocytochemistry. The TGFBR1 KO LF cells were successfully constructed with high KO efficiency. In wild-type (WT) cells, treatment with TGF-β1 resulted in the overexpression of the messenger RNA (mRNA) of fibrosis-related factors. However, in KO cells, the responses to TGF-β1 stimulation were significantly lower. In addition, CCN5 and TGF-β1 co-treatment caused a notable reduction in mRNA expression levels compared with TGF-β1 stimulation only. The αSMA protein expression increased with TGF-β1 but decreased with CCN5 treatment. TGF-β1 induced LF cell transdifferentiation from fibroblasts to myofibroblasts. However, this cell transition dramatically decreased in the presence of CCN5. In conclusion, CCN5 could prevent LFH by modulating the TGF-β pathway. © 2019 The Authors.

31320398	The ability to control transcription in a time-dependent manner in vitro promises numerous applications in molecular biology and nanotechnology. Here we demonstrate an approach that enables precise, independent control over the production of multiple RNA transcripts in vitro using single guide RNA (sgRNA)-directed transcription blockades by catalytically dead Streptococcus pyogenes CRISPR-Cas9 enzyme (dCas9). We show that when bound to a DNA template, the dCas9:sgRNA complex forms a robust blockade to transcription by RNA polymerases (RNAPs) from bacteriophages SP6, T3, and T7 (>99.5% efficiency), and a partial blockade to transcription by Escherichia coli RNAP (∼70% efficiency). We find that all three bacteriophage RNAPs dissociate from the DNA template upon encountering the dCas9 blockade, while E. coli RNAP stays bound for at least the 90-min duration of our experiments. The blockade maintains >95% efficiency when four mismatches are introduced into the 5' end of the sgRNA target sequence. Notably, when using such a mismatched blockade, production of specific RNA species can be activated on demand by addition of a double-stranded competitor DNA perfectly matching the sgRNA. This strategy enables the independent production of multiple RNA species in a temporally controlled fashion from the same DNA template, demonstrating a new approach for transcription control.

31316073	Capitalizing on the inherent multiplexing capability of AsCpf1, we developed a multiplexed, high-throughput screening strategy that minimizes library size without sacrificing gene targeting efficiency. We demonstrated that AsCpf1 can be used for functional genomics screenings and that an AsCpf1-based multiplexed library performs similarly as compared to currently available monocistronic CRISPR/Cas9 libraries, with only one vector required for each gene. We construct the smallest whole-genome CRISPR knock-out library, Mini-human, for the human genome (n = 17,032 constructs targeting 16,977 protein-coding genes), which performs favorably compared to conventional Cas9 libraries.

31315144	Natural killer cells are potent cytotoxic lymphocytes specialized in recognizing and eliminating transformed cells, and in orchestrating adaptive anti-tumour immunity. However, NK cells are usually functionally exhausted in the tumour microenvironment. Strategies such as checkpoint blockades are under investigation to overcome NK cell exhaustion in order to boost anti-tumour immunity. The discovery and development of the CRISPR/Cas9 technology offer a flexible and efficient gene-editing capability in modulating various pathways that mediate NK cell exhaustion, and in arming NK cells with novel chimeric antigen receptors to specifically target tumour cells. Despite the high efficiency in its gene-editing capability, difficulty in the delivery of the CRISPR/Cas9 system remains a major bottleneck for its therapeutic applications, particularly for NK cells. The current review discusses feasible approaches to deliver the CRISPR/Cas9 systems, as well as potential strategies in gene-editing for NK cell immunotherapy for cancers.

31315026	Estrogen related receptor beta (Esrrb) is an orphan nuclear receptor that is required for self-renewal and pluripotency in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. However, in the early post-implantation mouse embryo, Esrrb is specifically expressed in the extraembryonic ectoderm (ExE) and plays a crucial role in trophoblast development. Previous studies showed that Esrrb is also required to maintain trophoblast stem (TS) cells, the in vitro stem cell model of the early trophoblast lineage. In order to identify regulatory targets of Esrrb in vivo, we performed microarray analysis of Esrrb-null versus wild-type post-implantation ExE, and identified 30 genes down-regulated in Esrrb-mutants. Among them is Bmp4, which is produced by the ExE and known to be critical for primordial germ cell (PGC) specification in vivo. We further identified an enhancer region bound by Esrrb at the Bmp4 locus by performing Esrrb ChIP-seq and luciferase reporter assay using TS cells. Finally, we established a knockout mouse line in which the enhancer region was deleted using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Both Esrrb-null embryos and enhancer knockout embryos expressed lower levels of Bmp4 in the ExE, and had reduced numbers of PGCs. These results suggested that Esrrb functions as an upstream factor of Bmp4 in the ExE, regulating proper PGC development in mice.	E Okamura|OH Tam|E Posfai|L Li|K Cockburn|CQE Lee|J Garner|J Rossant

31313011	In the ongoing discussion about the risks of reproductive human germline modification, scant attention has been paid to whether it could be reconciled with theories of psychological well-being. Even if safety and feasibility challenges could be overcome and germline engineering technology could be implemented in ways that avoid exacerbating social inequality, we would still have to question whether germline modification would promote circumstances that lead to better psychological experiences for parents, society, and the genetically edited person. This paper posits that germline engineering would produce expectations of being able to control the manifestation of an individual's characteristics, which will inevitably be upset by our limited understanding of how genes interact with each other and with the environment. Drawing on self-discrepancy and relative deprivation theories, it is suggested that both editing and being edited could lead to unmet expectations and thus negative emotional states that would offset benefits of successful intended genetic changes.

However, systematic identification of these relationships is complicated by sample, reagent, and biological variability. We develop a variational Bayes approach (GEMINI) that jointly analyzes all samples and reagents to identify genetic interactions in pairwise knockout screens. The improved accuracy and scalability of GEMINI enables the systematic analysis of combinatorial CRISPR knockout screens, regardless of design and dimension.

31295471	Till date, only three techniques namely Zinc Finger Nuclease (ZFN), Transcription-Activator Like Effector Nucleases (TALEN) and Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats-CRISPR-Associated 9 (CRISPR-Cas9) are available for targeted genome editing. CRISPR-Cas system is very efficient, fast, easy and cheap technique for achieving knock-out gene in the cell. CRISPR-Cas9 system refurbishes the targeted genome editing approach into a more expedient and competent way, thus facilitating proficient genome editing through embattled double-strand breaks in approximately any organism and cell type. The off-target effects of CRISPR Cas system has been circumnavigated by using paired nickases. Moreover, CRISPR-Cas9 has been used effectively for numerous purposes, like knock-out of a gene, regulation of endogenous gene expression, live-cell labelling of chromosomal loci, edition of single-stranded RNA and high-throughput gene screening. The execution of the CRISPR-Cas9 system has amplified the number of accessible scientific substitutes for studying gene function, thus enabling generation of CRISPR-based disease models. Even though many mechanistic questions are left behind to be answered and the system is not yet fool-proof i.e., a number of challenges are yet to be addressed, the employment of CRISPR-Cas9-based genome engineering technologies will increase our understanding to disease processes and their treatment in the near future. In this review we have discussed the history of CRISPR-Cas9, its mechanism for genome editing and its application in animal, plant and protozoan parasites. Additionally, the pros and cons of CRISPR-Cas9 and its potential in therapeutic application have also been detailed here.

31288753	Sequencing of microbiomes has accelerated the characterization of the diversity of CRISPR-Cas immune systems. However, the utilization of next generation short read sequences for the characterization of CRISPR-Cas dynamics remains limited due to the repetitive nature of CRISPR arrays. CRISPR arrays are comprised of short spacer segments (derived from invaders' genomes) interspaced between flanking repeat sequences. The repetitive structure of CRISPR arrays poses a computational challenge for the accurate assembly of CRISPR arrays from short reads. In this paper we evaluate the use of long read sequences for the analysis of CRISPR-Cas system dynamics in microbiomes.	We analyzed a dataset of Illumina's TruSeq Synthetic Long-Reads (SLR) derived from a gut microbiome. We showed that long reads captured CRISPR spacers at a high degree of redundancy, which highlights the spacer conservation of spacer sharing CRISPR variants, enabling the study of CRISPR array dynamics in ways difficult to achieve though short read sequences. We introduce compressed spacer graphs, a visual abstraction of spacer sharing CRISPR arrays, to provide a simplified view of complex organizational structures present within CRISPR array dynamics. Utilizing compressed spacer graphs, several key defining characteristics of CRISPR-Cas system dynamics were observed including spacer acquisition and loss events, conservation of the trailer end spacers, and CRISPR arrays' directionality (transcription orientation). Other result highlights include the observation of intense array contraction and expansion events, and reconstruction of a full-length genome for a potential invader (Faecalibacterium phage) based on identified spacers.	We demonstrate in an in silico system that long reads provide the necessary context for characterizing the organization of CRISPR arrays in a microbiome, and reveal dynamic and evolutionary features of CRISPR-Cas systems in a microbial population.

31284938	Citrus crops have great economic importance worldwide. However, citrus production faces many diseases caused by different pathogens, such as bacteria, oomycetes, fungi and viruses. To overcome important plant diseases in general, new technologies have been developed and applied to crop protection, including RNA interference (RNAi) and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) systems. RNAi has been demonstrated to be a powerful tool for application in plant defence mechanisms against different pathogens as well as their respective vectors, and CRISPR/Cas system has become widely used in gene editing or reprogramming or knocking out any chosen DNA/RNA sequence. In this article, we provide an overview of the use of RNAi and CRISPR/Cas technologies in management strategies to control several plants diseases, and we discuss how these strategies can be potentially used against citrus pathogens.

31280424	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) immune systems in bacteria have been used as tools for genome engineering. Thus far, the CRISPR-Cas system has been used in various yeast, bacterial, and mammalian cells. Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a nonpathogenic yeast, classified under "generally recognized as safe", and has long been used to produce consumables such as alcohol or bread. Additionally, recombinant cells of S. cerevisiae have been constructed and used to produce various bio-based chemicals. Some types of CRISPR-Cas system for genetic manipulation have been constructed during the early developmental stages of the CRISPR-Cas system and have been mainly used for gene knock-in and knock-out manipulations. Thereafter, these systems have been used for various novel purposes such as metabolic engineering and tolerance engineering. In this review, we have summarized different aspects of the CRISPR-Cas in the yeast S. cerevisiae, from its basic principles to various applications. This review describes the CRISPR system in S. cerevisiae based on the differences in its origin and efficiency followed by its basic applications; for example, its involvement in gene knock-in and knock-out has been outlined. Finally, advanced applications of the CRISPR system in the bioproduction of useful chemicals have been summarized.	R Mitsui|R Yamada|H Ogino
31279547	Streptococcus thermophilus is a lactic acid bacterium widely used in the syntrophic fermentation of milk into yogurt and cheese. Streptococcus thermophilus has adapted to ferment milk primarily through reductive genome evolution but also through acquisition of genes conferring proto-cooperation with Lactobacillus bulgaricus and efficient metabolism of milk macronutrients. Genomic analysis of Strep. thermophilus strains suggests that mobile genetic elements have contributed to genomic evolution through horizontal gene transfer and genomic plasticity. We previously used the endogenous type II CRISPR-Cas [clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) with CRISPR-associated sequences (Cas)] system in Strep. thermophilus to isolate derivatives lacking the chromosomal mobile genetic element and expandable island that display decreased fitness under routine culturing conditions. Of note, the Lac operon and Leloir pathway genes were deleted in the largest expendable genomic island (102 kbp), rendering the strain incapable of acidifying milk. However, the removal of other open reading frames in the same island had unclear effects on the fitness and regulatory networks of Strep. thermophilus. To uncover the physiological basis for the observed phenotypic changes and underlying regulatory networks affected by deletion of the 102-kbp genomic island in Strep. thermophilus, we analyzed the transcriptome of the mutant that lacked ∼5% of its genome. In addition to the loss of transcripts encoded by the deleted material, we detected a total of 56 genes that were differentially expressed, primarily encompassing 10 select operons. Several predicted metabolic pathways were affected, including amino acid and purine metabolism, oligopeptide transport, and iron transport. Collectively, these results suggest that deletion of a 102-kb genomic island in Strep. thermophilus influences compensatory transcription of starvation stress response genes and metabolic pathways involved in important niche-related adaptation.

31279087	Quorum sensing (QS) is a molecular communication system that bacteria use to harmonize the regulation of genes in a cell density-dependent manner. In proteobacteria, QS is involved, among others, in virulence, biofilm formation or CRISPR-Cas gene regulation. Here, we report for the first time the effect of a QS-interfering enzyme to alter the regulation of CRISPR-Cas systems in model and clinical strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as in the marine bacterium Chromobacterium violaceum CV12472. The expression of CRISPR-Cas genes decreased in most cases suggesting that enzymatic disruption of QS is promising for modulating phage-bacteria interactions.

31278272	Type III-A CRISPR-Cas systems are prokaryotic RNA-guided adaptive immune systems that use a protein-RNA complex, Csm, for transcription-dependent immunity against foreign DNA. Csm can cleave RNA and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), but whether it targets one or both nucleic acids during transcription elongation is unknown. Here, we show that binding of a Thermus thermophilus (T. thermophilus) Csm (TthCsm) to a nascent transcript in a transcription elongation complex (TEC) promotes tethering but not direct contact of TthCsm with RNA polymerase (RNAP). Biochemical experiments show that both TthCsm and Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis) Csm (SepCsm) cleave RNA transcripts, but not ssDNA, at the transcription bubble. Taken together, these results suggest that Type III systems primarily target transcripts, instead of unwound ssDNA in TECs, for immunity against double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) phages and plasmids. This reveals similarities between Csm and eukaryotic RNA interference, which also uses RNA-guided RNA targeting to silence actively transcribed genes.	TY Liu|JJ Liu|AJ Aditham|E Nogales|JA Doudna

However, arrays remain difficult to generate due to their reoccurring repeat sequences. Here, we report a modular, one-pot scheme called CRATES to construct CRISPR arrays and array libraries. CRATES allows assembly of repeat-spacer subunits using defined assembly junctions within the trimmed portion of spacers. Using CRATES, we construct arrays for the single-effector nucleases Cas9, Cas12a, and Cas13a that mediated multiplexed DNA/RNA cleavage and gene regulation in cell-free systems, bacteria, and yeast. CRATES further allows the one-pot construction of array libraries and composite arrays utilized by multiple Cas nucleases. Finally, array characterization reveals processing of extraneous CRISPR RNAs from Cas12a terminal repeats and sequence- and context-dependent loss of RNA-directed nuclease activity via global RNA structure formation. CRATES thus can facilitate diverse multiplexing applications and help identify factors impacting crRNA biogenesis.	C Liao|F Ttofali|RA Slotkowski|SR Denny|TD Cecil|RT Leenay|AJ Keung|CL Beisel

31267640	Biasing the sex ratio of populations of different organisms, including plants, insects, crustacean, and fish, has been demonstrated by genetic and non-genetic approaches. However, biasing the sex ratio of mammalian populations has not been demonstrated genetically. Here, we provide a first proof of concept for such a genetic system in mammals by crossing two genetically engineered mouse lines. The maternal line encodes a functional Cas9 protein on an autosomal chromosome, whereas the paternal line encodes guide RNAs on the Y chromosome targeting vital mouse genes. After fertilization, the presence of both the Y-encoded guide RNAs from the paternal sperm and the Cas9 protein from the maternal egg targets the vital genes in males. We show that these genes are specifically targeted in males and that this breeding consequently self-destructs solely males. Our results pave the way for a genetic system that allows biased sex production of livestock.	I Yosef|L Edry-Botzer|R Globus|I Shlomovitz|A Munitz|M Gerlic|U Qimron
31262257	The presence and activity of CRISPR-Cas defense systems is a hallmark of many prokaryotic microorganisms. Here, the distribution of sequences related to the highly iterated palindrome 1 (HIP1) element and the DNA methylation of CGATCG motifs embedded within HIP1 as a vital part of the CRISPR1 repeat sequence was analyzed in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Previously suggested functions of HIP1 include organization of chromosomal structure, DNA recombination or gene regulation, all of which could be relevant in CRISPR-Cas functionality.	The CRISPR1 repeat-spacer array contains more than 50 CGATCG elements that are double-methylated (5mCG6mATCG) by the enzymes M.Ssp6803I and M.Ssp6803III. Hence, more than 200 possible methylation events cluster over a stretch of 3600 bp of double-stranded DNA. Bisulfite sequencing showed that these motifs were highly methylated at the m5CGATCG positions whereas specific motifs within the CRISPR1 cas genes were hypomethylated suggesting a lowered accessibility for the DNA methylase to these regions. Assays for conjugation and CRISPR1-mediated DNA interference revealed a 50% drop in conjugation efficiency in the mutant lacking the 5mC methylation of CGATCG motifs, while the highly efficient DNA interference activity was not affected by the lack of m5CGATCG DNA-methylation, nor was the capability to differentiate between self and non-self targets based on the protospacer adjacent motifs (PAMs) GTA and GTC versus the non-PAM AGC. A third DNA methylation mediated by M.Ssp6803II modifies the first cytosine in the motif GGCC yielding GGm4CC. We found a remarkable absence of GGCC motifs and hence the corresponding methylation over an 11 kb stretch encompassing all the cas genes involved in interference and crRNA maturation but not adaptation of the CRISPR1 system.	The lack of GGCC tetranucleotides along the CRISPR1 interference and maturation genes supports the reported hybrid character of subtype I-D CRISPR-Cas systems. We report tight and very high 5mC methylation of the CRISPR1 repeat sequences. Nevertheless, cells lacking the 5mC methylation activity were unaffected in their CRISPR1-mediated interference response but the efficiency of conjugation was reduced by 50%. These results point to an unknown role of m5CGATCG DNA-methylation marks in conjugation and DNA transformation.	I Scholz|SC Lott|J Behler|K Gärtner|M Hagemann|WR Hess
31254926	Technologies harnessing CRISPR systems have been rapidly evolving and expanding the capacity of researchers for understanding of mammalian cell behavior and its underlying mechanisms through genome and epigenome manipulations. In this review, we summarized the recent developments of CRISPR-based technologies for genetic and epigenetic modifications that include engineering of Cas9 for PAM simplification, non-cleaving base editing tools and alteration of gene expression. Applications such as genome-wide screening methods or CRISPR-based DNA barcoding for cellular lineage tracking are highlighted. Anticipated and upcoming development for mammalian synthetic biology that includes organelle engineering is also discussed.	K Katayama|H Mitsunobu|K Nishida
31253785	Precise genome editing/correction of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) induced by CRISPR-Cas9 by homology-dependent repair (HDR) is limited by the competing error-prone non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) DNA repair pathway. Here, we define a safer and efficient system that promotes HDR-based precise genome editing, while reducing NHEJ locally, only at CRISPR-Cas9-induced DSBs. We fused a dominant-negative mutant of 53BP1, DN1S, to Cas9 nucleases, and the resulting Cas9-DN1S fusion proteins significantly block NHEJ events specifically at Cas9 cut sites and improve HDR frequency; HDR frequency reached 86% in K562 cells. Cas9-DN1S protein maintains this effect in different human cell types, including leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) patient-derived immortalized B lymphocytes, where nearly 70% of alleles were repaired by HDR and 7% by NHEJ. Our CRISPR-Cas9-DN1S system is clinically relevant to improve the efficiencies of precise gene correction/insertion, significantly reducing error-prone NHEJ events at the nuclease cleavage site, while avoiding the unwanted effects of global NHEJ inhibition.

31239539	Bacteria and archaea are locked in a near-constant battle with their viral pathogens. Despite previous mechanistic characterization of numerous prokaryotic defense strategies, the underlying ecological drivers of different strategies remain largely unknown and predicting which species will take which strategies remains a challenge. Here, we focus on the CRISPR immune strategy and develop a phylogenetically-corrected machine learning approach to build a predictive model of CRISPR incidence using data on over 100 traits across over 2600 species. We discover a strong but hitherto-unknown negative interaction between CRISPR and aerobicity, which we hypothesize may result from interference between CRISPR-associated proteins and non-homologous end-joining DNA repair due to oxidative stress. Our predictive model also quantitatively confirms previous observations of an association between CRISPR and temperature. Finally, we contrast the environmental associations of different CRISPR system types (I, II, III) and restriction modification systems, all of which act as intracellular immune systems.

31238873	Complete and contiguous genome assemblies greatly improve the quality of subsequent systems-wide functional profiling studies and the ability to gain novel biological insights. While a de novo genome assembly of an isolated bacterial strain is in most cases straightforward, more informative data about co-existing bacteria as well as synergistic and antagonistic effects can be obtained from a direct analysis of microbial communities. However, the complexity of metagenomic samples represents a major challenge. While third generation sequencing technologies have been suggested to enable finished metagenome-assembled genomes, to our knowledge, the complete genome assembly of all dominant strains in a microbiome sample has not been demonstrated. Natural whey starter cultures (NWCs) are used in cheese production and represent low-complexity microbiomes. Previous studies of Swiss Gruyère and selected Italian hard cheeses, mostly based on amplicon metagenomics, concurred that three species generally pre-dominate: Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii.	Two NWCs from Swiss Gruyère producers were subjected to whole metagenome shotgun sequencing using the Pacific Biosciences Sequel and Illumina MiSeq platforms. In addition, longer Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION reads had to be generated for one to resolve repeat regions. Thereby, we achieved the complete assembly of all dominant bacterial genomes from these low-complexity NWCs, which was corroborated by a 16S rRNA amplicon survey. Moreover, two distinct L. helveticus strains were successfully co-assembled from the same sample. Besides bacterial chromosomes, we could also assemble several bacterial plasmids and phages and a corresponding prophage. Biologically relevant insights were uncovered by linking the plasmids and phages to their respective host genomes using DNA methylation motifs on the plasmids and by matching prokaryotic CRISPR spacers with the corresponding protospacers on the phages. These results could only be achieved by employing long-read sequencing data able to span intragenomic as well as intergenomic repeats.	Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of complete de novo genome assembly of all dominant strains from low-complexity NWCs based on whole metagenomics shotgun sequencing data. This allowed to gain novel biological insights and is a fundamental basis for subsequent systems-wide omics analyses, functional profiling and phenotype to genotype analysis of specific microbial communities.

31237503	Despite the advent of CRISPR, safe and effective gene editing for human enhancement remains well beyond our current technological capabilities. For the discussion about enhancing human beings to be worth having, then, we must assume that gene-editing technology will improve rapidly. However, rapid progress in the development and application of any technology comes at a price: obsolescence. If the genetic enhancements we can provide children get better and better each year, then the enhancements granted to children born in any given year will rapidly go out of date. Sooner or later, every modified child will find him- or herself to be "yesterday's child." The impacts of such obsolescence on our individual, social, and philosophical self-understanding constitute an underexplored set of considerations relevant to the ethics of genome editing.	R Sparrow
31237429	Implementation of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) recombineering in Pseudomonas putida has widened the range of genetic manipulations applicable to this biotechnologically relevant bacterium. Yet, the relatively low efficiency of the technology hampers identification of mutated clones lacking conspicuous phenotypes. Fortunately, the use of CRISPR/Cas9 as a device for counterselection of wild-type sequences helps to overcome this limitation. Merging ssDNA recombineering with CRISPR/Cas9 thus enables a suite of genomic edits with a straightforward approach: a CRISPR plasmid provides the spacer DNA sequence that directs the Cas9 nuclease ribonucleoprotein complex to cleave the genome at the wild-type sequences that have not undergone the change entered by the mutagenic ssDNA oligonucleotide(s). This protocol describes a complete workflow of the method optimized for P. putida, although it could in principle be applicable to many other pseudomonads. As an example, we show the deletion of the edd gene that encodes one key enzyme that operates the EDEMP cycle for glucose metabolism in P. putida EM42. By combining two incompatible CRISPR plasmids with different antibiotic selection markers, we show that the procedure can be cycled to implement consecutive deletions in the same strain, e.g. deletion of the pyrF gene following that of the edd mutant. This approach adds to the wealth of genetic technologies available for P. putida and strengthens its status as a chassis of choice for a suite of biotechnological applications.

31236787	To inspect the feasibility of recombinant stable HEK293 cell lines development for biopharmaceuticals production using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated site-specific integration.	Using EGFP as a model protein, we first confirmed that the 'safe harbor' AAVS1 locus could be successfully targeted and the exogenous genes could be integrated through homology-directed repair induced by CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Then we constructed a donor plasmid harboring CTLA4Ig gene with an upstream CMV promoter and a downstream puromycin N-acetyltransferase gene to accelerate the efficient integration and selection of CTLA4Ig expression clones. After puromycin enrichment, the transfected pool was diluted for single clone selection, and 12 recombinant clones with CTLA4Ig expression were finally selected with a targeting efficiency of 25.8%. Productivity assay demonstrated that a frequency of 83.3% of selected clone were of consistent productivities, thus illustrating the high efficiency and success rate of this strategy.	CRISPR/Cas9 mediated site-specific integration is an efficient and reliable tool to establishment recombinant stable HEK293 cell lines for both academic and industrial applications.

31234957	The evolution of genome editing technology based on CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) system has led to a paradigm shift in biological research. CRISPR/Cas9-guide RNA complexes enable rapid and efficient genome editing in mammalian cells. This system induces double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) at target sites and most DNA breakages induce mutations as small insertions or deletions (indels) by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair pathway. However, for more precise correction as knock-in or replacement of DNA base pairs, using the homology-directed repair (HDR) pathway is essential. Until now, many trials have greatly enhanced knock-in or substitution efficiency by increasing HDR efficiency, or newly developed methods such as Base Editors (BEs). However, accuracy remains unsatisfactory. In this review, we summarize studies to overcome the limitations of HDR using the CRISPR system and discuss future direction.

31232162	Prokaryotic CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune systems rely on small non-coding RNAs derived from CRISPR loci to recognize and destroy complementary nucleic acids. However, the mechanism of Type IV CRISPR RNA (crRNA) biogenesis is poorly understood. To dissect the mechanism of Type IV CRISPR RNA biogenesis, we determined the x-ray crystal structure of the putative Type IV CRISPR associated endoribonuclease Cas6 from Mahella australiensis (Ma Cas6-IV) and characterized its enzymatic activity with RNA cleavage assays. We show that Ma Cas6-IV specifically cleaves Type IV crRNA repeats at the 3' side of a predicted stem loop, with a metal-independent, single-turnover mechanism that relies on a histidine and a tyrosine located within the putative endonuclease active site. Structure and sequence alignments with Cas6 orthologs reveal that although Ma Cas6-IV shares little sequence homology with other Cas6 proteins, all share common structural features that bind distinct crRNA repeat sequences. This analysis of Type IV crRNA biogenesis provides a structural and biochemical framework for understanding the similarities and differences of crRNA biogenesis across multi-subunit Class 1 CRISPR immune systems.

31229900	FOS is component of the AP-1 complex and has been reported to be involved in many cellular functions, including cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, angiogenesis, hematopoiesis and cancer progress. To further understand the exact role of FOS in these processes, here we created two FOS knockout human embryonic stem cell lines by CRISPR/Cas9 mediated gene targeting. These cell lines retained normal morphology and karyotype, normal expression of pluripotent markers, and differentiation potential both in vivo and in vitro. These cell lines can be used to verify whether the FOS mutated produces any affect on endothelial cells and hematopoietic progenitor cells during the hematopoietic differentiation.

31223286	The transcriptional coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300 are adenoviral E1A-binding proteins involved in various cellular processes, including embryonic development, homeostasis, cell differentiation and transcription activation. Previous study suggested that synthetic lethality between CBP and p300 inhibition in lung and hematopoietic cancers. However, the underlying mechanism of CBP and p300 paralog in bladder cancer remains unknown. In this study, we discovered that combined CBP and p300 inhibition impaired cell proliferation and induced apoptosis of bladder cancer cells and normal bladder urothelial cell via decreasing c-Myc expression. Then, we employed the dCas9-KRAB system, hTERT promoter and hUPII promoter to construct an CRISPR interference system which could specifically repress CBP and p300 expression and cause lethality in bladder cancer cells in vitro. The CRISPR interference system we constructed could specifically inhibit the progression of bladder cancer, providing a novel strategy to fight against bladder cancer.

31219587	Acquiring foreign spacer DNA into the CRISPR locus is an essential primary step of the CRISPR-Cas pathway in prokaryotes for developing host immunity to mobile genetic elements. Here, we investigate spacer integration in vitro using proteins from Pyrococcus furiosus and demonstrate that Cas1 and Cas2 are sufficient to accurately integrate spacers into a minimal CRISPR locus. Using high-throughput sequencing, we identified high frequency spacer integration occurring at the same CRISPR repeat border sites utilized in vivo, as well as at several non-CRISPR plasmid sequences which share features with repeats. Analysis of non-CRISPR integration sites revealed that Cas1 and Cas2 are directed to catalyze full-site spacer integration at specific DNA stretches where guanines and/or cytosines are 30 base pairs apart and the intervening sequence harbors several positionally conserved bases. Moreover, assaying a series of CRISPR repeat mutations, followed by sequencing of the integration products, revealed that the specificity of integration is primarily directed by sequences at the leader-repeat junction as well as an adenine-rich sequence block in the mid-repeat. Together, our results indicate that P. furiosus Cas1 and Cas2 recognize multiple sequence features distributed over a 30 base pair DNA region for accurate spacer integration at the CRISPR repeat.

31215001	Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) is a highly pathogenic tick-borne bunyavirus that causes lethal infectious disease and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) in humans. The molecular mechanisms and host cellular factors required for SFTSV infection remain uncharacterized. Using a genome-wide CRISPR-based screening strategy, we identified a host cellular protein, sorting nexin 11 (SNX11) which is involved in the intracellular endosomal trafficking pathway, as an essential cell factor for SFTSV infection. An SNX11-KO HeLa cell line was established, and SFTSV replication was significantly reduced. The glycoproteins of SFTSV were detected and remained in later endosomal compartments but were not detectable in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or Golgi apparatus. pH values in the endosomal compartments of the SNX11-KO cells increased compared with the pH of normal HeLa cells, and lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) expression was significantly elevated in the SNX11-KO cells. Overall, these results indicated that penetration of SFTSV from the endolysosomes into the cytoplasm of host cells was blocked in the cells lacking SNX11. Our study for the first time provides insight into the important role of the SNX11 as an essential host factor in the intracellular trafficking and penetrating process of SFTSV infection via potential regulation of viral protein sorting, membrane fusion, and other endocytic machinery.

31212208	Mammalian development involves continuous dynamic processes in which cells propagate, differentiate, orchestrate, and decease to produce high-order functions. Although accurate cell lineage information can provide a strong foundation to understand such complex processes, the cell lineages involved in development of the whole mammalian body remain largely unclear, except for in early embryogenesis, which is observable under a microscope. With CRISPR genome editing, the concept of 'evolving DNA barcodes' has rapidly emerged for large-scale, high-resolution cell lineage tracing, where cell-embedded DNA barcodes continuously accumulate random mutations that are inherited from mother to daughter cells. Similar to evolutionary tree reconstruction using species' DNA sequences, cell lineages can be reconstructed using shared mutation patterns in the DNA barcodes identified using massively parallel sequencing. The dramatic developments of single-cell and imaging technologies have enabled analyses of the molecular and spatial architecture of heterogeneous cells. The evolving DNA barcodes can also consolidate this information on a reconstructed cell lineage tree and accelerate our understanding of multicellular organisms.	N Masuyama|H Mori|N Yachie
31205318	High efficiency, ease of use and versatility of the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) system has facilitated advanced genetic modification of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a model organism and workhorse in industrial biotechnology. CRISPR-associated protein 12a (Cas12a), an RNA-guided endonuclease with features distinguishable from Cas9 is applied in this work, further extending the molecular toolbox for genome editing purposes. A benefit of the CRISPR/Cas12a system is that it can be used in multiplex genome editing with multiple guide RNAs expressed from a single transcriptional unit (single CRISPR RNA (crRNA) array). We present a protocol for multiplex integration of multiple heterologous genes into independent loci of the S. cerevisiae genome using the CRISPR/Cas12a system with multiple crRNAs expressed from a single crRNA array construct. The proposed method exploits the ability of S. cerevisiae to perform in vivo recombination of DNA fragments to assemble the single crRNA array into a plasmid that can be used for transformant selection, as well as the assembly of donor DNA sequences that integrate into the genome at intended positions. Cas12a is pre-expressed constitutively, facilitating cleavage of the S. cerevisiae genome at the intended positions upon expression of the single crRNA array. The protocol includes the design and construction of a single crRNA array and donor DNA expression cassettes, and exploits an integration approach making use of unique 50-bp DNA connectors sequences and separate integration flank DNA sequences, which simplifies experimental design through standardization and modularization and extends the range of applications. Finally, we demonstrate a straightforward technique for creating yeast pixel art with an acoustic liquid handler using differently colored carotenoid producing yeast strains that were constructed.

31198958	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9), comprising an RNA-guided DNA endonuclease and a programmable guide RNA (gRNA), is currently recognized to be a powerful genome-editing tool and is widely used in biological science. Despite the usefulness of the system, a protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) immediately downstream of the target sequence needs to be taken into account in the design of the gRNA, a requirement which limits the flexibility of the CRISPR-based genome-editing system. To overcome this limitation, a Cas9 isolated from Streptococcus pyogenes, namely SpCas9, engineered to develop several variants of Cas9 nuclease, has been generated. SpCas9 recognizes the NGG sequence as the PAM, whereas its variants are capable of interacting with different PAMs. Despite the potential advantage of the Cas9 variants, their functionalities have not previously been tested in the widely used model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, we developed a plant-specific vector series harboring SpCas9-VQR (NGAN or NGNG) or SpCas9-EQR (NGAG) and evaluated their functionalities. These modified Cas9 nucleases efficiently introduced mutations into the CLV3 and AS1 target genes using gRNAs that were compatible with atypical PAMs. Furthermore, the generated mutations were passed on to their offspring. This study illustrated the usefulness of the SpCas9 variants because the ability to generate heritable mutations will be of great benefit in molecular genetic analyses. A greater number of potential SpCas9-variant-recognition sites in these genes are predicted, compared with those of conventional SpCas9. These results demonstrated the usefulness of the SpCas9 variants for genome editing in the field of plant science research.	A Yamamoto|T Ishida|M Yoshimura|Y Kimura|S Sawa

31196871	CRISPR-Cas9-based genome editing has transformed the life sciences, enabling virtually unlimited genetic manipulation of genomes: The RNA-guided Cas9 endonuclease cuts DNA at a specific target sequence and the resulting double-strand breaks are mended by one of the intrinsic cellular repair pathways. Imprecise double-strand repair will introduce random mutations such as indels or point mutations, whereas precise editing will restore or specifically edit the locus as mandated by an endogenous or exogenously provided template. Recent studies indicate that CRISPR-induced DNA cuts may also result in the exchange of genetic information between homologous chromosome arms. However, conclusive data of such recombination events in higher eukaryotes are lacking. Here, we show that in Drosophila, the detected Cas9-mediated editing events frequently resulted in germline-transmitted exchange of chromosome arms-often without indels. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of using the system for generating recombinants and also highlight an unforeseen risk of using CRISPR-Cas9 for therapeutic intervention.

31195968	Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. brasiliense is a broad host range bacterial pathogen, which causes blackleg of potatoes and bacterial soft rot of vegetables worldwide. Production of plant cell wall degrading enzymes is usually critical for Pectobacterium infection. However, other virulence factors and the mechanisms of genetic adaptation still need to be studied in detail.	In this study, the complete genome of P. carotovorum subsp. brasiliense strain SX309 isolated from cucumber was compared with eight other pathogenic bacteria belonging to the Pectobacterium genus, which were isolated from various host plants. Genome comparison revealed that most virulence genes are highly conserved in the Pectobacterium strains, especially for the key virulence determinants involved in the biosynthesis of extracellular enzymes and others including the type II and III secretion systems, quorum sensing system, flagellar and chemotactic genes. Nevertheless, some variable regions of the T6SS and the CRISP-Cas immune system are unique for P. carotovorum subsp. brasiliense.	The extensive comparative genomics analysis revealed highly conserved virulence genes in the Pectobacterium strains. However, several variable regions of type VI secretion system and two subtype Cas mechanism-Cas immune systems possibly contribute to the process of Pectobacterium infection and adaptive immunity.

31186424	Cas13d, the type VI-D CRISPR-Cas effector, is an RNA-guided ribonuclease that has been repurposed to edit RNA in a programmable manner. Here we report the detailed structural and functional analysis of the uncultured Ruminococcus sp. Cas13d (UrCas13d)-crRNA complex. Two hydrated Mg2+ ions aid in stabilizing the conformation of the crRNA repeat region. Sequestration of divalent metal ions does not alter pre-crRNA processing, but abolishes target cleavage by UrCas13d. Notably, the pre-crRNA processing is executed by the HEPN-2 domain. Furthermore, both the structure and sequence of the nucleotides U(-8)-C(-1) within the repeat region are indispensable for target cleavage, and are specifically recognized by UrCas13d. Moreover, correct base pairings within two separate spacer regions (an internal and a 3'-end region) are essential for target cleavage. These findings provide a framework for the development of Cas13d into a tool for a wide range of applications.

31186306	The introduction of exogenous genes in single-copy at precise genomic locations is a powerful tool that has been widely used in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans Here, we have streamlined the process by creating a rapid, cloning-free method of single-copy transgene insertion we call Mos1 element-mediated CRISPR integration (mmCRISPi). The protocol combines the impact of Mos1 mediated single-copy gene insertion (mosSCI) with the ease of CRISPR/Cas9 mediated gene editing, allowing in vivo construction of transgenes from linear DNA fragments integrated at defined loci in the C. elegans genome. This approach was validated by defining its efficiency at different integration sites in the genome and by testing transgene insert size. The mmCRISPi method benefits from in vivo recombination of overlapping PCR fragments, allowing researchers to mix-and-match between promoters, protein-coding sequences, and 3' untranslated regions, all inserted in a single step at a defined Mos1 loci.

31186288	Prokaryotes can defend themselves against invading mobile genetic elements (MGEs) by acquiring immune memory against them. The memory is a DNA database located at specific chromosomal sites called CRISPRs (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) that store fragments of MGE DNA. These are utilised to target and destroy returning MGEs, preventing re-infection. The effectiveness of CRISPR-based immune defence depends on 'adaptation' reactions that capture and integrate MGE DNA fragments into CRISPRs. This provides the means for immunity to be delivered against MGEs in 'interference' reactions. Adaptation and interference are catalysed by Cas (CRISPR-associated) proteins, aided by enzymes well known for other roles in cells. We survey the molecular biology of CRISPR adaptation, highlighting entirely new developments that may help us to understand how MGE DNA is captured. We focus on processes in Escherichia coli, punctuated with reference to other prokaryotes that illustrate how common requirements for adaptation, DNA capture and integration, can be achieved in different ways. We also comment on how CRISPR adaptation enzymes, and their antecedents, can be utilised for biotechnology.	CH Lau|R Reeves|EL Bolt

31177615	We report the first application of CRISPR-Cas technology to single species detection from environmental DNA (eDNA). Organisms shed and excrete DNA into their environment such as in skin cells and faeces, referred to as environmental DNA (eDNA). Utilising eDNA allows noninvasive monitoring with increased specificity and sensitivity. Current methods primarily employ PCR-based techniques to detect a given species from eDNA samples, posing a logistical challenge for on-site monitoring and potential adaptation to biosensor devices. We have developed an alternative method; coupling isothermal amplification to a CRISPR-Cas12a detection system. This utilises the collateral cleavage activity of Cas12a, a ribonuclease guided by a highly specific single CRISPR RNA. We used the target species Salmo salar as a proof-of-concept test of the specificity of the assay among closely related species and to show the assay is successful at a single temperature of 37°C with signal detection at 535 nM. The specific assay, detects at attomolar sensitivity with rapid detection rates (<2.5 hr). This approach simplifies the challenge of building a biosensor device for rapid target species detection in the field and can be easily adapted to detect any species from eDNA samples from a variety of sources enhancing the capabilities of eDNA as a tool for monitoring biodiversity.

To analyze the characteristics and functions of the CRISPR/Cas system in Proteus genomes, as well as the internal and external factors affecting the system.	CRISPR loci were identified and divided into groups based on the repeat sequence in 96 Proteus strains by identification. Compared the RNA secondary structure and minimum free energy of CRISPR loci through bioinformatics, the evolution of cas genes, and the effects of related elements were also discussed.	85 CRISPR loci were identified and divided into six groups based on the sequence of repeats, and the more stable the secondary structure of RNA, the smaller the minimum free energy, the fewer base mutations in the repeat, the more stable the CRISPR and the more complete the evolution of the system. In addition, Cas1 gene can be a symbol to distinguish species to some extent. Of all the influencing factors, CRISPR/Cas had the greatest impact on plasmids.	This study examined the diversity of CRISPR/Cas system in Proteus and found statistically significant positive/negative correlations between variety factors (the RNA stability, free energy, etc.) and the CRISPR locus, which played a vital role in regulating the CRISPR/Cas system.

31175427	Purpureocillium lilacinum is a promising commercial agent for controlling plant-parasitic nematodes and plant pathogens. Leucinostatins are a family of lipopeptides produced by P. lilacinum that are synthesized, modified, and regulated by a gene cluster consisting of 20 genes. Sequence analyses have indicated that lcsL, a gene in the lcs cluster, is a putative bZIP transcription factor. In this study, the CRISPR-Cas9 system was introduced to increase the efficiency of homologous recombination for the disruption of lcsL. The expression of genes in the cluster was significantly reduced in lcsL disruption mutants, and the output of leucinostatins was decreased to undetectable levels. In the lcsL overexpression strain, the expression of genes in the cluster and the yield of leucinostatins were all increased. The antagonism of both the wild type and mutant against Phytophthora infestans was also consistent with the gene expression and the output of leucinostatins. These results indicate that the gene lcsL is crucial for the regulating the synthesis of leucinostatins.	Y Jiao|Y Li|Y Li|H Cao|Z Mao|J Ling|Y Yang|B Xie

31172914	The past 10 years have been revolutionary for clostridial genetics. The rise of next-generation sequencing led to the availability of annotated whole-genome sequences of the important pathogenic clostridia: Clostridium perfringens, Clostridioides (Clostridium) difficile, and Clostridium botulinum, but also Paeniclostridium (Clostridium) sordellii and Clostridium tetani. These sequences were a prerequisite for the development of functional, sophisticated genetic tools for the pathogenic clostridia. A breakthrough came in the early 2000s with the development of TargeTron-based technologies specific for the clostridia, such as ClosTron, an insertional gene inactivation tool. The following years saw a plethora of new technologies being developed, mostly for C. difficile, but also for other members of the genus, including C. perfringens. A range of tools is now available, allowing researchers to precisely delete genes, change single nucleotides in the genome, complement deletions, integrate novel DNA into genomes, or overexpress genes. There are tools for forward genetics, including an inducible transposon mutagenesis system for C. difficile. As the latest addition to the tool kit, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas9 technologies have also been adopted for the construction of single and multiple gene deletions in C. difficile. This article summarizes the key genetic technologies available to manipulate, study, and understand the pathogenic clostridia.	SA Kuehne|JI Rood|D Lyras
31169010	DNA holds genetic information in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells; and has three different functions: replication, storage of hereditary information, and regulation of cell division. Most studies described the association of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) to common orthopaedics diseases and the susceptibility to develop musculoskeletal injuries. Several mutations are associated with osteoporosis, musculoskeletal ailments and other musculoskeletal deformity and conditions. Several strategies, including gene therapy and tissue engineering with mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), have been proposed to enhance healing of musculoskeletal tissues. Furthermore, a recent technique has revolutionized gene editing: clustered regulatory interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) technology is characterized by simplicity in target design, affordability, versatility, and high efficiency, but needs more studies to become the preferred platform for genome editing. Predictive genomics DNA profiling allows to understand which genetic advantage, if any, may be exploited, and why a given rehabilitation protocol can be more effective in some individual than others. In conclusion, a better understanding of the genetic influence on the function of the musculoskeletal system and healing of its ailments is needed to plan and develop patient specific management strategies.

31165970	Genome editing is essential for probing genotype-phenotype relationships and for enhancing chemical production and phenotypic robustness in industrial bacteria. Currently, the most popular tools for genome editing couple recombineering with DNA cleavage by the CRISPR nuclease Cas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes. Although successful in some model strains, CRISPR-based genome editing has been slow to extend to the multitude of industrially relevant bacteria. In this review, we analyze existing barriers to implementing CRISPR-based editing across diverse bacterial species. We first compare the efficacy of current CRISPR-based editing strategies. Next, we discuss alternatives when the S. pyogenes Cas9 does not yield colonies. Finally, we describe different ways bacteria can evade editing and how elucidating these failure modes can improve CRISPR-based genome editing across strains. Together, this review highlights existing obstacles to CRISPR-based editing in bacteria and offers guidelines to help achieve and enhance editing in a wider range of bacterial species, including non-model strains.

31165703	T-cell immunotherapy is showing great promise and therefore undergoing intensive developments for cancer treatment. In this study, we applied liposome-encapsulated Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated protein-9 nuclease (Cas9) (CRISPR/Cas9) genome editing tool to specifically knock out the programmed death-1 (PD-1) gene from T cells (PD-1- T cells). We then activated these cells by dendritic/tumor fusion cells (FCs) and examined their anti-cancer potential. Results showed that, following the antigen presentation and activation by DC/HepG2 FCs, PD-1- T cells showed a significantly higher ability than PD-1+ T cells to proliferate, secrete pro-inflammatory cytokine IFN-γ, and kill HepG2 cells in vitro. Consistently, in vitro activated PD-1- T cells inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in HepG2 xenografts in vivo, leading to significantly suppressed tumor growth and improved mouse survival. Liposome-encapsulated CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology effectively knocked out PD-1 gene in T cells, stimulating T cell activation in response to DC/tumor FCs and affording T cell-mediated cancer immunotherapy. Our study provides evidence to target checkpoint receptors in adoptively transfected T cells, as a novel therapeutic modality for adoptive T cell transfer.

31161346	Understanding the molecular mechanisms behind beta cell dysfunction is essential for the development of effective and specific approaches for diabetes care and prevention. Physiological human beta cell models are needed for this work. We review the possibilities and limitations of currently available human beta cell models and how they can be dramatically enhanced using genome-editing technologies. In addition to the gold standard, primary isolated islets, other models now include immortalised human beta cell lines and pluripotent stem cell-derived islet-like cells. The scarcity of human primary islet samples limits their use, but valuable gene expression and functional data from large collections of human islets have been made available to the scientific community. The possibilities for studying beta cell physiology using immortalised human beta cell lines and stem cell-derived islets are rapidly evolving. However, the functional immaturity of these cells is still a significant limitation. CRISPR-Cas9 (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9) has enabled precise engineering of specific genetic variants, targeted transcriptional modulation and genome-wide genetic screening. These approaches can now be exploited to gain understanding of the mechanisms behind coding and non-coding diabetes-associated genetic variants, allowing more precise evaluation of their contribution to diabetes pathogenesis. Despite all the progress, genome editing in primary pancreatic islets remains difficult to achieve, an important limitation requiring further technological development.

31151983	The success of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/PD-L1-based immunotherapy highlights the critical role played by PD-L1 in cancer progression and reveals an urgent need to develop new approaches to attenuate PD-L1 function by gaining insight into how its expression is controlled. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALK+ ALCL) expresses a high level of PD-L1 as a result of the constitutive activation of multiple oncogenic signaling pathways downstream of ALK activity, making it an excellent model in which to define the signaling processes responsible for PD-L1 upregulation in tumor cells. Here, using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 library screening, we sought a comprehensive understanding of the molecular effectors required for PD-L1 regulation in ALK+ ALCL. Indeed, we determined that PD-L1 induction is dependent on the nucleophosmin-ALK oncoprotein activation of STAT3, as well as a signalosome containing GRB2/SOS1, which activates the MEK-ERK and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways. These signaling networks, through STAT3 and the GRB2/SOS1, ultimately induce PD-L1 expression through the action of transcription factors IRF4 and BATF3 on the enhancer region of the PD-L1 gene. IRF4 and BATF3 are essential for PD-L1 upregulation, and IRF4 expression is correlated with PD-L1 levels in primary ALK+ ALCL tissues. Targeting this oncogenic signaling pathway in ALK+ ALCL largely inhibited the ability of PD-L1-mediated tumor immune escape when cocultured with PD-1-positive T cells and natural killer cells. Thus, our identification of this previously unrecognized regulatory hub not only accelerates our understanding of the molecular circuitry that drives tumor immune escape but also provides novel opportunities to improve immunotherapeutic intervention strategies.

31149642	Precise genome editing is limited by the inefficiency of homology-directed repair (HDR) compared to the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) of double strand breaks (DSBs). The CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat)/Cas9 system generates precise, locus-specific DSBs that can serve as substrates for HDR. We developed an in vivo visual reporter assay to quantify HDR-mediated events at single-cell resolution in zebrafish and used this system to identify small-molecule modulators that shift the DNA repair equilibrium in favor of HDR. By further optimizing the reaction environment and repair template, we achieved dramatic enhancement of HDR-mediated repair efficiency in zebrafish. Accordingly, under optimized conditions, inhibition of NHEJ with NU7441 enhanced HDR-mediated repair up to 13.4-fold. Importantly, we demonstrate that the increase in somatic HDR events correlates directly with germline transmission, permitting the efficient recovery of large seamlessly integrated DNA fragments in zebrafish.

31147612	The prokaryote-derived CRISPR-Cas genome editing systems have transformed our ability to manipulate, detect, image and annotate specific DNA and RNA sequences in living cells of diverse species. The ease of use and robustness of this technology have revolutionized genome editing for research ranging from fundamental science to translational medicine. Initial successes have inspired efforts to discover new systems for targeting and manipulating nucleic acids, including those from Cas9, Cas12, Cascade and Cas13 orthologues. Genome editing by CRISPR-Cas can utilize non-homologous end joining and homology-directed repair for DNA repair, as well as single-base editing enzymes. In addition to targeting DNA, CRISPR-Cas-based RNA-targeting tools are being developed for research, medicine and diagnostics. Nuclease-inactive and RNA-targeting Cas proteins have been fused to a plethora of effector proteins to regulate gene expression, epigenetic modifications and chromatin interactions. Collectively, the new advances are considerably improving our understanding of biological processes and are propelling CRISPR-Cas-based tools towards clinical use in gene and cell therapies.

31147515	Complex genetic mechanisms are thought to underlie many human diseases, yet experimental proof of this model has been elusive. Here, we show that a human cardiac anomaly can be caused by a combination of rare, inherited heterozygous mutations. Whole-exome sequencing of a nuclear family revealed that three offspring with childhood-onset cardiomyopathy had inherited three missense single-nucleotide variants in the MKL2, MYH7, and NKX2-5 genes. The MYH7 and MKL2 variants were inherited from the affected, asymptomatic father and the rare NKX2-5 variant (minor allele frequency, 0.0012) from the unaffected mother. We used CRISPR-Cas9 to generate mice encoding the orthologous variants and found that compound heterozygosity for all three variants recapitulated the human disease phenotype. Analysis of murine hearts and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes provided histologic and molecular evidence for the NKX2-5 variant's contribution as a genetic modifier.

31140325	Degenerative disc disease (DDD) is a primary contributor to low-back pain, a leading cause of disability. Progression of DDD is aided by inflammatory cytokines in the intervertebral disc (IVD), particularly TNF-α and IL-1β, but current treatments fail to effectively target this mechanism. The objective of this study was to explore the feasibility of Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) epigenome editing-based therapy for DDD, by modulation of TNFR1/IL1R1 signaling in pathological human IVD cells. Human IVD cells from the nucleus pulposus of patients receiving surgery for back pain were obtained and the regulation of TNFR1/IL1R1 signaling by a lentiviral CRISPR epigenome editing system was tested. These cells were tested for successful lentiviral transduction/expression of deactivated Cas9 fused to Krüppel Associated Box system and regulation of TNFR1/IL1R1 expression. TNFR1/IL1R1 signaling disruption was investigated through measurement of NF-κB activity, apoptosis, and anabolic/catabolic changes in gene expression postinflammatory challenge. CRISPR epigenome editing systems were effectively introduced into pathological human IVD cells and significantly downregulated TNFR1 and IL1R1. This downregulation significantly attenuated deleterious TNFR1 signaling but not IL1R1 signaling. This is attributed to less robust IL1R1 expression downregulation, and IL-1β-driven reversal of IL1R1 expression downregulation in a portion of patient IVD cells. In addition, RNAseq data indicated novel transcription factor targets, IRF1 and TFAP2C, as being primary regulators of inflammatory signaling in IVD cells. These results demonstrate the feasibility of CRISPR epigenome editing of inflammatory receptors in pathological IVD cells, but highlight a limitation in epigenome targeting of IL1R1. This method has potential application as a novel gene therapy for DDD, to attenuate the deleterious effect of inflammatory cytokines present in the degenerative IVD.

31139899	Bacillus methanolicus is a thermophilic, Gram-positive, rod-shaped bacterium. It is a facultative methylotroph which can use carbon and energy sources including mannitol and the one-carbon (C1) and non-food substrate methanol for growth and overproduction of amino acids, which makes it a promising candidate for biotechnological applications. Despite a growing tool box for gene cloning and expression, tools for targeted chromosomal gene knockouts and gene repression are still missing for this organism. Here, the CRISPRi-dCas9 technique for gene repression was established in B. methanolicus MGA3. Significantly reduced spore formation on the one hand and increased biofilm formation on the other hand could be demonstrated when the stage zero sporulation protein A gene spo0A was targeted. Furthermore, when the mannitol-1-phosphate 5-dehydrogenase gene mtlD was targeted by CRISPRi, mtlD RNA levels, and MtlD specific activities in crude extracts were decreased to about 50 % which resulted in reduced biomass formation from mannitol. As a third target, the catalase gene katA was chosen. Upon targeting katA by CRISPRi, catalase activity was decreased to about 25 % as shown in H2O2 drop assays and by determination of specific catalase activity in crude extracts. Our results support the predicted functions of Spo0A in sporulation and biofilm formation, of MtlD for mannitol catabolism, and of catalase in hydrogen peroxide dismutation. Thus, CRISPR interference as developed here serves as basis for the functional characterization of B. methanolicus physiology as well as for its application in biotechnology.

31138654	Work in yeast models has benefitted tremendously from the insertion of epitope or fluorescence tags at the native gene locus to study protein function and behavior under physiological conditions. In contrast, work in mammalian cells largely relies on overexpression of tagged proteins because high-quality antibodies are only available for a fraction of the mammalian proteome. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing has recently emerged as a powerful genome-modifying tool that can also be exploited to insert various tags and fluorophores at gene loci to study the physiological behavior of proteins in most organisms, including mammals. Here we describe a versatile toolset for rapid tagging of endogenous proteins. The strategy utilizes CRISPR/Cas9 and microhomology-mediated end joining repair for efficient tagging. We provide tools to insert 3×HA, His6FLAG, His6-Biotin-TEV-RGSHis6, mCherry, GFP, and the auxin-inducible degron tag for compound-induced protein depletion. This approach and the developed tools should greatly facilitate functional analysis of proteins in their native environment.	DW Lin|BP Chung|JW Huang|X Wang|L Huang|P Kaiser
31134321	Clostridium perfringens is an important pathogen of human and livestock infections, posing a threat to health. The horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of plasmids that carry toxin-related genes is involved in C. perfringens pathogenicity. The CRISPR/Cas system, which has been identified in a wide range of prokaryotes, provides acquired immunity against HGT. However, information about the CRISPR/Cas system in Clostridium perfringens is still limited. In this study, 111 C. perfringens strains with publicly available genomes were used to analyze the occurrence and diversity of CRISPR/Cas system and evaluate the potential of CRISPR-based genotyping in this multi-host pathogen. A total of 59 out of the 111 genomes harbored at least one confirmed CRISPR array. Four CRISPR/Cas system subtypes, including subtypes IB, IIA, IIC, and IIID systems, were identified in 32 strains. Subtype IB system was the most prevalent in this species, which was subdivided into four subgroups displaying subgroup specificity in terms of cas gene content, repeat sequence content, and PAM. We showed that the CRISPR spacer polymorphism can be used for evolutionary studies, and that it can provide discriminatory power for typing strains. Nevertheless, the application of this approach was largely limited to strains that contain the CRISPR/Cas system. Spacer origin analysis revealed that approximately one-fifth of spacers showed significant matches to plasmids and phages, thereby suggesting the implication of CRISPR/Cas systems in controlling HGT. Collectively, our results provide new insights into the diversity and evolution of CRISPR/Cas system in C. perfringens.	J Long|Y Xu|L Ou|H Yang|Y Xi|S Chen|G Duan
31133730	Ex vivo CRISPR gene editing in haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells has opened potential treatment modalities for numerous diseases. The current process uses electroporation, sometimes followed by virus transduction. While this complex manipulation has resulted in high levels of gene editing at some genetic loci, cellular toxicity was observed. We have developed a CRISPR nanoformulation based on colloidal gold nanoparticles with a unique loading design capable of cellular entry without the need for electroporation or viruses. This highly monodispersed nanoformulation avoids lysosomal entrapment and localizes to the nucleus in primary human blood progenitors without toxicity. Nanoformulation-mediated gene editing is efficient and sustained with different CRISPR nucleases at multiple loci of therapeutic interest. The engraftment kinetics of nanoformulation-treated primary cells in humanized mice are better relative to those of non-treated cells, with no differences in differentiation. Here we demonstrate non-toxic delivery of the entire CRISPR payload into primary human blood progenitors.	R Shahbazi|G Sghia-Hughes|JL Reid|S Kubek|KG Haworth|O Humbert|HP Kiem|JE Adair
31129735	Conventional methods for gene function study in Brassica campestris have lots of drawbacks, which greatly hinder the identification of important genes' functions and molecular breeding. The clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) system is a versatile tool for genome editing that has been widely utilized in many plant species and has many advantages over conventional methods for gene function study. However, the application of CRISPR/Cas9 system in B. campestris remains unreported. The pectin-methylesterase genes Bra003491, Bra007665, and Bra014410 were selected as the targets of the CRISPR/Cas9 system. A single-targeting vector and a multitargeting vector were constructed. Different types of mutations were detected in T0 generation through Agrobacterium transformation. The mutation rate of the three designed sgRNA seeds varied from 20 to 56%. Although the majority of T0 mutants were chimeric, four homozygous mutants were identified. Transformation with the multitargeting vector generated one line with a large fragment deletion and one line with mutations in two target genes. Mutations in Bra003491 were stable and inherited by T1 and T2 generations. Nine mutants which did not contain T-DNA insertions were also obtained. No mutations were detected in predicted potential off-target sites. Our work demonstrated that CRISPR/Cas9 system is efficient on single and multiplex genome editing without off-targeting in B. campestris and that the mutations are stable and inheritable. Our results may greatly facilitate gene functional studies and the molecular breeding of B. campestris and other plants.	X Xiong|W Liu|J Jiang|L Xu|L Huang|J Cao
31126462	Escherichia coli was engineered to produce d-pantothenic acid via systematic metabolic engineering. Firstly, genes of acetohydroxy acid synthase II, pantothenate synthetase, 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate hydroxymethyltransferase, 2-dehydropantoate 2-reductase and ketol-acid reductoisomerase were edited in E. coli W3110 with a resulting d-pantothenic acid yield of 0.49 g/L. Expressions of valine-pyruvate aminotransferase and branched-chain-amino-acid aminotransferase were then attenuated to decrease the carbon flux in l-valine biosynthetic pathway which is a competing pathway to the d-pantothenic acid biosynthetic pathway, and the yield increased to 1.48 g/L. Mutagenesis of pantothenate kinase and deletion of threonine deaminase further increased the production to 1.78 g/L. Overexpressions of panC and panB from Corynebacterium glutamicum enhanced the production by 29%. In fed-batch fermentations, strain DPA-9/pTrc99a-panBC(C.G) exhibited a highest d-pantothenic acid yield of 28.45 g/L. The findings in this study demonstrate the systematic metabolic engineering in Escherichia coli W3110 would be a promising strategy for industrial production of d-pantothenic acid.

31125796	Recent advances in biotechnology such as Hi-C, CRISPR/Cas9 and ribosome display have placed nucleoprotein complexes at center stage. Understanding the structural dynamics of these complexes aids in optimizing protocols and interpreting data for these new technologies. The integration of simulation and experiment has helped advance mechanistic understanding of these systems. Coarse-grained simulations, reduced-description models, and explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations yield useful complementary perspectives on nucleoprotein complex structural dynamics. When combined with Hi-C, cryo-EM, and single molecule measurements, these simulations integrate disparate forms of experimental data into a coherent mechanism.	KY Sanbonmatsu
31125685	RNA viruses are the most diverse phytopathogens which cause severe epidemics in important agricultural crops and threaten the global food security. Being obligatory intracellular pathogens, these viruses have developed fine-tuned evading mechanisms and are non-responsive to most of the prophylactic treatments. Additionally, their sprint ability to overcome host defense demands a broad-spectrum and durable mechanism of resistance. In context of CRISPR-Cas discoveries, some variants of Cas effectors have been characterized as programmable RNA-guided RNases in the microbial genomes and could be reprogramed in mammalian and plant cells with guided RNase activity. Recently, the RNA variants of CRISPR-Cas systems have been successfully employed in plants to engineer resistance against RNA viruses. Some variants of CRISPR-Cas9 have been tamed either for directly targeting plant RNA viruses' genome or through targeting the host genes/factors assisting in viral proliferation. The new frontiers in CRISPR-Cas discoveries, and more importantly shifting towards RNA targeting will pyramid the opportunities in plant virus research. The current review highlights the probable implications of CRISPR-Cas system to confer the pathogen-derived or host-mediated resistance against phytopathogenic RNA viruses. Furthermore, a multiplexed CRISPR-Cas13a methodology is proposed here to combat Potato virus Y (PVY); a globally diverse phytopathogen infecting multiple crops.

31122258	Surfactin is a cyclic lipopeptide that is of great industrial use owing to its extraordinary surfactant power and antimicrobial, antiviral, and antitumor activities. Surfactin is synthesized by a condensation reaction in microbes, which uses fatty acids and four kinds of amino acids (L-glutamate, L-aspartate, L-leucine and L-valine) as precursors. Surfactin biosynthesis could be improved by increasing the supply of fatty acids; however, the effect of the regulation of amino acid metabolism on surfactin production was not yet clear.	In this study, we aimed to improve surfactin production in B. subtilis by repressing the genes on the branch metabolic pathways of amino acid biosynthesis using CRISPRi technology. First, 20 genes were inhibited individually, resulting in 2.5- to 627-fold decreases in transcriptional level as determined by RT-qPCR. Among the 20 recombinant strains, 16 strains obtained higher surfactin titres than that produced by the parent BS168NU-Sd strain (the surfactin production of BS168NU-Sd with only dCas9 but no sgRNA expression was 0.17 g/L). In particular, the strains in which the yrpC, racE or murC genes were inhibited individually produced 0.54, 0.41, or 0.42 g/L surfactin, respectively. All three genes are related to the metabolism of L-glutamate, whose acylation is the first step in the surfactin condensation reaction. Furthermore, these three genes were repressed in combination, and the strain with co-inhibition of yrpC and racE produced 0.75 g/L surfactin, which was 4.69-fold higher than that of the parent strain. In addition, the inhibition of bkdAA and bkdAB, which are related to the metabolism of L-leucine and L-valine, not only improved surfactin production but also increased the proportion of the C14 isoform.	This study, to the best of our knowledge for the first time, systematically probed the regulatory effect of increasing the supply of amino acids on surfactin production. It provided an effective strategy and a new perspective for systematic studies on surfactin and other amino acid-derived chemicals.	C Wang|Y Cao|Y Wang|L Sun|H Song
31120700	Salmon farming is a key industry in Norway, with firsthand value of more than 60 billion Norwegian crowns in 2017. The salmon industry is a driving force for biotechnological applications in the marine sector. The recent release of the Atlantic salmon reference genome offers new opportunities to solve major aquaculture bottlenecks that currently limit expansion of the industry. One major bottleneck is the genetic impact of escaped farmed salmon on wild populations. To solve this problem, the industry can use sterile salmon in production. As shown byWargelius et al., sterile salmon can be made by preventing the formation of germ cells through genome editing using the CRISPR-Cas9 method. This approach solves problems of genetic introgression and precocious maturation. However, genome editing of animals, especially for human consumption, raises ethical as well as safety and legal questions. These social and ethical aspects can have tremendous impact in analyzing the final result of salmon farming (e.g., consumer acceptability of a fresh or frozen filet or similar salmon product) but also can be examined "upstream" by describing and assessing the research communities that promote and carry out the science that underpins the salmon industry. Who produces the scientific "facts" that govern the Norwegian aquaculture industry? How do these scientific communities work together? What are the societal impacts of this science? This article uses ethnographical observation and interviews to describe the state-of-the-art of CRISPR gene-editing procedures currently employed in the science and industry collaboration in Norway.

31120699	This article discusses the contingencies and complexities of CRISPR. It outlines key problems regarding off-target effects and replication of experimental work that are important to consider in light of CRISPR's touted ease of use and diffusion. In light of literature on the sociotechnical dimensions of the life sciences and biotechnology and literature on former bioweapons programs, this article argues that we need more detailed empirical case studies of the social and technical factors shaping CRISPR and related gene-editing techniques in order to better understand how they may be different from other advances in biotechnology-or whether similar features remain. This information will be critical to better inform intelligence practitioners and policymakers about the security implications of new gene-editing techniques.	KM Vogel|SB Ouagrham-Gormley

31110351	Human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and human induced pluripotent stem cells hold great promise for cell-based therapies and drug discovery. However, homogeneous differentiation remains a major challenge, highlighting the need for understanding developmental mechanisms. We performed genome-scale CRISPR screens to uncover regulators of definitive endoderm (DE) differentiation, which unexpectedly uncovered five Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-JUN family genes as key barriers of DE differentiation. The JNK-JUN pathway does not act through directly inhibiting the DE enhancers. Instead, JUN co-occupies ESC enhancers with OCT4, NANOG, SMAD2 and SMAD3, and specifically inhibits the exit from the pluripotent state by impeding the decommissioning of ESC enhancers and inhibiting the reconfiguration of SMAD2 and SMAD3 chromatin binding from ESC to DE enhancers. Therefore, the JNK-JUN pathway safeguards pluripotency from precocious DE differentiation. Direct pharmacological inhibition of JNK significantly improves the efficiencies of generating DE and DE-derived pancreatic and lung progenitor cells, highlighting the potential of harnessing the knowledge from developmental studies for regenerative medicine.

31110232	The recently developed single-cell CRISPR screening techniques, independently termed Perturb-Seq, CRISP-seq, or CROP-seq, combine pooled CRISPR screening with single-cell RNA-seq to investigate functional CRISPR screening in a single-cell granularity. Here, we present MUSIC, an integrated pipeline for model-based understanding of single-cell CRISPR screening data. Comprehensive tests applied to all the publicly available data revealed that MUSIC accurately quantifies and prioritizes the individual gene perturbation effect on cell phenotypes with tolerance for the substantial noise that exists in such data analysis. MUSIC facilitates the single-cell CRISPR screening from three perspectives, i.e., prioritizing the gene perturbation effect as an overall perturbation effect, in a functional topic-specific way, and quantifying the relationships between different perturbations. In summary, MUSIC provides an effective and applicable solution to elucidate perturbation function and biologic circuits by a model-based quantitative analysis of single-cell-based CRISPR screening data.

31103783	Recent advancements in genetic engineering technology have led to the development of CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) as a precise tool for regulating gene expression. When CRISPR/dCas9 is fused with transcriptional repressors, the system can robustly silence endogenous gene expression. The CRISPR/Cas9 tool is a promising alternative in organisms (e.g., Bombyx mori) that do not respond to traditional gene suppression techniques, such as RNA interference (RNAi). However, transcriptional repressors remain poorly categorized in multiple cell types and species, leading to difficulties in optimizing performance and efficiency. Here, we tested CRISPRi usability and efficiency in Bombyx mori cells (BmE). We fused dCas9 to five transcriptional repressors including KRAB, Hairy, SID, SRDX, and ERD. All five constructs were efficient in BmE cells. In a proof-of-concept experiment, we showed that CRISPRi acting on BmSoxE (a gene involved in cell proliferation) could generate similar phenotypes as RNAi gene suppression. Moreover, CRISPRi has fewer off-target effects. Through co-transfection of BmE cells with sgRNAs, we also demonstrated that dCas9 could simultaneously repress the expression of multiple genes. Furthermore, we identified sgRNA distance from transcriptional start site (TSS) and the dCas9: sgRNA ratio as the two limiting factors of CRISPRi efficiency. Our results demonstrated that CRISPR/dCas9 is a viable and rapid alternative for functional investigations of the B. mori genome and perhaps other Lepidoptera insects.

31099781	The CRISPR/Cas9 nuclease system can effectively suppress the replication of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), while covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), a highly resistant form of the virus, persists in the nuclei of infected cells. The most common outcome of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in cccDNA caused by CRISPR/Cas9 is double-strand break repair by nonhomologous end-joining, which results in insertion/deletion mutations. Modulation of the DNA double-strand break repair pathways by small molecules was shown to stimulate CRISPR/Cas9 activity and may potentially be utilized to enhance the elimination of HBV cccDNA. In this work, we used inhibitors of homologous (RI-1) and nonhomologous (NU7026) end-joining and their combination to stimulate antiviral activity of CRISPR/Cas9 on two cell models of HBV in vitro, i.e., the HepG2-1.1merHBV cells containing the HBV genome under the tet-on regulated cytomegalovirus promoter and the HepG2-1.5merHBV cells containing constitutive expression of HBV RNA under the wild-type promoter. The treatment of the cells with RI-1 or NU7026 after lentiviral transduction of CRISPR/Cas9 drops the levels of cccDNA compared to the DMSO-treated control. RI-1 and NU7026 resulted in 5.0-6.5 times more significant reduction in the HBV cccDNA level compared to the mock-control. In conclusion, the inhibition of both homologous and nonhomologous DNA double-strand break repair pathways increases the elimination of HBV cccDNA by CRISPR/Cas9 system in vitro, which may potentially be utilized as a therapeutic approach to treat chronic hepatitis B.

31099266	Early efforts in cystic fibrosis (CF) gene therapy faced major challenges in delivery efficiency and sustained therapeutic gene expression. Recent advancements in engineered site-specific endonucleases such as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 make permanent CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene correction possible. However, because of safety concerns of the CRISPR/Cas9 system and challenges in in vivo delivery to inflamed CF airway, CRISPR-based gene correction strategies need to be tested in proper animal models. In this study, we aimed at creating vectors for testing CFTR gene correction in pig models. We constructed helper-dependent adenoviral (HD-Ad) vectors to deliver CRISPR/Cas9 and a donor template (a 6 kb LacZ or 8.7 kb human CFTR expression cassette) into cultured pig cells. We demonstrated precise integration of each donor into the GGTA1 safe harbor through Cas9-induced homology directed repair with 3 kb homology arms. In addition, we showed that both LacZ and hCFTR were persistently expressed in transduced cells. Furthermore, we created a CFTR-deficient cell line for testing CFTR correction. We detected hCFTR mRNA and protein expression in cells transduced with the hCFTR vector. We also demonstrated CFTR function in the CF cells transduced with the HD-Ad delivering the CRISPR-Cas9 system and hCFTR donor at late cellular passages using the membrane potential sensitive dye-based assay (FLIPR®). Combined with our previous report on gene delivery to pig airway basal cells, these data provide the feasibility of testing CRISPR/Cas9-mediated permanent human CFTR correction through HD-Ad vector delivery in pigs.

31098740	CRISPR/Cas is an adaptive immune system found in prokaryotes, with the main function of protecting these cells from invasion and possible death by mobile genetic elements. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is considered a model for type I-F CRISPR/Cas system studies. However, its CRISPR loci characteristics have not yet been thoroughly described, and its function has not yet been fully unraveled. The aims of this study were to find the frequency of the system in Brazilian clinical isolates; to identify the loci sequence, its spacer diversity and its origins; as well as to propose a unified spacer library to aid in future structural studies of the CRISPR loci of P. aeruginosa. We investigated types I-F and I-E gene markers to establish CRISPR/Cas typing, and observed two strains harboring both systems simultaneously, a very rare feature. Through amplification and sequencing of CRISPR loci related to type I-F system, we describe polymorphisms in DRs and 350 spacers, of which 97 are new. The spacers that were identified had their possible organisms or proteins of origin identified. Spacer arrays were grouped in five different CRISPR patterns and the plasticity was inferred by rearrangements in spacer arrays. Here, we perform the first detailed and focused description of CRISPR/Cas elements in Brazilian clinical strains of P. aeruginosa. Our findings reflect active and highly diverse CRISPR loci, and we suggest that CRISPR/Cas may also pose as a transcriptional regulatory mechanism. The structural and diversity features described here can provide insights into the function of CRISPR/Cas in this pathogen and help guide the development of new therapeutic strategies.

31090950	Recent waves of controversies surrounding genetic engineering have spilled into popular science in Twitter battles between reputable scientists and their followers.

31088796	The establishment of left-right body asymmetry is a key biological process that is tightly regulated genetically. In the first application of CRISPR/Cas9 to a mollusc, we show decisively that the actin-related diaphanous gene Lsdia1 is the single maternal gene that determines the shell coiling direction of the freshwater snail Lymnaea stagnalis Biallelic frameshift mutations of the gene produced sinistrally coiled offspring generation after generation, in the otherwise totally dextral genetic background. This is the gene sought for over a century. We also show that the gene sets the chirality at the one-cell stage, the earliest observed symmetry-breaking event linked directly to body handedness in the animal kingdom. The early intracellular chirality is superseded by the inter-cellular chirality during the 3rd cleavage, leading to asymmetric nodal and Pitx expression, and then to organismal body handedness. Thus, our findings have important implications for chiromorphogenesis in invertebrates as well as vertebrates, including humans, and for the evolution of snail chirality. This article has an associated 'The people behind the papers' interview.	M Abe|R Kuroda

31080782	Two trypanosomatid species, Lotmaria passim and Crithidia mellificae, have been shown to parasitize honey bees to date. L. passim appears to be more prevalent than C. mellificae and specifically infects the honey bee hindgut. Although the genomic DNA has been sequenced, the effects of infection on honey bee health and colony are poorly understood. To identify the genes that are important for infecting honey bees and to understand their functions, we applied the CRISPR/Cas9 system to establish a method to manipulate L. passim genes. By electroporation of plasmid DNA and subsequent selection by drug, we first established an L. passim clone expressing tdTomato or Cas9. We also successfully disrupted the endogenous miltefosine transporter and tyrosine aminotransferase genes by replacement with drug (hygromycin) resistant gene using the CRISPR/Cas9-induced homology-directed repair pathway. The L. passim clone expressing fluorescent marker, as well as the simple method for editing specific genes, could become useful approaches to understand the underlying mechanisms of honey bee-trypanosomatid parasite interactions.

31076483	Two studies that relied on CRISPR to uncover synthetic lethal targets point to the WRN helicase as a prime candidate. The protein's helicase function is necessary for survival and growth of cancer cells with microsatellite instability. Two other independent studies came to similar conclusions.
31076459	CRISPR-Cas systems are a class of adaptive immune systems in prokaryotes that use small CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) in conjunction with CRISPR-associated (Cas) nucleases to recognize and degrade foreign nucleic acids. Recent studies have revealed that Type III CRISPR-Cas systems synthesize second messenger molecules previously unknown to exist in prokaryotes, cyclic oligoadenylates (cOA). These molecules activate the Csm6 nuclease to promote RNA degradation and may also coordinate additional cellular responses to foreign nucleic acids. Although cOA production has been reconstituted and characterized for a few bacterial and archaeal Type III systems, cOA generation and its regulation have not been explored for the Staphylococcus epidermidis Type III-A CRISPR-Cas system, a longstanding model for CRISPR-Cas function. Here, we demonstrate that this system performs Mg2+-dependent synthesis of 3-6 nt cOA. We show that activation of cOA synthesis is perturbed by single nucleotide mismatches between the crRNA and target RNA at discrete positions, and that synthesis is antagonized by Csm3-mediated target RNA cleavage. Altogether, our results establish the requirements for cOA production in a model Type III CRISPR-Cas system and suggest a natural mechanism to dampen immunity once the foreign RNA is destroyed.

31069270	CRISPR/Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes are promising biological tools with diverse biomedical applications. However, to date there are no efficient methods that can produce these proteins at large scales and low cost. Here, we present a streamlined method for direct production of Cas9 RNPs from Escherichia coli by co-expression of Cas9 and the target-specific single-guided RNAs. Harnessing an ultrahigh-affinity CL7/Im7 purification system recently developed we achieve one-step purification of the self-assembling CRISPR/Cas RNPs, including the commonly used Cas9 and Cas12a, within half a day and with a ~fourfold higher yield than incumbent methods. The prepared Cas RNPs show remarkable stability in the absence of RNase inhibitors, as well as profound gene-editing efficiency in vitro and in vivo. Our method is convenient, cost-effective, and can be used to prepare other CRISPR/Cas RNPs.	J Qiao|W Li|S Lin|W Sun|L Ma|Y Liu
31068592	Gene editing by CRISPR/Cas9 is commonly used to generate germline mutations or perform in vitro screens, but applicability for in vivo screening has so far been limited. Recently, it was shown that in Drosophila, Cas9 expression could be limited to a desired group of cells, allowing tissue-specific mutagenesis. Here, we thoroughly characterize tissue-specific (ts)CRISPR within the complex neuronal system of the Drosophila mushroom body. We report the generation of a library of gRNA-expressing plasmids and fly lines using optimized tools, which provides a valuable resource to the fly community. We demonstrate the application of our library in a large-scale in vivo screen, which reveals insights into developmental neuronal remodeling.

31068009	The announcement of the "CRISPR babies" reignited the debate surrounding the ethical, legal and social implications of germline gene editing. Despite having been conducted in the context of a clinical trial, Dr. Jiankui He's research appears to have violated both Chinese regulations and standard ethical procedures, as well as internationally accepted research and bioethical standards. It is within this context that our commentary surrounding the question of the enforceability of Chinese regulations in such a case. We argue that Chinese regulations do align with internationally accepted standards. Yet, the question remains, in what ways can China strengthen and update its regulatory framework to better address the benefits and challenges associated with emerging technologies, delineate clear enforcement mechanisms and specify criteria for ethics approval.

31062017	A plasmid with a replication initiation region (IR) and a matrix attachment region (MAR) initiates gene amplification in mammalian cells at a random chromosomal location. A mouse artificial chromosome (MAC) vector can stably carry a large genomic region. In this study we combined these two technologies with the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated nuclease (Cas)9 strategy to achieve targeted amplification of a sequence of interest. We previously showed that the IR/MAR plasmid was amplified up to the extrachromosomal tandem repeat; here we demonstrate that cleavage of these tandem plasmids and MAC by Cas9 facilitates homologous recombination between them. The plasmid array on the MAC could be further extended to form a ladder structure with high gene expression by a breakage-fusion-bridge cycle involving breakage at mouse major satellites. Amplification of genes on the MAC has the advantage that the MAC can be transferred between cells. We visualized the MAC in live cells by amplifying the lactose operator array on the MAC in cells expressing lactose repressor-green fluorescent protein fusion protein. This targeted amplification strategy is in theory be applicable to any sequence at any chromosomal site, and provides a novel tool for animal cell technology.

31061828	Tuberculosis remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Even if new antitubercular drugs are currently being developed, the rapid emergence and spread of drug-resistant strain remain a severe challenge. The CRISPR associated proteins 1 (Cas1), a most conserved endonuclease which is responsible for spacer integration into CRISPR arrays, was found deleted in many specific drug-resistant strains. The function of Cas1 is still unknown in Mycobacterium type III-A CRISPR family. In this study, the Cas1 (Rv2817c) defect was found in 57.14% of clinical isolates. To investigate the function of Cas1 in new spacer acquisition, we challenged Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) with a mycobacteriophage D29. Newly acquired spacer sequence matches D29 genome was not found by spacer deep-sequencing. We further expressed Cas1 in recombinant Mycobacterium smegmatis. We found that Cas1 increased the sensitivity to multiple anti-tuberculosis drugs by reducing the persistence during drug treatment. We also showed that Cas1 impaired the repair of DNA damage and changed the stress response of Mycobacterium smegmatis. This study provides a further understanding of Cas1 in Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) drug-resistance evolution and a new sight for the tuberculosis treatment.

31059510	Honey bees are experts at refuting societal norms. Their matriarchal hives are headed by queens, backed by an all-female workforce, and males die soon after copulation. But the biochemical basis of how these distinct castes and sexes (queens, workers, and drones) arise is poorly understood, partly due to a lack of efficient tools for genetic manipulation. Now, Roth and colleagues have used clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) to knock out two key genes (feminizer and doublesex) that guide sexual development. Their technique yielded remarkably low rates of genetic mosaicism and offers a promising tool for engineering and phenotyping bees for diverse applications.	A McAfee|JS Pettis|DR Tarpy|LJ Foster
31058097	Transgenic malaria parasites expressing fluorescent and bioluminescent proteins are valuable tools to interrogate malaria-parasite biology and to evaluate drugs and vaccines. Using CRISPR/Cas9 methodology a transgenic Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) NF54 line was generated that expresses a fusion of mCherry and luciferase genes under the control of the Pf etramp10.3 gene promoter (line mCherry-luc@etramp10.3). Pf etramp10.3 is related to rodent Plasmodium uis4 and the uis4 promoter has been used to drive high transgene expression in rodent parasite sporozoites and liver-stages. We examined transgene expression throughout the complete life cycle and compared this expression to transgenic lines expressing mCherry-luciferase and GFP-luciferase under control of the constitutive gapdh and eef1a promoters. The mCherry-luc@etramp10.3 parasites express mCherry in gametocytes, sporozoites, and liver-stages. While no mCherry signal was detected in asexual blood-stage parasites above background levels, luciferase expression was detected in asexual blood-stages, as well as in gametocytes, sporozoites and liver-stages, with the highest levels of reporter expression detected in stage III-V gametocytes and in sporozoites. The expression of mCherry and luciferase in gametocytes and sporozoites makes this transgenic parasite line suitable to use in in vitro assays that examine the effect of transmission blocking inhibitors and to analyse gametocyte and sporozoite biology.

31051099	The precise control of CRISPR-Cas9 activity is required for a number of genome engineering technologies. Here, we report a generalizable platform that provided the first synthetic small-molecule inhibitors of Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) that weigh <500 Da and are cell permeable, reversible, and stable under physiological conditions. We developed a suite of high-throughput assays for SpCas9 functions, including a primary screening assay for SpCas9 binding to the protospacer adjacent motif, and used these assays to screen a structurally diverse collection of natural-product-like small molecules to ultimately identify compounds that disrupt the SpCas9-DNA interaction. Using these synthetic anti-CRISPR small molecules, we demonstrated dose and temporal control of SpCas9 and catalytically impaired SpCas9 technologies, including transcription activation, and identified a pharmacophore for SpCas9 inhibition using structure-activity relationships. These studies establish a platform for rapidly identifying synthetic, miniature, cell-permeable, and reversible inhibitors against both SpCas9 and next-generation CRISPR-associated nucleases.

31046704	Mutations in the coding region of FOXP2 are known to cause speech and language impairment. However, it is not clear how dysregulation of the gene contributes to language deficit. Interestingly, microdeletions of the region downstream the gene have been associated with cognitive deficits.	Here, we investigate changes in FOXP2 expression in the SK-N-MC neuroblastoma human cell line after deletion by CRISPR-Cas9 of two enhancers located downstream of the gene.	Deletion of any of these two functional enhancers downregulates FOXP2, but also upregulates the closest 3' gene MDFIC. Because this effect is not statistically significant in a HEK 293 cell line, derived from the human kidney, both enhancers might confer a tissue specific regulation to both genes. We have also found that the deletion of any of these enhancers downregulates six well-known FOXP2 target genes in the SK-N-MC cell line.	We expect these findings contribute to a deeper understanding of how FOXP2 and MDFIC are regulated to pace neuronal development supporting cognition, speech and language.

31043479	Malaria remains a major global health issue, affecting millions and killing hundreds of thousands of people annually. Efforts to break the transmission cycle of the causal Plasmodium parasite, and to cure those that are afflicted, rely upon functional characterization of genes essential to the parasite's growth and development. These studies are often based upon manipulations of the parasite genome to disrupt or modify a gene of interest to understand its importance and function. However, these approaches can be limited by the availability of selectable markers and the time required to generate transgenic parasites. Moreover, there also is a risk of disrupting native gene regulatory elements with the introduction of exogenous sequences. To address these limitations, we have developed CRISPR-RGR, a Streptococcus pyogenes (Sp)Cas9-based gene editing system for Plasmodium that utilizes a ribozyme-guide-ribozyme (RGR) single guide RNA (sgRNA) expression strategy with RNA polymerase II promoters. Using rodent-infectious Plasmodium yoelii, we demonstrate that both gene disruptions and coding sequence insertions are efficiently generated, producing marker-free parasites with homology arms as short as 80-100 bp. Additionally, we find that the common practice of using one sgRNA can produce both unintended plasmid integration and desired locus replacement editing events, whereas the use of two sgRNAs results in only locus replacement editing. Lastly, we show that CRISPR-RGR can be used for CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) by binding catalytically dead SpCas9 (dSpCas9) to the region upstream of a gene of interest, resulting in a position-dependent, but strand-independent reduction in gene expression. This robust and flexible system facilitates efficient genetic characterizations of rodent-infectious Plasmodium species.	MP Walker|SE Lindner
31039970	Since its emergence, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated (Cas) 9 system has been increasingly used to generate animals for economically important traits. However, most CRISPR/Cas9 applications have been focused on non-homologous end joining, which results in base deletions and insertions, leading to a functional knockout of the targeted gene. The Booroola fecundity gene (FecBB) mutation (p.Q249R) in bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 1B (BMPR1B) has been demonstrated to exert a profound effect on fecundity in many breeds of sheep. In the present study, we successfully obtained lambs with defined point mutations resulting in a p.249Q>R substitution through the coinjection of Cas9 mRNA, a single guide RNA and single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides into Tan sheep zygotes. In the newborn lambs, the observed efficiency of the single nucleotide exchange was as high as 23.8%. We believe that our findings will contribute to improved reproduction traits in sheep, as well as to the generation of defined point mutations in other large animals.

31039421	To explore whether the Rho protein is involved in the radioresistance of colorectal cancer and investigate the underlying mechanisms.	Rho GTPase expression was measured after radiation treatment in colon cancer cells. RhoB knockout cell lines were established using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. In vitro assays and zebrafish embryos were used for analyzing radiosensitivity and invasive ability. Mass cytometry was used to detect RhoB downstream signaling factors. RhoB and Forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) expression were detected by immunohistochemistry in rectal cancer patients who participated in a radiation therapy trial.	RhoB expression was related to radiation resistance. Complete depletion of the RhoB protein increased radiosensitivity and impaired radiation-enhanced metastatic potential in vitro and in zebrafish models. Probing signaling using mass cytometry-based single-cell analysis showed that the Akt phosphorylation level was inhibited by RhoB depletion after radiation. FOXM1 was downregulated in RhoB knockout cells, and the inhibition of FOXM1 led to lower survival rates and attenuated migration and invasion abilities of the cells after radiation. In the patients who underwent radiation therapy, RhoB overexpression was related to high FOXM1, late Tumor, Node, Metastasis stage, high distant recurrence, and poor survival independent of other clinical factors.	RhoB plays a critical role in radioresistance of colorectal cancer through Akt and FOXM1 pathways.

31039143	The announcement of He Jiankui's germline editing of human embryos has been followed by a torrent of almost universal criticism of the claim on scientific and ethical grounds. That criticism is warranted. There is little room for anything other than vociferous condemnation of He's announcement. Presenting the results of groundbreaking work by press conference and YouTube is not science. The issue now is not whether the work supporting the claims reported from China was done in an ethical manner. It was not. What is required to move forward is a justification for doing germline editing in humans. Many think there is none, and prohibitions abound. If such work is justifiable, a serious, rigorous framework must be imposed that insures that such research is done following the highest ethical standards that both protect human subjects and insure public trust and support.

31036069	Increasing genetic diversity via directed evolution holds great promise to accelerate trait development and crop improvement. We developed a CRISPR/Cas-based directed evolution platform in plants to evolve the rice (Oryza sativa) SF3B1 spliceosomal protein for resistance to splicing inhibitors. SF3B1 mutant variants, termed SF3B1-GEX1A-Resistant (SGR), confer variable levels of resistance to splicing inhibitors. Studies of the structural basis of the splicing inhibitor binding to SGRs corroborate the resistance phenotype. This directed evolution platform can be used to interrogate and evolve the molecular functions of key biomolecules and to engineer crop traits for improved performance and adaptation under climate change conditions.

31030846	The close contact between pets and their owners is a potential source for microorganisms and genetic material exchange. Staphylococcus species considered as harmless inhabitants of animals' and humans' microbiota can act as reservoirs of antimicrobial resistance genes to more virulent species, thereby increasing their potential to resist drug therapy. This process could be inhibited by the antiplasmid immunity conferred by CRISPR systems. On the other hand, CRISPR spacer sequences can be explored as molecular clocks to track the history of genetic invasion suffered by a bacterial strain. To understand better the role of domestic dogs in human health as an antimicrobial resistance genes source, we analyzed 129 genomes of Staphylococcus strains of canine origin for the presence of CRISPR systems. Only 8% of the strains were positive for CRISPR, which is consistent with Staphylococcus role as gene reservoirs. The plasmidial origin or some spacers confirms the unsuccessful attempt of plasmid exchange in strains carrying CRISPRs. Some of these systems are within a staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec), sharing 98% of identity between their harboring strains. These CRISPRs' spacers reveal that this SCCmec was transferred between canine S. pseudintermedius strains, then to S. schleiferi and to Staphylococcus strains isolated from human beings. Our findings shows genetic evidence for the global spreading of pathogenic bacteria and the antimicrobial resistance genes carried by them and reinforce that, in the age of antimicrobial resistance, it is imperative that drug therapies consider the integrated nature of the relationship between pets and humans.

31029079	Salmonella enterica is a major cause of bacterial food-borne disease worldwide. Immunological serotyping is the most commonly used typing method to characterize S. enterica isolates, but is time-consuming and requires expensive reagents. Here, we developed an R package CSESA (CRISPR-based Salmonella enterica Serotype Analyzer) to predict the serotype based on the CRISPR loci of S. enterica.	CSESA has implemented the CRISPR typing method CLSPT and extended its coverage on diverse S. enterica serotypes. This package takes CRISPR sequences or the genome sequences as input and provides users with the predicted serotypes. CSESA has shown excellent performance with currently available sequences of S. enterica.	CSESA is a convenient and useful tool for the prediction of S. enterica serotypes. The application of CSESA package can improve the efficiency of serotyping for S. enterica and reduce the burden of manpower resources.

31023186	Progranulin has multiple functions in several physiological and pathological processes, including embryonic development, wound repair, tumorigenesis, inflammation and neurodegeneration. To investigate the transcriptional regulation of the PGRN gene, a luciferase knock-in reporter system was established in HEK293 cells by integrating luciferase gene in the genome controlled by the endogenous PGRN promoter using CRISPR/Cas9. PCR results demonstrated the site-specific integration of the exogenous luciferase gene into the genome. To validate the novel luciferase knock-in system, a CRISPR/Cas9 transcription activation/repression system for the PGRN gene was constructed and applied to the knock-in system. In addition, phorbol ester (phorbol 12-myristate, 13-acetate), previously reported as activating the expression of PGRN, was applied to the system. The results indicated that luciferase activity was directly correlated with the activity of the PGRN endogenous promoter. This novel system will be a useful tool for investigating the transcriptional regulation of PGRN, and it has great potential in screening the drugs targeting PGRN.	Y Li|S Li|Y Li|H Xia|Q Mao
31022698	Intestinal epithelial cells form a physical barrier that is tightly regulated to control intestinal permeability. Proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, increase epithelial permeability through disruption of epithelial junctions. The regulation of the epithelial barrier in inflammatory gastrointestinal disease remains to be fully characterized. In this article, we show that the human inflammatory bowel disease genetic susceptibility gene C1ORF106 plays a key role in regulating gut epithelial permeability. C1ORF106 directly interacts with cytohesins to maintain functional epithelial cell junctions. C1orf106-deficient mice are hypersensitive to TNF-α-induced increase in epithelial permeability, and this is associated with increased diarrhea. This study identifies C1ORF106 as an epithelial cell junction protein, and the loss of C1ORF106 augments TNF-α-induced intestinal epithelial leakage and diarrhea that may play a critical role in the development of inflammatory bowel disease.

31021236	Bacterial-derived CRISPR-Cas9 nucleases have become a common tool in genome engineering. However, the editing efficiency by even the best-crafted Cas9 nucleases varies considerably with different genomic sites, and efforts to explore the vast natural Cas9 diversity have often met with mixed or little success. Here, we show that modification of the widely used Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 by fusion with chromatin-modulating peptides (CMPs), derived from high mobility group proteins HMGN1 and HMGB1, histone H1, and chromatin remodeling complexes, improves its activity by up to several fold, particularly on refractory target sites. We further show that this CMP fusion strategy (termed CRISPR-chrom) is also effective in improving the activities of smaller Cas9 nucleases from Streptococcus pasteurianus and Campylobacter jejuni, as well as four newly characterized Cas9 orthologs from Bacillus smithii, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Mycoplasma canis, and Parasutterella excrementihominis. Our findings suggest that this CRISPR-chrom strategy can be used to improve established Cas9 nucleases and facilitate exploration of novel Cas9 orthologs for genome modification.

31021235	Genome editing is a tool that has many applications, including the validation of potential drug targets. However, performing genome editing in low-passage primary human cells with the greatest physiological relevance is notoriously difficult. High editing efficiency is desired because it enables gene knockouts (KO) to be generated in bulk cellular populations and circumvents the problem of having to generate clonal cell isolates. Here, we describe a single-step workflow enabling >90% KO generation in primary human lung fibroblasts via CRISPR ribonucleoprotein delivery in the absence of antibiotic selection or clonal expansion. As proof of concept, we edited two SMAD family members and demonstrated that in response to transforming growth factor beta, SMAD3, but not SMAD2, is critical for deposition of type I collagen in the fibrotic response. The optimization of this workflow can be readily transferred to other primary cell types.

31021234	The constant selective pressure exerted by phages, the viruses that infect bacteria, has led to the evolution of a wide range of anti-phage defenses. One of these defense mechanisms, CRISPR-Cas, provides an adaptive immune system to battle phage infection and inhibit horizontal gene transfer by plasmids, transposons, and other mobile genetic elements. Although CRISPR-Cas systems are widespread in bacteria and archaea, they appear to have minimal long-term evolutionary effects with respect to limiting horizontal gene transfer. One factor that may contribute to this may be the presence of potent inhibitors of CRISPR-Cas systems, known as anti-CRISPR proteins. Forty unique families of anti-CRISPR proteins have been described to date. These inhibitors, which are active against both Class 1 and 2 CRISPR-Cas systems, have a wide range of mechanisms of activity. Studies of these proteins have provided important insight into the evolutionary arms race between bacteria and phages, and have contributed to the development of biotechnological tools that can be harnessed for control of CRISPR-Cas genome editing.

31021233	New plant breeding innovations, including CRISPR-mediated genome editing, are enhancing the development of new plant varieties, many of which are on the cusp of entering market places internationally. The lack of clear and consistent regulatory policies globally for genome-edited plants, and their products, may limit the adoption and commercialization of these products; In contrast to the positive trends of regulatory agencies in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, and the United States, which are at the forefront of a wave of countries that are implementing policies facilitating the development of genome-edited plants, the European Union has adopted a more restrictive approach that considers any new mutagenesis technique developed after 2001 as subject to regulation as genetically modified plants.

31020563	DDBJ Fast Annotation and Submission Tool (DFAST) is a genome annotation pipeline for prokaryotes, which also assists data submission to the public sequence database. It is available both as a web service and as a stand-alone tool that runs on local machines. DFAST can annotate a typical-sized bacterial genome within 5 min. The default annotation workflow contains a gene prediction phase for protein coding sequence, rRNA, tRNA, and CRISPR, and a functional annotation phase to infer protein functions. DFAST generates result files in standard annotation formats and data files for submission to DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ). In this chapter, the annotation workflow and applications of DFAST are introduced.	Y Tanizawa|T Fujisawa|M Arita|Y Nakamura

31015259	The simplicity and cost-effectiveness of CRISPR technology have made high-throughput pooled screening approaches accessible to virtually any laboratory. Analyzing the large sequencing data derived from these studies, however, still demands considerable bioinformatics expertise. Various methods have been developed to lessen this requirement, but there are still three tasks for accurate CRISPR screen analysis that involve bioinformatic know-how, if not prowess: designing a proper statistical hypothesis test for robust target identification, developing an accurate mapping algorithm to quantify sgRNA levels, and minimizing the parameters that need to be fine-tuned. To make CRISPR screen analysis more reliable as well as more readily accessible, we have developed a new algorithm, called CRISPRBetaBinomial or CB2 Based on the beta-binomial distribution, which is better suited to sgRNA data, CB2 outperforms the eight most commonly used methods (HiTSelect, MAGeCK, PBNPA, PinAPL-Py, RIGER, RSA, ScreenBEAM, and sgRSEA) in both accurately quantifying sgRNAs and identifying target genes, with greater sensitivity and a much lower false discovery rate. It also accommodates staggered sgRNA sequences. In conjunction with CRISPRcloud, CB2 brings CRISPR screen analysis within reach for a wider community of researchers.

31011186	Multimodal single-cell assays provide high-resolution snapshots of complex cell populations, but are mostly limited to transcriptome plus an additional modality. Here, we describe expanded CRISPR-compatible cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (ECCITE-seq) for the high-throughput characterization of at least five modalities of information from each single cell. We demonstrate application of ECCITE-seq to multimodal CRISPR screens with robust direct single-guide RNA capture and to clonotype-aware multimodal phenotyping of cancer samples.

31010727	The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) system is one of the most powerful tools for genome engineering. However, some of the steps are laborious, reducing its usability. In this study, we have developed a simplified method, called the guide RNA-transient expression system (gRNA-TES), to deliver gRNA in yeast. In gRNA-TES, a DNA fragment containing the promoter and gRNA is prepared by two simple PCR steps and co-transformed with a DNA module into the host strain; all steps including PCR steps and yeast transformation are completed within 5-6 h in a single day, in contrast to conventional plasmid-based gRNA delivery systems, which require at least 3-4 days to construct and verify the gRNA-expressing plasmids. The performance of gRNA-TES was evaluated by the replacement of 150-kb, 200-kb, 300-kb, 400-kb, and 500-kb regions of yeast chromosome 4 with a DNA module. Increased numbers of transformants with a high frequency of expected replacement of even the 500-kb region were obtained with gRNA-TES as compared with transformation without gRNA-TES. In addition, the integrity of the replaced region was verified in 67%-100% of transformants tested by colony PCR. We believe that gRNA-TES will vastly increase the accessibility of CRISPR/Cas9 technology to biologists and biotechnologists by offering a simple, fast, and cost-effective tool to deliver gRNA in genome engineering. Furthermore, it might be applied to plant and animal systems if appropriate gene promoters are incorporated in the technology.	F Easmin|N Hassan|Y Sasano|K Ekino|H Taguchi|S Harashima
31000663	CRISPR-Cas genome editing induces targeted DNA damage but can also affect off-target sites. Current off-target discovery methods work using purified DNA or specific cellular models but are incapable of direct detection in vivo. We developed DISCOVER-Seq (discovery of in situ Cas off-targets and verification by sequencing), a universally applicable approach for unbiased off-target identification that leverages the recruitment of DNA repair factors in cells and organisms. Tracking the precise recruitment of MRE11 uncovers the molecular nature of Cas activity in cells with single-base resolution. DISCOVER-Seq works with multiple guide RNA formats and types of Cas enzymes, allowing characterization of new editing tools. Off-targets can be identified in cell lines and patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells and during adenoviral editing of mice, paving the way for in situ off-target discovery within individual patient genotypes during therapeutic genome editing.

30998096	Much of our understanding of eukaryotic genes function comes from studies of the activity of their mutated forms or allelic variability. Mutations have helped elucidate how members of an intricate pathway function in relation to each other and how they operate in the context of the regulatory circuitry that surrounds them. A PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis technique is often used to engineer these variants. While these tools are efficient, they are not without significant limitations, most notably off-site mutagenesis, limited scalability, and lack of multiplexing capabilities. To overcome many of these limitations, we now describe a novel method for the introduction of both simple and complex gene mutations in plasmid DNA by using in vitro DNA editing. A specifically designed pair of CRISPR-Cas12a ribonucleoprotein complexes are used to execute site-specific double-strand breaks on plasmid DNA, enabling the excision of a defined DNA fragment. Donor DNA replacement is catalyzed by a mammalian cell-free extract through microhomology annealing of short regions of single-stranded DNA complementarity; we term this method CRISPR-directed DNA mutagenesis (CDM). The products of CDM are plasmids bearing precise donor fragments with specific modifications and CDM could be used for mutagenesis in larger constructs such as Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BACs) or Yeast Artificial Chromosome (YACs). We further show that this reaction can be multiplexed so that product molecules with multiple site-specific mutations and site-specific deletions can be generated in the same in vitro reaction mixture. Importantly, the CDM method produces fewer unintended mutations in the target gene as compared to the standard site-directed mutagenesis assay; CDM produces no unintended mutations throughout the plasmid backbone. Lastly, this system recapitulates the multitude of reactions that take place during CRISPR-directed gene editing in mammalian cells and affords the opportunity to study the mechanism of action of CRISPR-directed gene editing in mammalian cells by visualizing a multitude of genetic products.

30998089	Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is defined by focal (involving few glomeruli) and segmental sclerosis of the glomerular tuft that manifests with nephrotic syndrome. Mutations in genes involved in the maintenance of structure and function of podocytes have been found in a minority of these patients. A family with adult-onset autosomal dominant FSGS was recently found to carry a new germline missense heterozygous mutation (p.G189R) in the octapeptide domain of the transcription factor PAX2. Here, we efficiently corrected this point mutation in patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by means of CRISPR-Cas9-based homology-directed repair. The iPSC lines were differentiated into podocytes, which were tested for their motility. Editing the PAX2 p.G189R mutation restored podocyte motility, which was altered in podocytes derived from patient iPSCs.

30996586	To evaluate the efficacy of using a CRISPR/Cas-mediated strategy to correct a common high-risk allele that is associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD; rs1061170; NM_000186.3:c.1204T>C; NP_000177.2:p.His402Tyr) in the complement factor H (CFH) gene.	A human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK293A) was engineered to contain the pathogenic risk variant for AMD (HEK293A-CFH). Several different base editor constructs (BE3, SaBE3, SaKKH-BE3, VQR-BE3, and Target-AID) and their respective single-guide RNA (sgRNA) expression cassettes targeting either the pathogenic risk variant allele in the CFH locus or the LacZ gene, as a negative control, were evaluated head-to-head for the incidence of a cytosine-to-thymine nucleotide correction. The base editor construct that showed appreciable editing activity was selected for further assessment in which the base-edited region was subjected to next-generation deep sequencing to quantify on-target and off-target editing efficacy.	The tandem use of the Target-AID base editor and its respective sgRNA demonstrated a base editing efficiency of facilitating a cytosine-to-thymine nucleotide correction in 21.5% of the total sequencing reads. Additionally, the incidence of insertions and deletions (indels) was detected in only 0.15% of the sequencing reads with virtually no off-target effects evident across the top 11 predicted off-target sites containing at least one cytosine in the activity window (n = 3, pooled amplicons).	CRISPR-mediated base editing can be used to facilitate a permanent and stably inherited cytosine-to-thymine nucleotide correction of the rs1061170 SNP in the CFH gene with minimal off-target effects.

30993331	Screening of genomic and metagenomic databases for new variants of CRISPR-Cas systems increasingly results in the discovery of derived variants that do not seem to possess the interference capacity and are implicated in functions distinct from adaptive immunity. We describe an extremely derived putative class 1 CRISPR-Cas system that is present in many Halobacteria and consists of distant homologs of the Cas5 and Cas7 protein along with an uncharacterized conserved protein and various nucleases. We hypothesize that, although this system lacks typical CRISPR effectors or a CRISPR array, it functions as a RNA-dependent defense mechanism that, unlike other derived CRISPR-Cas, utilizes alternative nucleases to cleave invader genomes.

30992567	Understanding the mechanism of small molecules is a critical challenge in chemical biology and drug discovery. Medicinal chemistry is essential for elucidating drug mechanism, enabling variation of small molecule structure to gain structure-activity relationships (SARs). However, the development of complementary approaches that systematically vary target protein structure could provide equally informative SARs for investigating drug mechanism and protein function. Here we explore the ability of CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis to profile the interactions between lysine-specific histone demethylase 1 (LSD1) and chemical inhibitors in the context of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Through this approach, termed CRISPR-suppressor scanning, we elucidate drug mechanism of action by showing that LSD1 enzyme activity is not required for AML survival and that LSD1 inhibitors instead function by disrupting interactions between LSD1 and the transcription factor GFI1B on chromatin. Our studies clarify how LSD1 inhibitors mechanistically operate in AML and demonstrate how CRISPR-suppressor scanning can uncover novel aspects of target biology.

30992277	Eyespots on the wings of nymphalid butterflies represent colorful examples of pattern formation, yet the developmental origins and mechanisms underlying eyespot center differentiation are still poorly understood. Using CRISPR-Cas9 we re-examine the function of Distal-less (Dll) as an activator or repressor of eyespots, a topic that remains controversial. We show that the phenotypic outcome of CRISPR mutations depends upon which specific exon is targeted. In Bicyclus anynana, exon 2 mutations are associated with both missing and ectopic eyespots, and also exon skipping. Exon 3 mutations, which do not lead to exon skipping, produce only null phenotypes, including missing eyespots, lighter wing coloration and loss of scales. Reaction-diffusion modeling of Dll function, using Wnt and Dpp as candidate morphogens, accurately replicates these complex crispant phenotypes. These results provide new insight into the function of Dll as a potential activator of eyespot development, scale growth and melanization, and suggest that the tuning of Dll expression levels can generate a diversity of eyespot phenotypes, including their appearance on the wing.This article has an associated 'The people behind the papers' interview.

30991845	Plants exposed to hostile environmental conditions such as drought or extreme temperatures usually undergo oxidative stress, which has long been assumed to significantly contribute to the damage suffered by the organism. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduced under stress conditions were proposed to destroy membrane lipids and to inactivate proteins and photosystems, ultimately leading to cell death. Accordingly, considerable effort has been devoted, over the years, to improve stress tolerance by strengthening antioxidant and dissipative mechanisms. Although the notion that ROS cause indiscriminate damage in vivo has been progressively replaced by the alternate concept that they act as signaling molecules directing critical plant developmental and environmental responses including cell death, the induction of genes encoding antioxidant activities is commonplace under many environmental stresses, suggesting that their manipulation still offers promise. The features and consequences of ROS effects depend on the balance between various interacting pathways including ROS synthesis and scavenging, energy dissipation, conjugative reactions, and eventually reductive repair. They represent many possibilities for genetic manipulation. We report, herein, a comprehensive survey of transgenic plants in which components of the ROS-associated pathways were overexpressed, and of the stress phenotypes displayed by the corresponding transformants. Genetic engineering of different stages of ROS metabolism such as synthesis, scavenging, and reductive repair revealed a strong correlation between down-regulation of ROS levels and increased stress tolerance in plants grown under controlled conditions. Field assays are scarce, and are eagerly required to assess the possible application of this strategy to agriculture.	R Gómez|P Vicino|N Carrillo|AF Lodeyro
30985763	CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF)-mediated stable topologically associating domains (TADs) play a critical role in constraining interactions of DNA elements that are located in neighboring TADs. CTCF plays an important role in regulating the spatial and temporal expression of HOX genes that control embryonic development, body patterning, hematopoiesis, and leukemogenesis. However, it remains largely unknown whether and how HOX loci associated CTCF boundaries regulate chromatin organization and HOX gene expression. In the current protocol, a specific sgRNA pooled library targeting all CTCF binding sites in the HOXA/B/C/D loci has been generated to examine the effects of disrupting CTCF-associated chromatin boundaries on TAD formation and HOX gene expression. Through CRISPR-Cas9 genetic screening, the CTCF binding site located between HOXA7/HOXA9 genes (CBS7/9) has been identified as a critical regulator of oncogenic chromatin domain, as well as being important for maintaining ectopic HOX gene expression patterns in MLL-rearranged acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Thus, this sgRNA library screening approach provides novel insights into CTCF mediated genome organization in specific gene loci and also provides a basis for the functional characterization of the annotated genetic regulatory elements, both coding and noncoding, during normal biological processes in the post-human genome project era.

30981829	Bi-allelic mutations in the glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA1) cause Gaucher's disease, the most common human lysosomal storage disease. We previously reported a marked increase in miR-155 transcript levels and early microglial activation in a zebrafish model of Gaucher's disease (gba1-/-). miR-155 is a master regulator of inflammation and has been implicated in a wide range of different neurodegenerative disorders. The observed miR-155 upregulation preceded the subsequent development of widespread pathology with marked neuroinflammation, closely resembling human Gaucher's disease pathology. We now report similar increases of miR-155 expression in mammalian models of GD, confirming that miR-155 upregulation is a shared feature in glucocerebrosidase (GCase) deficiency across different species. Using CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis we then generated a miR-155 mutant zebrafish line (miR-155-/-) with completely abolished miR-155 expression. Unexpectedly, loss of miR-155 did not mitigate either the reduced lifespan or the robust inflammatory phenotypes of gba1-/- mutant zebrafish. Our data demonstrate that neither neuroinflammation nor disease progression in GCase deficiency are dependent on miR-155 and suggest that miR-155 inhibition would not be a promising therapeutic target in Gaucher's disease.

30979834	Many genes in the bacterial pathogen Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of three plague pandemics, remain uncharacterized, greatly hampering the development of measures for plague prevention and control. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat interference (CRISPRi) has been shown to be an effective tool for gene knockdown in model bacteria. In this system, a catalytically dead Cas9 (dCas9) and a small guide RNA (sgRNA) form a complex, binding to the specific DNA target through base pairing, thereby impeding RNA polymerase binding and causing target gene repression. Here, we introduce an optimized CRISPRi system using Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9-derived dCas9 for gene knockdown in Y. pestis Multiple genes harbored on either the chromosome or plasmids of Y. pestis were efficiently knocked down (up to 380-fold) in a strictly anhydrotetracycline-inducible manner using this CRISPRi approach. Knockdown of hmsH (responsible for biofilm formation) or cspB (encoding a cold shock protein) resulted in greatly decreased biofilm formation or impaired cold tolerance in in vitro phenotypic assays. Furthermore, silencing of the virulence-associated genes yscB or ail using this CRISPRi system resulted in attenuation of virulence in HeLa cells and mice similar to that previously reported for yscB and ail null mutants. Taken together, our results confirm that this optimized CRISPRi system can reversibly and efficiently repress the expression of target genes in Y. pestis, providing an alternative to conventional gene knockdown techniques, as well as a strategy for high-throughput phenotypic screening of Y. pestis genes with unknown functions.IMPORTANCEYersiniapestis is a lethal pathogen responsible for millions of human deaths in history. It has also attracted much attention for potential uses as a bioweapon or bioterrorism agent, against which new vaccines are desperately needed. However, many Y. pestis genes remain uncharacterized, greatly hampering the development of measures for plague prevention and control. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat interference (CRISPRi) has been successfully used in a variety of bacteria in functional genomic studies, but no such genetic tool has been reported in Y. pestis Here, we systematically optimized the CRISPRi approach for use in Y. pestis, which ultimately repressed target gene expression with high efficiency in a reversible manner. Knockdown of functional genes using this method produced phenotypes that were readily detected by in vitro assays, cell infection assays, and mouse infection experiments. This is a report of a CRISPRi approach in Y. pestis and highlights the potential use of this approach in high-throughput functional genomics studies of this pathogen.

30979825	Genetic interactions mediate the emergence of phenotype from genotype. The systematic survey of genetic interactions in yeast showed that genes operating in the same biological process have highly correlated genetic interaction profiles, and this observation has been exploited to infer gene function in model organisms. Such assays of digenic perturbations in human cells are also highly informative, but are not scalable, even with CRISPR-mediated methods. As an alternative, we developed an indirect method of deriving functional interactions. We show that genes having correlated knockout fitness profiles across diverse, non-isogenic cell lines are analogous to genes having correlated genetic interaction profiles across isogenic query strains and similarly imply shared biological function. We constructed a network of genes with correlated fitness profiles across 276 high-quality CRISPR knockout screens in cancer cell lines into a "coessentiality network," with up to 500-fold enrichment for co-functional gene pairs, enabling strong inference of gene function and highlighting the modular organization of the cell.

30978482	Multiplex genome editing involves the simultaneous targeting of multiple related or unrelated targets. The latter is most straightforward using the CRISPR/Cas9 system because multiple gRNAs can be delivered either as independent expression cassettes with their own promoters or as polycistronic transcripts processed into mature gRNAs by endogenous or introduced nucleases. Multiplex genome editing in plants initially focused on input traits such as herbicide resistance, but has recently expanded to include hormone biosynthesis and perception, metabolic engineering, plant development and molecular farming, with more than 100 simultaneous targeting events reported. Usually the coding region is targeted but recent examples also include promoter modifications to generate mutants with varying levels of gene expression.	V Armario Najera|RM Twyman|P Christou|C Zhu
30976097	CRISPR is often called one of the century's most important discoveries and is commonly discussed in terms of its momentous potential impacts. This study analyzed how CRISPR is discussed in the North American popular press, including how it is defined, and which benefits and risks/concerns are attributed to the technology.	Using the Factiva database, we identified 228 relevant, nonduplicated articles containing either "CRISPR" or "C.R.I.S.P.R.," published in popular US and Canadian news sources between 1 January 2012 and 12 July 2017. Content analysis was performed on the articles.	CRISPR is most often discussed in the context of human health (83.8%), compared with animals (26.3%) and plants (20.6%). Nearly all articles (96.1%) presented CRISPR's potential benefits; 61.4% of articles presented CRISPR-related risks/concerns, the vast majority of which focused on the uncertainty surrounding CRISPR, specifically with respect to germline modifications.	Overall, the discourse suggests a strong promotion of CRISPR, but an element of caution is also evident. Technical as well as ethical, legal, and social risks/concerns play a prominent role. This media portrayal of CRISPR might help facilitate more sophisticated and balanced policy responses, where the scientific potential of the technology is highlighted alongside broader social considerations.

30973327	The deactivated CRISPR/Cas9 (dCas9) is now the most widely used gene activator. However, current dCas9-based gene activators are still limited by their unsatisfactory activity. In this study, we developed a new strategy, the CRISPR-assisted trans enhancer, for activating gene expression at high efficiency by combining dCas9-VP64/sgRNA with the widely used strong CMV enhancer. In this strategy, CMV enhancer DNA was recruited to target genes in trans by two systems: dCas9-VP64/csgRNA-sCMV and dCas9-VP64-GAL4/sgRNA-UAS-CMV. The former recruited trans enhancer by annealing between two short complementary oligonucleotides at the ends of the sgRNA and trans enhancer. The latter recruited trans enhancer by binding between GAL4 fused to dCas9 and UAS sequence of trans enhancer. The trans enhancer activated gene transcription as the natural looped cis enhancer. The trans enhancer could activate both exogenous reporter genes and variant endogenous genes in various cells, with much higher activation efficiency than that of current dCas9 activators.

30972304	Drug tolerance in mycobacterial pathogens is a global concern. Fluoroquinolone (FQ) treatment is widely used for induction of persisters in bacteria. Although FQs that target DNA gyrase are currently used as second-line anti-tuberculosis (TB) drugs, little is known about their impact on Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) persister formation. Here we explored the CRISPRi-based genetic repression for better understanding the effect of DNA gyrase depletion on Mtb physiology and response to anti-TB drugs. We find that suppression of DNA gyrase drastically affects intra- and extracellular growth of Mtb. Interestingly, gyrase depletion in Mtb leads to activation of RecA/LexA-mediated SOS response and drug tolerance via induction of persister subpopulation. Chemical inhibition of RecA in gyrase-depleted bacteria results in reversion of persister phenotype and better killing by antibiotics. This study provides evidence that inhibition of SOS response can be advantageous in improving the efficacy of anti-TB drugs and shortening the duration of current TB treatment.

30968001	Despite the fact that great efforts have been made in the prevention and therapy of HIV-1 infection, HIV-1/AIDS remains a major threat to global human health. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) can suppress virus replication, but it cannot eradicate latent viral reservoirs in HIV-1/AIDS patients. Recently, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated nuclease 9 (Cas9) system has been engineered as an effective gene-editing technology with the potential to treat HIV-1/AIDS. It can be used to target cellular co-factors or HIV-1 genome to reduce HIV-1 infection and clear the provirus, as well as to induce transcriptional activation of latent virus in latent viral reservoirs for elimination. This versatile gene editing technology has been successfully applied to HIV-1/AIDS prevention and reduction in human cells and animal models. Here, we update the rapid progress of CRISPR/Cas9-based HIV-1/AIDS therapy research in recent years and discuss the limitations and future perspectives of its application.	Q Xiao|D Guo|S Chen

30962569	The fast-growing Gram-negative bacterium Vibrio natriegens is an attractive microbial system for molecular biology and biotechnology due to its remarkably short generation time1,2 and metabolic prowess3,4. However, efforts to uncover and utilize the mechanisms underlying its rapid growth are hampered by the scarcity of functional genomic data. Here, we develop a pooled genome-wide clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) interference (CRISPRi) screen to identify a minimal set of genes required for rapid wild-type growth. Targeting 4,565 (99.7%) of predicted protein-coding genes, our screen uncovered core genes comprising putative essential and growth-supporting genes that are enriched for respiratory pathways. We found that 96% of core genes were located on the larger chromosome 1, with growth-neutral duplicates of core genes located primarily on chromosome 2. Our screen also refines metabolic pathway annotations by distinguishing functional biosynthetic enzymes from those predicted on the basis of comparative genomics. Taken together, this work provides a broadly applicable platform for high-throughput functional genomics to accelerate biological studies and engineering of V. natriegens.

30957847	Recent studies on CRISPR adaptation revealed that priming is a major pathway of spacer acquisition, at least for the most prevalent type I systems. Priming is guided by a CRISPR RNA which fully/partially matches the invader DNA, but the plasticity of this RNA guide has not yet been characterized. In this study, we extensively modified the two conserved handles of a priming crRNA in Haloarcula hispanica, and altered the size of its central spacer part. Interestingly, priming is insusceptible to the full deletion of 3' handle, which seriously impaired crRNA stability and interference effects. With 3' handle deletion, further truncation of 5' handle revealed that its spacer-proximal 6 nucleotides could provide the least conserved sequence required for priming. Subsequent scanning mutation further identified critical nucleotides within 5' handle. Besides, priming was also shown to tolerate a wider size variation of the spacer part, compared to interference. These data collectively illustrate the high tolerance of priming to extensive structural/size variations of the crRNA guide, which highlights the structural flexibility of the crRNA-effector ribonucleoprotein complex. The observed high priming effectiveness suggests that primed adaptation promotes clearance of the fast-replicating and ever-evolving viral DNA, by rapidly and persistently multiplexing the interference pathway.

30955891	Normal tissues accumulate genetic changes with age, but it is unknown if somatic mutations promote clonal expansion of non-malignant cells in the setting of chronic degenerative diseases. Exome sequencing of diseased liver samples from 82 patients revealed a complex mutational landscape in cirrhosis. Additional ultra-deep sequencing identified recurrent mutations in PKD1, PPARGC1B, KMT2D, and ARID1A. The number and size of mutant clones increased as a function of fibrosis stage and tissue damage. To interrogate the functional impact of mutated genes, a pooled in vivo CRISPR screening approach was established. In agreement with sequencing results, examination of 147 genes again revealed that loss of Pkd1, Kmt2d, and Arid1a promoted clonal expansion. Conditional heterozygous deletion of these genes in mice was also hepatoprotective in injury assays. Pre-malignant somatic alterations are often viewed through the lens of cancer, but we show that mutations can promote regeneration, likely independent of carcinogenesis.

30951810	Industrial biotechnology is reliant on native pathway engineering or foreign pathway introduction for efficient biosynthesis of target products. Chromosomal integration, with intrinsic genetic stability, is an indispensable step for reliable expression of homologous or heterologous genes and pathways in large-scale and long-term fermentation. With advances in synthetic biology and CRISPR-based genome editing approaches, a wide variety of novel enabling technologies have been developed for single-step, markerless, multi-locus genomic integration of large biochemical pathways, which significantly facilitate microbial overproduction of chemicals, pharmaceuticals and other value-added biomolecules. Notably, the newly discovered homology-mediated end joining strategy could be widely applicable for high-efficiency genomic integration in a number of homologous recombination-deficient microbes. In this review, we explore the fundamental principles and characteristics of genomic integration, and highlight the development and applications of targeted integration approaches in the three representative industrial microbial systems, including Escherichia coli, actinomycetes and yeasts.

Here, we demonstrate that intracranial injection of CRISPR-Gold, a nonviral delivery vehicle for the CRISPR-Cas9 ribonucleoprotein, can edit genes in the brains of adult mice in multiple mouse models. CRISPR-Gold can deliver both Cas9 and Cpf1 ribonucleoproteins, and can edit all of the major cell types in the brain, including neurons, astrocytes and microglia, with undetectable levels of toxicity at the doses used. We also show that CRISPR-Gold designed to target the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) gene can efficiently reduce local mGluR5 levels in the striatum after an intracranial injection. The effect can also rescue mice from the exaggerated repetitive behaviours caused by fragile X syndrome, a common single-gene form of autism spectrum disorders. CRISPR-Gold may significantly accelerate the development of brain-targeted therapeutics and enable the rapid development of focal brain-knockout animal models.

30944210	Elizabethkingia anophelis is an emerging global multidrug-resistant opportunistic pathogen. We assessed the diversity among 13 complete genomes and 23 draft genomes of E. anophelis strains derived from various environmental settings and human infections from different geographic regions around the world from 1950s to the present. Putative integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs) were identified in 31/36 (86.1%) strains in the study. A total of 52 putative ICEs (including eight degenerated elements lacking integrases) were identified and categorized into three types based on the architecture of the conjugation module and the phylogeny of the relaxase, coupling protein, TraG, and TraJ protein sequences. The type II and III ICEs were found to integrate adjacent to tRNA genes, while type I ICEs integrate into intergenic regions or into a gene. The ICEs carry various cargo genes, including transcription regulator genes and genes conferring antibiotic resistance. The adaptive immune CRISPR-Cas system was found in nine strains, including five strains in which CRISPR-Cas machinery and ICEs coexist at different locations on the same chromosome. One ICE-derived spacer was present in the CRISPR locus in one strain. ICE distribution in the strains showed no geographic or temporal patterns. The ICEs in E. anophelis differ in architecture and sequence from CTnDOT, a well-studied ICE prevalent in Bacteroides spp. The categorization of ICEs will facilitate further investigations of the impact of ICE on virulence, genome epidemiology, and adaptive genomics of E. anophelisIMPORTANCEElizabethkingia anophelis is an opportunistic human pathogen, and the genetic diversity between strains from around the world becomes apparent as more genomes are sequenced. Genome comparison identified three types of putative ICEs in 31 of 36 strains. The diversity of ICEs suggests that they had different origins. One of the ICEs was discovered previously from a large E. anophelis outbreak in Wisconsin in the United States; this ICE has integrated into the mutY gene of the outbreak strain, creating a mutator phenotype. Similar to ICEs found in many bacterial species, ICEs in E. anophelis carry various cargo genes that enable recipients to resist antibiotics and adapt to various ecological niches. The adaptive immune CRISPR-Cas system is present in nine of 36 strains. An ICE-derived spacer was found in the CRISPR locus in a strain that has no ICE, suggesting a past encounter and effective defense against ICE.	J Xu|D Pei|A Nicholson|Y Lan|Q Xia
30941642	CRISPR technology has vividly increased its applications in last five years for genome editing in a wide range of organisms from bacteria to plants. It is mostly applied in the field of mammalian research. This emerging versatile tool can be utilized in crop improvement by targeting various traits to increase economic value and adaptability of the crop species under changing climate. In plants, Arabidopsis and rice are the most studied plant species in genome editing through CRISPR technology. Wheat is lagging behind in the utilization of CRISPR based genome modifications. The hexaploid, large genome size and the recalcitrant nature in terms of tissue culture are the major obstacles for CRISPR utilization in wheat. Recently, the IWGSC released the high quality of reference genome for wheat which will greatly accelerate the application of CRISPR-based genome engineering in wheat and helps to resolve the global issue of food security in coming decades. The exogenous DNA-free improved mutants with CRISPR technology having desired traits will increase the productivity under biotic and abiotic stress conditions. To address complex traits involving multigene, recently developed multiplex genome editing toolkits can be used. This is a first review of its kind in which the practical utilization and updates on CRISPR validation in wheat along with its future prospects for use of this technology in wheat improvement are comprehensively discussed. Thus, the compiled information will immensely benefit the researchers for utilization of CRISPR system in wheat improvement across the globe.	R Kumar|A Kaur|A Pandey|HM Mamrutha|GP Singh

The EGFP cassettes were specifically knocked into the Gγ gene. EGFP expression was detected in the targeted cell population and isolated clones. Furthermore, EGFP transcript and fluorescence levels were significantly induced following HU-treatment.	This system is readily utilizable for genome scale studies of cis-acting regulatory elements which are implicated in γ-globin expression or HU-mediated induction.

30940138	Non-conventional yeasts are playing important roles as cell factories for bioproduction of biofuels, food additives and proteins with outstanding natural characteristics. However, the precise genome editing is challenging in non-conventional yeasts due to lack of efficient genetic tools. In the past few years, CRISPR-based genome editing worked as a revolutionary tool for genetic engineering and showed great advantages in cellular metabolic engineering. Here, we review the current advances and barriers of CRISPR-Cas9 for genome editing in non-conventional yeasts and propose the possible solutions in enhancing its efficiency for precise genetic engineering.

30938974	Interleukin-17A (IL17A) plays a critical role in the development of numerous autoimmune diseases, including psoriasis. The clinical success of IL17A neutralizing biologics in psoriasis has underlined its importance as a drug discovery target. While many studies have focused on the differentiation and trafficking of IL17A producing T-helper 17 cells, less is known about IL17A-initiated signaling events in stromal and parenchymal cells leading to psoriatic phenotypes. We sought to discover signaling nodes downstream of IL17A contributing to disease pathogenesis. Using IL17A and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF) to stimulate primary human epidermal keratinocytes, we employed two different phenotypic screening approaches. First, a library of ∼22000 annotated compounds was screened for reduced secretion of the pro-inflammatory chemokine IL8. Second, a library of 729 kinases was screened in a pooled format by utilizing CRISPR-Cas9 and monitoring IL8 intracellular staining. The highest-ranking novel hits identified in both screens were the bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) family proteins and bromodomain-containing protein 2 (BRD2), respectively. Comparison of BRD2, BRD3, and BRD4 silencing with siRNA and CRISPR confirmed that BRD2 was responsible for mediating IL8 production. Pan-BRD inhibitors and BRD2 knockout also reduced IL17A/TNF-mediated CXC motif chemokines 1/2/6 (CXCL1/2/6) and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) production. In RNA-Seq analysis, 438 IL17A/TNF dependent genes were reduced in BRD2-deficient primary keratinocytes. KEGG pathway analysis of these genes showed enrichment in TNF signaling and rheumatoid arthritis relevant genes. Moreover, a number of genes important for keratinocyte homeostasis and cornification were dysregulated in BRD2-deficient keratinocytes. In IL17A/TNF/IL22 stimulated three-dimensional organotypic raft cultures, pan-BRD inhibition reduced inflammatory factor production but elicited aberrant cornification, consistent with RNA-Seq analysis. These studies highlight a novel role for BRDs and BRD2 in particular in IL17A-mediated inflammatory signaling.

30936372	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas systems incorporate short DNA fragments from invasive genetic elements into host CRISPR arrays in order to generate host immunity. Recently, we demonstrated that the Csa3a regulator protein triggers CCN protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM)-dependent CRISPR spacer acquisition in the subtype I-A CRISPR-Cas system of Sulfolobus islandicus However, the mechanisms underlying specific protospacer selection and spacer insertion remained unclear. Here, we demonstrate that two Cas4 family proteins (Cas4 and Csa1) have essential roles (i) in recognizing the 5' PAM and 3' nucleotide motif of protospacers and (ii) in determining both the spacer length and its orientation. Furthermore, we identify amino acid residues of the Cas4 proteins that facilitate these functions. Overexpression of the Cas4 and Csa1 proteins, and also that of an archaeal virus-encoded Cas4 protein, resulted in strongly reduced adaptation efficiency, and the former proteins yielded a high incidence of PAM-dependent atypical spacer integration or of PAM-independent spacer integration. We further demonstrated that in plasmid challenge experiments, overexpressed Cas4-mediated defective spacer acquisition in turn potentially enabled targeted DNA to escape subtype I-A CRISPR-Cas interference. In summary, these results define the specific involvement of diverse Cas4 proteins in in vivo CRISPR spacer acquisition. Furthermore, we provide support for an anti-CRISPR role for virus-encoded Cas4 proteins that involves compromising CRISPR-Cas interference activity by hindering spacer acquisition.IMPORTANCE The Cas4 family endonuclease is an essential component of the adaptation module in many variants of CRISPR-Cas adaptive immunity systems. The CrenarchaeotaSulfolobus islandicus REY15A carries two cas4 genes (cas4 and csa1) linked to the CRISPR arrays. Here, we demonstrate that Cas4 and Csa1 are essential to CRISPR spacer acquisition in this organism. Both proteins specify the upstream and downstream conserved nucleotide motifs of the protospacers and define the spacer length and orientation in the acquisition process. Conserved amino acid residues, in addition to those recently reported, were identified to be important for these functions. More importantly, overexpression of the Sulfolobus viral Cas4 abolished spacer acquisition, providing support for an anti-CRISPR role for virus-encoded Cas4 proteins that inhibit spacer acquisition.

30929208	Sequence-specific knockdown of gene expression using CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) has recently been developed for Streptococcus pneumoniae. By coexpression of a catalytically inactive Cas9-protein (dCas9) and a single guide RNA (sgRNA), CRISPRi can be used to knock down transcription of any gene of interest. Gene specificity is mediated by a 20 bp sequence on the sgRNA, and new genes can be targeted by replacing this 20 bp sequence. Here, a protocol is provided for design of sgRNAs and construction of CRIPSRi strains in S. pneumoniae, based on the vectors published by Liu et al. (Mol Syst Biol 13:931, 2017).	M Kjos
30928637	Two recently engineered SpCas9 variants, namely xCas9 and Cas9-NG, show promising potential in improving targeting specificity and broadening the targeting range. In this study, we evaluated these Cas9 variants in the model and crop plant, rice. We first tested xCas9-3.7, the most effective xCas9 variant in mammalian cells, for targeted mutagenesis at 16 possible NGN PAM (protospacer adjacent motif) combinations in duplicates. xCas9 exhibited nearly equivalent editing efficiency to wild-type Cas9 (Cas9-WT) at most canonical NGG PAM sites tested, whereas it showed limited activity at non-canonical NGH (H = A, C, T) PAM sites. High editing efficiency of xCas9 at NGG PAMs was further demonstrated with C to T base editing by both rAPOBEC1 and PmCDA1 cytidine deaminases. With mismatched sgRNAs, we found that xCas9 had improved targeting specificity over the Cas9-WT. Furthermore, we tested two Cas9-NG variants, Cas9-NGv1 and Cas9-NG, for targeting NGN PAMs. Both Cas9-NG variants showed higher editing efficiency at most non-canonical NG PAM sites tested, and enabled much more efficient editing than xCas9 at AT-rich PAM sites such as GAT, GAA, and CAA. Nevertheless, we found that Cas9-NG variants showed significant reduced activity at the canonical NGG PAM sites. In stable transgenic rice lines, we demonstrated that Cas9-NG had much higher editing efficiency than Cas9-NGv1 and xCas9 at NG PAM sites. To expand the base-editing scope, we developed an efficient C to T base-editing system by making fusion of Cas9-NG nickase (D10A version), PmCDA1, and UGI. Taken together, our work benchmarked xCas9 as a high-fidelity nuclease for targeting canonical NGG PAMs and Cas9-NG as a preferred variant for targeting relaxed PAMs for plant genome editing.

30928636	CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing relies on sgRNA-target DNA base pairing and a short downstream PAM sequence to recognize target DNA. The strict protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) requirement hinders applications of the CRISPR/Cas9 system since it restricts the targetable sites in the genomes. xCas9 and SpCas9-NG are two recently engineered SpCas9 variants that can recognize more relaxed NG PAMs, implying a great potential in addressing the issue of PAM constraint. Here we use stable transgenic lines to evaluate the efficacies of xCas9 and SpCas9-NG in performing gene editing and base editing in rice. We found that xCas9 can efficiently induce mutations at target sites with NG and GAT PAM sequences in rice. However, base editors containing xCas9 failed to edit most of the tested target sites. SpCas9-NG exhibited a robust editing activity at sites with various NG PAMs without showing any preference for the third nucleotide after NG. Moreover, we showed that xCas9 and SpCas9-NG have higher specificity than SpCas9 at the CGG PAM site. We further demonstrated that different forms of cytosine or adenine base editors containing SpCas9-NG worked efficiently in rice with broadened PAM compatibility. Taken together, our work has yielded versatile genome-engineering tools that will significantly expand the target scope in rice and other crops.	K Hua|X Tao|P Han|R Wang|JK Zhu
30928635	CRISPR technologies enabling precise genome manipulation are valuable for gene function studies and molecular crop breeding. However, the requirement of a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), such as NGG and TTN, for Cas protein recognition restricts the selection of targetable genomic loci in practical applications of CRISPR technologies. Recently Cas9-NG, which recognizes a minimal NG PAM, was reported to expand the targeting space of genome editing in human cells, but it remains unclear whether this Cas9 variant can be used in plants. In this study, we evaluated the nuclease activity of Cas9-NG toward various NGN PAMs by targeting endogenous genes in transgenic rice. We found that Cas9-NG edits all NGG, NGA, NGT, and NGC sites with impaired activity, while the gene-edited plants were dominated by monoallelic mutations. Cas9-NG-engineered base editors were then developed and used to generate OsBZR1 gain-of-function plants that can not be created by other available Cas9-engineered base editors. Moreover, we showed that a Cas9-NG-based transcriptional activator efficiently upregulated the expression of endogenous target genes in rice. In addition, we discovered that Cas9-NG recognizes NAC, NTG, NTT, and NCG apart from NG PAM. Together, these findings demonstrate that Cas9-NG can greatly expand the targeting scope of genome-editing tools, showing great potential for targeted genome editing, base editing, and genome regulation in plants.

30926729	Methanotrophic bacteria play a crucial role in the Earth's biogeochemical cycle and have the potential to be employed in industrial biomanufacturing processes due to their capacity to use natural gas- and biogas-derived methane as a sole carbon and energy source. Advanced gene-editing systems have the potential to enable rapid, high-throughput methanotrophic genetics and biocatalyst development. To this end, we employed a series of broad-host-range expression plasmids to construct a conjugatable clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 gene-editing system in Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath). Heterologous coexpression of the Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 endonuclease and a synthetic single guide RNA (gRNA) showed efficient Cas9 DNA targeting and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) cleavage that resulted in cell death. We demonstrated effective in vivo editing of plasmid DNA using both Cas9 and Cas9D10A nickase to convert green fluorescent protein (GFP)- to blue fluorescent protein (BFP)-expressing cells with 71% efficiency. Further, we successfully introduced a premature stop codon into the soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) hydroxylase component-encoding mmoX gene with the Cas9D10A nickase, disrupting sMMO function. These data provide proof of concept for CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in M. capsulatus Given the broad-host-range replicons and conjugation capability of these CRISPR/Cas9 tools, they have potential utility in other methanotrophs and a wide array of Gram-negative microorganisms.IMPORTANCE In this study, we targeted the development and evaluation of broad-host-range CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing tools in order to enhance the genetic-engineering capabilities of an industrially relevant methanotrophic biocatalyst. The CRISPR/Cas9 system developed in this study expands the genetic tools available to define molecular mechanisms in methanotrophic bacteria and has the potential to foster advances in the generation of novel biocatalysts to produce biofuels, platform chemicals, and high-value products from natural gas- and biogas-derived methane. Further, due to the broad-host-range applicability, these genetic tools may also enable innovative approaches to overcome the barriers associated with genetically engineering diverse, industrially promising nonmodel microorganisms.

30924555	Cell shape is critical for the proper function of every cell in every tissue in the body. This is especially true for the highly morphologically diverse neural and glia cells of the central nervous system. The molecular processes by which these, or indeed any, cells gain their particular cell-specific morphology remain largely unexplored. To identify the genes involved in the morphogenesis of the principal glial cell type in the vertebrate retina, the Müller glia (MG), we used genomic and CRISPR based strategies in zebrafish (Danio rerio). We identified 41 genes involved in various aspects of MG cell morphogenesis and revealed a striking concordance between the sequential steps of anatomical feature addition and the expression of cohorts of functionally related genes that regulate these steps. We noted that the many of the genes preferentially expressed in zebrafish MG showed conservation in glia across species suggesting evolutionarily conserved glial developmental pathways.

30922545	Tremendous advances have occurred in gene editing during the past 20 years with the development of a number of systems. The Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-associated protein 9 (Cas9) system represents an exciting area of research. This review examines both the relevant studies pertaining to the history, current status, and modifications of this system, in comparison with other gene-editing systems and future applications, and limitations of the CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing system, with a focus on applications of relevance to the surgeon scientist. The CRISPR-Cas9 system was described initially in 2012 for gene editing in bacteria and then in human cells, and since then, a number of modifications have improved the efficiency and specificity of gene editing. Clinical studies have been limited because further research is required to verify its safety in patients. Some clinical trials in oncology have opened, and early studies have shown that gene editing may have a particular role in the field of organ transplantation and in the care of trauma patients. Gene editing is likely to play an important role in future research in many aspects of the surgery arena.	SJ O'Brien|MB Ekman|S Manek|S Galandiuk
30918006	Gene drives could allow for control of vector-borne diseases by directly suppressing vector populations or spreading genetic payloads designed to reduce pathogen transmission. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) homing gene drives work by cleaving wild-type alleles, which are then converted to drive alleles by homology-directed repair, increasing the frequency of the drive in a population over time. However, resistance alleles can form when end-joining repair takes place in lieu of homology-directed repair. Such alleles cannot be converted to drive alleles, which would eventually halt the spread of a drive through a population. To investigate the effects of natural genetic variation on resistance formation, we developed a CRISPR homing gene drive in Drosophila melanogaster and crossed it into the genetically diverse Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) lines, measuring several performance parameters. Most strikingly, resistance allele formation postfertilization in the early embryo ranged from 7 to 79% among lines and averaged 42 ± 18%. We performed a genome-wide association study using our results in the DGRP lines, and found that the resistance and conversion rates were not explained by common alleles of large effect, but instead there were several genetic polymorphisms showing weak association. RNA interference knockdown of several genes containing these polymorphisms confirmed their effect, but the small effect sizes imply that their manipulation would likely yield only modest improvements to the efficacy of gene drives.

30912056	Adaptation of the CRISPR system has enabled scientists to probe the genome and interfere with gene function at an unprecedented scale. Adding to the use of CRISPR for generation of individual gene knockout, which is by now conventional, the CRISPR system enables high-throughput functional screening of the genome. By combining the integrative properties of lentiviral vector delivery with the disruptive nature of the CRISPR system, genome-wide CRISPR libraries provide the power to screen among thousands of genes despite the high complexity of the entire genome and identify a list of genes potentially affecting a certain phenotype. Genome-wide CRISPR screening is an advanced technology compiling numerous practical aspects and a series of molecular biology techniques. In this protocol, we describe all steps toward implementing CRISPR knockout screens in your research; we describe the core procedures and key information as well as some tricks and tips needed to successfully perform a CRISPR screen.

30912054	Genome editing and knockout by virus-based delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 may provide a new option to cure inherited and acquired ocular diseases. Here we describe development and application of lentivirus-based delivery vectors enabling knockout of the Vegfa gene. We show that Streptococcus pyogenes (Sp) Cas9 and single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) delivered by such vectors selectively can ablate the vascular endothelial growth factor A (Vegfa) gene in mouse retina following a single administration. These findings may contribute to the development of a new therapeutic path in the treatment of ocular diseases including exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD).

30912053	CRISPR, a revolutionizing technology allowing researchers to navigate in and edit the genome, is moving on the fast track toward clinical use for ex vivo correction of disease-causing mutations in stem cells. As we await the first trials utilizing ex vivo CRISPR editing, implementation of CRISPR-based gene editing as an in vivo treatment directly in patients still remains an ultimate challenge. However, quickly accumulating evidence has provided proof-of-concept for efficacious editing in vivo. Attempts to edit genes directly in animals have largely relied on classical vector systems based on virus-based delivery of gene cassettes encoding the Cas9 endonuclease and single guide RNA, the key components of the CRISPR system. However, whereas persistent gene expression has been the primary goal of gene therapy for decades, things may be different in the case of CRISPR delivery. Is short-term presence of the CRISPR components perhaps sufficient for efficacy and ideal for safety?-and are strategies needed for restricting immune recognition of the bacteria-derived editing tool? Here, while answers to these questions still blow in the wind, we review prominent examples of genome editing with focus on targeting of genes with CRISPR in liver, muscles, and eyes of the mouse.

30912043	Genome editing reagents including the recently introduced CRISPR/Cas9 system have become established and widely used molecular tools to answer fundamental biological questions and to target and treat genetic diseases. The CRISPR system, originally derived from bacteria and archaea, can be delivered into cells using different techniques, comprising (1) transfection of mRNA or plasmid DNA, (2) electroporation of plasmid DNA or the Cas9 protein in a complex with a g(uide)RNA, or (3) use of nonviral or viral vectors. Among the latter, Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are particularly attractive owing to many favorable traits: (1) their apathogenicity and episomal persistence, (2) the ease of virus production and purification, (3) the safe handling under lowest biosafety level 1 conditions, and (4) the availability of numerous natural serotypes and synthetic capsid variants with distinct cell specificities. Here, we describe a fast and simple protocol for small-scale packaging of CRISPR/Cas9 components into AAV vectors. To showcase its potential, we employ this method for screening of gRNAs targeting the murine miR-122 locus in Hepa1-6 cells (using AAV serotype 6, AAV6) or the 5'LTR of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in HeLaP4-NLtr cells (using a synthetic AAV9 variant). We furthermore provide a detailed protocol for large-scale production of purified AAV/CRISPR vector stocks that permit higher cleavage efficiencies in vitro and are suitable for direct in vivo applications.

30912040	Rapid evaluation of the CRISPR gRNA activity is an essential step of employing the technology in editing genes. Through machine learning strategy, the rule sets for in silico designing gRNAs with high activity has greatly improved. However, there are still discrepancies between different prediction rule sets, and between the predicted and actual gRNA activities. Thus, experimentally validating gRNA activity is still the gold standard in defining the best gRNAs for gene editing experiments. One such approach for experimentally selecting gRNAs with high activity is fluorescent surrogate reporter vectors. We had previously developed a dual-fluorescent surrogate system, called C-Check, which based on single-strand annealing repair of the DNA double-strand breaks introduced by CRISPR-Cas9 to generate a functional EGFP. The system offers a tool for rapid functional evaluation of CRISPR gRNA activity, as well as for enrichment of gene edited cells. In this chapter, we will give a step-by-step instruction on the design, generation, and application of the C-Check system for quantifying gRNA activities.	L Lin|Y Luo
30912038	Current genome editing tools enable targeted mutagenesis of selected DNA sequences in many species. However, the efficiency and the type of introduced mutations by the genome editing method are largely dependent on the target site. As a consequence, the outcome of the editing operation is difficult to predict. Therefore, a quick assay to quantify the frequency of mutations is vital for a proper assessment of genome editing actions. We developed two methods that are rapid, cost-effective, and readily applicable: (1) TIDE, which can accurately identify and quantify insertions and deletions (indels) that arise after introduction of double strand breaks (DSBs); (2) TIDER, which is suited for template-mediated editing events including point mutations. Both methods only require a set of PCR reactions and standard Sanger sequencing runs. The sequence traces are analyzed by the TIDE or TIDER algorithm (available at https://tide.nki.nl or https://deskgen.com). The routine is easy, fast, and provides much more detailed information than current enzyme-based assays. TIDE and TIDER accelerate testing and designing of DSB-based genome editing strategies.

30912037	The programmable clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated 9 (Cas9) and CRISPR-Cas9-derived gene editing and manipulation tools have revolutionized biomedical research over the past few years. One important category of assisting technologies in CRISPR gene editing is methods used for detecting and quantifying indels (deletions or insertions). These indels are caused by the repair of CRISPR-Cas9-introduced DNA double-stranded breaks (DBSs), known as CRISPR's DNA cleavage footprints. In addition, CRISPR-Cas9 can also leave footprints to the DNA without introducing DSBs, known as CRISPR's DNA-binding footprints. The indel tracking methods have contributed greatly to the improvement of CRISPR-Cas9 activity and specificity. Here, we review and discuss strategies developed over that past few years to track the CRISPR's footprints, their advantages, and limitations.	L Lin|Y Luo
30912036	Gene editing has great therapeutic impact, being of interest for many scientists worldwide. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) technology has been adapted for gene editing to serve as an efficient, rapid, and cost-effective tool. To fulfill CRISPR experiment's goals, two components are important: an endonuclease and a gRNA. The most commonly used endonucleases are Cpf1 and Cas9 and are described in depth in this chapter. The gRNA targets the genome site to be edited, giving great importance to its design to obtain increased efficiency and decreased off-target events. In this chapter, we describe different tools to design suitable gRNAs for a variety of experimental purposes.	M Pallarès Masmitjà|N Knödlseder|M Güell
30912024	The use of CRISPR/Cas9 to modify the mouse genome has gained immense interest in the past few years since it allows the direct modification of embryos, bypassing the need of labor-intensive procedures for the manipulation of embryonic stem cells. By shortening the overall timelines and reducing the costs for the generation of new genetically modified mouse lines (Li et al., Nat Biotechnol 31: 681-683, 2013), this technology has rapidly become a major tool for in vivo drug discovery applications.

30912013	The steadily increasing throughput in next-generation sequencing technologies is revolutionizing a number of fields in biology. One application requiring massive parallel sequencing is forward genetic screening based on chemical mutagenesis. Such screens interrogate the entire genome in an entirely unbiased fashion and can be applied to a number of research questions. CRISPR/Cas9-based screens, which are largely limited to a gene's loss of function, have already been very successful in identifying drug targets and pathways related to the drug's mode of action. By inducing single nucleotide changes using an alkylating reagent, it is possible to generate amino acid changes that perturb the interaction between a drug and its direct target, resulting in drug resistance. This chemogenomic approach combined with latest sequencing technologies allows deconvolution of drug targets and characterization of drug-target binding interfaces at amino acid resolution, therefore nicely complementing existing biochemical approaches. Here we describe a general protocol for a chemical mutagenesis-based forward genetic screen applicable for drug-target deconvolution.	M Horn|F Metge|MS Denzel
30909908	Corynebacterium glutamicum is an important industrial strain for the production of a diverse range of chemicals. Cpf1 nucleases are highly specific and programmable, with efficiencies comparable to those of Cas9. Although the Francisella novicida (Fn) CRISPR-Cpf1 system has been adapted for genome editing in C. glutamicum, the editing efficiency is currently less than 15%, due to false positives caused by the poor targeting efficiency of the crRNA.	To address this limitation, a screening strategy was developed in this study to systematically evaluate crRNA targeting efficiency in C. glutamicum. We quantitatively examined various parameters of the C. glutamicum CRISPR-Cpf1 system, including the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence, the length of the spacer sequence, and the type of repair template. We found that the most efficient C. glutamicum crRNA contained a 5'-NYTV-3' PAM and a 21 bp spacer sequence. Moreover, we observed that linear DNA could be used to repair double strand breaks.	Here, we identified optimized PAM-related parameters for the CRISPR-Cpf1 system in C. glutamicum. Our study sheds light on the function of the FnCpf1 endonuclease and Cpf1-based genome editing. This optimized system, with higher editing efficiency, could be used to increase the production of bulk chemicals, such as isobutyrate, in C. glutamicum.	J Zhang|F Yang|Y Yang|Y Jiang|YX Huo
30905885	Many powerful molecular biology tools have their origin in nature. From restriction enzymes to CRISPR-Cas9, microbes utilize a diverse array of systems to get ahead evolutionarily. We are exploring this natural diversity through bioinformatics, biochemical, and molecular work to better understand the fundamental ways in which microbes and other living organisms sense and respond to their environment and as possible to develop these natural systems as molecular tools and to improve human health. Building on our demonstration that Cas9 can be repurposed for precision genome editing in mammalian cells, we look for novel CRISPR-Cas systems that are different and may have other useful properties. This led to the discovery of several new CRISPR systems, including the CRISPR-Cas13 family that target RNA, rather than DNA. We have developed a toolbox for RNA modulation based on Cas13, including methods for precision base editing, adding to our robust toolbox for DNA based on Cas9 and Cas12. We are expanding our biodiscovery efforts to search for new microbial proteins that may be adapted for applications beyond genome and transcriptome modulation, capitalizing on the growing volume of microbial genomic sequences. We are particularly interested in identifying new therapeutic modalities and vehicles for delivering them into patients. We hope that additional robust tools and delivery options will further accelerate research into human disease and open up new therapeutic possibilities.	F Zhang
30905739	Primed epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) can be reverted to a pluripotent embryonic stem cell (ESC)-like state by expression of single reprogramming factor. We used CRISPR activation to perform a genome-scale, reprogramming screen in EpiSCs and identified 142 candidate genes. Our screen validated a total of 50 genes, previously not known to contribute to reprogramming, of which we chose Sall1 for further investigation. We show that Sall1 augments reprogramming of mouse EpiSCs and embryonic fibroblasts and that these induced pluripotent stem cells are indeed fully pluripotent including formation of chimeric mice. We also demonstrate that Sall1 synergizes with Nanog in reprogramming and that overexpression in ESCs delays their conversion back to EpiSCs. Lastly, using RNA sequencing, we identify and validate Klf5 and Fam189a2 as new downstream targets of Sall1 and Nanog. In summary, our work demonstrates the power of using CRISPR technology in understanding molecular mechanisms that mediate complex cellular processes such as reprogramming.

30905296	Mice Against Ticks is a community-guided ecological engineering project that aims to prevent tick-borne disease by using CRISPR-based genome editing to heritably immunize the white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) responsible for infecting many ticks in eastern North America. Introducing antibody-encoding resistance alleles into the local mouse population is anticipated to disrupt the disease transmission cycle for decades. Technology development is shaped by engagement with community members and visitors to the islands of Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard, including decisions at project inception about which types of disease resistance to pursue. This engagement process has prompted the researchers to use only white-footed mouse DNA if possible, meaning the current project will not involve gene drive. Instead, engineered mice would be released in the spring when the natural population is low, a plan unlikely to increase total numbers above the normal maximum in autumn. Community members are continually asked to share their suggestions and concerns, a process that has already identified potential ecological consequences unanticipated by the research team that will likely affect implementation. As an early example of CRISPR-based ecological engineering, Mice Against Ticks aims to start small and simple by working with island communities whose mouse populations can be lastingly immunized without gene drive.

30905295	Our bodies are colonized by a complex ecosystem of bacteria, unicellular eukaryotes and their viruses that together play a major role in our health. Over the past few years tools derived from the prokaryotic immune system known as CRISPR-Cas have empowered researchers to modify and study organisms with unprecedented ease and efficiency. Here we discuss how various types of CRISPR-Cas systems can be used to modify the genome of gut microorganisms and bacteriophages. CRISPR-Cas systems can also be delivered to bacterial population and programmed to specifically eliminate members of the microbiome. Finally, engineered CRISPR-Cas systems can be used to control gene expression and modulate the production of metabolites and proteins. Together these tools provide exciting opportunities to investigate the complex interplay between members of the microbiome and our bodies, and present new avenues for the development of drugs that target the microbiome.

30905291	We investigated the diversity of CRISPR spacers of Thermus communities from two locations in Italy, two in Chile and one location in Russia. Among the five sampling sites, a total of more than 7200 unique spacers belonging to different CRISPR-Cas systems types and subtypes were identified. Most of these spacers are not found in CRISPR arrays of sequenced Thermus strains. Comparison of spacer sets revealed that samples within the same area (separated by few to hundreds of metres) have similar spacer sets, which appear to be largely stable at least over the course of several years. While at further distances (hundreds of kilometres and more) the similarity of spacer sets is decreased, there are still multiple common spacers in Thermus communities from different continents. The common spacers can be reconstructed in identical or similar CRISPR arrays, excluding their independent appearance and suggesting an extensive migration of thermophilic bacteria over long distances. Several new Thermus phages were isolated in the sampling sites. Mapping of spacers to bacteriophage sequences revealed examples of local acquisition of spacers from some phages and distinct patterns of targeting of phage genomes by different CRISPR-Cas systems.

30905289	So far, studies on the bacterial immune system CRISPR-Cas and its ecological and evolutionary effects have been largely limited to laboratory conditions. While providing crucial information on the constituents of CRISPR-Cas, such studies may overlook fundamental components that affect bacterial immunity in natural habitats. Translating laboratory-derived predictions to nature is not a trivial task, owing partly to the instability of natural communities and difficulties in repeated sampling. To this end, we review how aquaculture, the farming of fishes and other aquatic species, may provide suitable semi-natural laboratories for examining the role of CRISPR-Cas in phage/bacterium coevolution. Existing data from disease surveillance conducted in aquaculture, coupled with growing interest towards phage therapy, may have already resulted in large collections of bacterium and phage isolates. These data, combined with premeditated efforts, can provide empirical evidence on phage-bacterium dynamics such as the bacteriophage adherence to mucus hypothesis, phage life cycles and their relationship with CRISPR-Cas and other immune defences. Typing of CRISPR spacer content in pathogenic bacteria can also provide practical information on diversity and origin of isolates during outbreaks. In addition to providing information of CRISPR functionality and phage-bacterium dynamics, aquaculture systems can significantly impact perspectives on design of phage-based disease treatment at the current era of increasing antibiotic resistance.

30905281	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas-mediated immunity in bacteria allows bacterial populations to protect themselves against pathogens. However, it also exposes them to the dangers of auto-immunity by developing protection that targets its own genome. Using a simple model of the coupled dynamics of phage and bacterial populations, we explore how acquisition rates affect the probability of the bacterial colony going extinct. We find that the optimal strategy depends on the initial population sizes of both viruses and bacteria. Additionally, certain combinations of acquisition and dynamical rates and initial population sizes guarantee protection, owing to a dynamical balance between the evolving population sizes, without relying on acquisition of viral spacers. Outside this regime, the high cost of auto-immunity limits the acquisition rate. We discuss these optimal strategies that minimize the probability of the colony going extinct in terms of recent experiments. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'The ecology and evolution of prokaryotic CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune systems'.	S Bradde|T Mora|AM Walczak
30902858	Bacteria in the genus Staphylococcus are important targets for phage therapy due to their prevalence as pathogens and increasing antibiotic resistance. Here we review Staphylococcus outer surface features and specific phage resistance mechanisms that define the host range, the set of strains that an individual phage can potentially infect. Phage infection goes through five distinct phases: attachment, uptake, biosynthesis, assembly, and lysis. Adsorption inhibition, encompassing outer surface teichoic acid receptor alteration, elimination, or occlusion, limits successful phage attachment and entry. Restriction-modification systems (in particular, type I and IV systems), which target phage DNA inside the cell, serve as the major barriers to biosynthesis as well as transduction and horizontal gene transfer between clonal complexes and species. Resistance to late stages of infection occurs through mechanisms such as assembly interference, in which staphylococcal pathogenicity islands siphon away superinfecting phage proteins to package their own DNA. While genes responsible for teichoic acid biosynthesis, capsule, and restriction-modification are found in most Staphylococcus strains, a variety of other host range determinants (e.g., clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, abortive infection, and superinfection immunity) are sporadic. The fitness costs of phage resistance through teichoic acid structure alteration could make staphylococcal phage therapies promising, but host range prediction is complex because of the large number of genes involved, and the roles of many of these are unknown. In addition, little is known about the genetic determinants that contribute to host range expansion in the phages themselves. Future research must identify host range determinants, characterize resistance development during infection and treatment, and examine population-wide genetic background effects on resistance selection.

30900787	During the evolution of plant genomes, sequence inversions occurred repeatedly making the respective regions inaccessible for meiotic recombination and thus for breeding. Therefore, it is important to develop technologies that allow the induction of inversions within chromosomes in a directed and efficient manner. Using the Cas9 nuclease from Staphylococcus aureus (SaCas9), we were able to obtain scarless heritable inversions with high efficiency in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Via deep sequencing, we defined the patterns of junction formation in wild-type and in the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) mutant ku70-1. Surprisingly, in plants deficient of KU70, inversion induction is enhanced, indicating that KU70 is required for tethering the local broken ends together during repair. However, in contrast to wild-type, most junctions are formed by microhomology-mediated NHEJ and thus are imperfect with mainly deletions, making this approach unsuitable for practical applications. Using egg-cell-specific expression of Cas9, we were able to induce heritable inversions at different genomic loci and at intervals between 3 and 18 kb, in the percentage range, in the T1 generation. By screening individual lines, inversion frequencies of up to the 10% range were found in T2. Most of these inversions had scarless junctions and were without any sequence change within the inverted region, making the technology attractive for use in crop plants. Applying our approach, it should be possible to reverse natural inversions and induce artificial ones to break or fix linkages between traits at will.	C Schmidt|M Pacher|H Puchta
30898113	Despite its relatively low incidence, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a leading cause of cancer deaths because of the aggressive growth/metastasis of the tumor, the lack of early symptoms, and the poor treatment options. Basic research to identify potential therapeutic targets for PDAC is greatly needed.	We used a negative-selection genome-wide CRISPR screen to identify essential genes in the PANC-1 human pancreatic carcinoma cell line. We validated the top hits with follow-up siRNA screens, using the HPNE, HPAF-II, AsPC-1, and Mia PaCa-2 cell lines.	The PSMA6 gene was an identified candidate hit after the CRISPR screen, siRNA validation screen, and siRNA deconvolution screen. Spheroid formation assays and flow cytometry analysis showed that PSMA6 is critical for survival in many pancreatic ductal carcinoma cell models. Lastly, as PSMA6 protein is a proteosomal subunit of the 20S core complex, we showed that bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor, was especially toxic in PANC-1 cells.	Further study of PSMA6 and the proteasome subunit that it encodes, along with other hits identified in our CRISPR screens, may provide valuable insights into potential therapeutic targets for PDAC.

30897705	Cardiac β₂-adrenergic receptors (ARs) are known to inhibit collagen production and fibrosis in cardiac fibroblasts and myocytes. The β₂AR is a Gs protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) and, upon its activation, stimulates the generation of cyclic 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). cAMP has two effectors: protein kinase A (PKA) and the exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (Epac). Epac1 has been shown to inhibit cardiac fibroblast activation and fibrosis. Osteopontin (OPN) is a ubiquitous pro-inflammatory cytokine, which also mediates fibrosis in several tissues, including the heart. OPN underlies several cardiovascular pathologies, including atherosclerosis and cardiac adverse remodeling. We found that the cardiotoxic hormone aldosterone transcriptionally upregulates OPN in H9c2 rat cardiac myoblasts-an effect prevented by endogenous β₂AR activation. Additionally, CRISPR-mediated OPN deletion enhanced cAMP generation in response to both β₁AR and β₂AR activation in H9c2 cardiomyocytes, leading to the upregulation of Epac1 protein levels. These effects rendered β₂AR stimulation capable of completely abrogating transforming growth factor (TGF)-β-dependent fibrosis in OPN-lacking H9c2 cardiomyocytes. Finally, OPN interacted constitutively with Gαs subunits in H9c2 cardiac cells. Thus, we uncovered a direct inhibitory role of OPN in cardiac β₂AR anti-fibrotic signaling via cAMP/Epac1. OPN blockade could be of value in the treatment and/or prevention of cardiac fibrosis.	CM Pollard|VL Desimine|SL Wertz|A Perez|BM Parker|J Maning|KA McCrink|LA Shehadeh|A Lymperopoulos
30897091	Highly social insects are characterized by caste dimorphism, with distinct size differences of reproductive organs between fertile queens and the more or less sterile workers. An abundance of nutrition or instruction via diet-specific compounds has been proposed as explanations for the nutrition-driven queen and worker polyphenism. Here, we further explored these models in the honeybee (Apis mellifera) using worker nutrition rearing and a novel mutational screening approach using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) method. The worker nutrition-driven size reduction of reproductive organs was restricted to the female sex, suggesting input from the sex determination pathway. Genetic screens on the sex determination genes in genetic females for size polyphenism revealed that doublesex (dsx) mutants display size-reduced reproductive organs irrespective of the sexual morphology of the organ tissue. In contrast, feminizer (fem) mutants lost the response to worker nutrition-driven size control. The first morphological worker mutants in honeybees demonstrate that the response to nutrition relies on a genetic program that is switched "ON" by the fem gene. Thus, the genetic instruction provided by the fem gene provides an entry point to genetically dissect the underlying processes that implement the size polyphenism.

30894803	Little is known about the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in the formation of the cranial peripheral sensory system in vertebrates. To identify genes involved in the formation of these circuits, we performed a forward genetic screen utilizing a transgenic zebrafish line (p2rx3.2:gfpsl1) that expresses green fluorescent protein (gfp) in sensory neurons of the Vth, VIIth, IXth and Xth cranial ganglia. Here, we describe a novel zebrafish mutant in which a missense mutation in the adam19b gene selectively affects the epibranchial sensory circuits.	JA Cox|MM Voigt
30894153	The CRISPR/Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat and CRISPR-associated nucleases) based technologies have revolutionized genome engineering. While their use for prokaryotic genome editing is expanding, some limitations remain such as possible off-target effects and design constraints. These are compounded when performing systematic genome editing at distinct loci or when targeting repeated sequences (e.g. multicopy genes or mobile genetic elements). To overcome these limitations, we designed an approach using the same sgRNA and CRISPR-Cas9 system to independently perform gene editing at different loci.	We developed a two-step procedure based on the introduction by homologous recombination of 'bait' DNA at the vicinity of a gene copy of interest before inducing CRISPR-Cas9 activity. The introduction of a genetic tool encoding a CRISPR-Cas9 complex targeting this 'bait' DNA induces a double strand break near the copy of interest. Its repair by homologous recombination can lead either to reversion or gene copy-specific editing. The relative frequencies of these events are linked to the impact of gene editing on cell fitness. In our study, we used this technology to successfully delete the native copies of two xenogeneic silencers lsr2 paralogs in Streptomyces ambofaciens. We observed that one of these paralogs is a candidate-essential gene since its native locus can be deleted only in the presence of an extra copy.	By targeting 'bait' DNA, we designed a 'generic' CRISPR-Cas9 toolkit that can be used to edit different loci. The differential action of this CRISPR-Cas9 system is exclusively based on the specific recombination between regions surrounding the gene copy of interest. This approach is suitable to edit multicopy genes. One such particular example corresponds to the mutagenesis of candidate-essential genes that requires the presence of an extra copy of the gene before gene disruption. This opens new insights to explore gene essentiality in bacteria and to limit off-target effects during systematic CRISPR-Cas9 based approaches.	S Najah|C Saulnier|JL Pernodet|S Bury-Moné

30886355	CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) loci and their associated (cas) genes encode an adaptive immune system that protects prokaryotes from viral1 and plasmid2 invaders. Following viral (phage) infection, a small fraction of the prokaryotic cells are able to integrate a small sequence of the invader's genome into the CRISPR array1. These sequences, known as spacers, are transcribed and processed into small CRISPR RNA guides3-5 that associate with Cas nucleases to specify a viral target for destruction6-9. Although CRISPR-cas loci are widely distributed throughout microbial genomes and often display hallmarks of horizontal gene transfer10-12, the drivers of CRISPR dissemination remain unclear. Here, we show that spacers can recombine with phage target sequences to mediate a form of specialized transduction of CRISPR elements. Phage targets in phage 85, ΦNM1, ΦNM4 and Φ12 can recombine with spacers in either chromosomal or plasmid-borne CRISPR loci in Staphylococcus, leading to either the transfer of CRISPR-adjacent genes or the propagation of acquired immunity to other bacteria in the population, respectively. Our data demonstrate that spacer sequences not only specify the targets of Cas nucleases but also can promote horizontal gene transfer.	A Varble|S Meaden|R Barrangou|ER Westra|LA Marraffini
30885348	Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is the key event in distant metastasis of diverse tumors including lung cancer. Recent evidence suggests the involvement of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) in EMT phenotypes. However, the molecular mechanism of EMT induced by PTEN inactivation is not clear in lung cancer. We aimed to investigate the role of PTEN inactivation in acquisition of EMT in lung cancer cells.	We knocked out the PTEN in PTEN proficient lung cancer cells lines (A549 and NCI-H460) using CRISPR/Cas-9 system and observed the growth, EMT phenotypes, and EMT related molecules. We also explored the in vivo effect of PTEN inactivation on tumor cell growth and distant metastasis using nude mouse injection.	PTEN knockout (KO) cells showed faster growth, migration and invasion than PTEN wild-type (WT) cells. When we injected the cells into nude mice, PTEN-KO cells showed faster growth and higher metastatic potential. In PTEN-KO cells, the levels of phosphorylated AKT (Ser-473 and Thr-308) were profoundly elevated and the expressions of phosphorylated GSK-3β (Ser9, inactive form) increased, while that of β-catenin decreased. Regarding the EMT markers, the expression of E-cadherin decreased but those of N-cadherin, vimentin and MMP-2 increased in the PTEN-KO cells. Especially, PTEN-KO cells showed the almost complete intra-nuclear shift of β-catenin and no β-catenin signal was observed in the cell membrane. Accordingly, PTEN-KO cells exhibited morphological changes such as loss of cell-to-cell contact, pseudopodia and the round shape, which are the typical phenotypes of EMT. Snail and Slug were also dominantly accumulated in the nucleus after PTEN inactivation.	All these data consistently support that PTEN inactivation contributes to EMT by nuclear translocation of β-catenin and Snail/Slug in lung cancer cells.

30883991	Respiratory diseases, such as influenza infection, acute tracheal bronchitis, pneumonia, tuberculosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, lung cancer and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, continue to significantly impact human health. Diseases of the lung and respiratory tract are influenced by environmental conditions and socio-economic factors; however, many of these serious respiratory disorders are also rooted in genetic or epigenetic causes. Clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins, isolated from the immune system of prokaryotes, provide a tool to manipulate gene sequences and gene expression with significant implications for respiratory research. CRISPR/Cas systems allow preclinical modelling of causal factors involved in many respiratory diseases, providing new insights into their underlying mechanisms. CRISPR can also be used to screen for genes involved in respiratory processes, development and pathology, identifying novel disease drivers or drug targets. Finally, CRISPR/Cas systems can potentially correct genetic mutations and edit epigenetic marks that contribute to respiratory disorders, providing a form of personalized medicine that could be used in conjunction with other technologies such as stem cell reprogramming and transplantation. CRISPR gene editing is a young field of research, and concerns regarding its specificity, as well as the need for efficient and safe delivery methods, need to be addressed further. However, CRISPR/Cas systems represent a significant step forward for research and therapy in respiratory health, and it is likely we will see the breakthroughs generated from this technology continue.

30883196	Programmable nucleases and deaminases, which include zinc-finger nucleases, transcription activator-like effector nucleases, CRISPR RNA-guided nucleases, and RNA-guided base editors, are now widely employed for the targeted modification of genomes in cells and organisms. These gene-editing tools hold tremendous promise for therapeutic applications. Importantly, these nucleases and deaminases may display off-target activity through the recognition of near-cognate DNA sequences to their target sites, resulting in collateral damage to the genome in the form of local mutagenesis or genomic rearrangements. For therapeutic genome-editing applications with these classes of programmable enzymes, it is essential to measure and limit genome-wide off-target activity. Herein, we discuss the key determinants of off-target activity for these systems. We describe various cell-based and cell-free methods for identifying genome-wide off-target sites and diverse strategies that have been developed for reducing the off-target activity of programmable gene-editing enzymes.

30882798	Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) biology is a new and exciting field of research, with the number of publications from this field growing exponentially since 2007. These studies have confirmed that lncRNAs are altered in almost all diseases. However, studying the functional roles for lncRNAs in the context of disease remains difficult due to the lack of protein products, tissue-specific expression, low expression levels, complexities in splice forms, and lack of conservation among species. Given the species-specific expression, lncRNA studies are often restricted to human research contexts when studying disease processes. Since lncRNAs function at the molecular level, one way to dissect lncRNA biology is to either remove the lncRNA or overexpress the lncRNA and measure cellular effects. In this article, a written and visualized protocol to overexpress lncRNAs in vitro is presented. As a representative experiment, an lncRNA associated with inflammatory bowel disease, Interferon Gamma Antisense 1 (IFNG-AS1), is shown to be overexpressed in a Jurkat T-cell model. To accomplish this, the activating clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) technique is used to enable overexpression at the endogenous genomic loci. The activating CRISPR technique targets a set of transcription factors to the transcriptional start site of a gene, enabling a robust overexpression of multiple lncRNA splice forms. This procedure will be broken down into three steps, namely (i) guide RNA (gRNA) design and vector construction, (ii) virus generation and transduction, and (iii) colony screening for overexpression. For this representative experiment, a greater than 20-fold enhancement in IFNG-AS1 in Jurkat T cells was observed.

30880567	Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) hold a great promise for successful development of regenerative medicine. Among the plenty of uncovered MSCs sources, desquamated endometrium collected from the menstrual blood probably remains the most accessible. Though numerous studies have been published on human endometrium-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMESCs) properties in the past years, there are only a few data regarding their genetic modulation. Moreover, there is a lack of information about the fate of the transduced hMESCs. The present study aimed to optimize hMESCs transduction parameters and apply Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 technology for genome and secretome modification. The fate of hMESCs transduced either in presence of polybrene (Pb) or protamine sulfate (Ps) was assessed by alterations in CD expression profile, growth rate, cell size, migration capability, osteogenic, adipogenic, and decidual differential potentials. Here, we postulated that the use of Ps for hMESCs genetic manipulations is preferable, as it has no impact on the stem-cell properties, whereas Pb application is undesirable, as it induces cellular senescence. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 was selected for further targeted hMESCs genome and secretome modification using CRISPR/Cas9 systems. The obtained data provide optimized transduction scheme for hMESCs and verification of its effectiveness by successful hMESCs genome editing via CRISPR/Cas9 technology.

30875561	Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy provides possibility for the treatment of malignancies since clinical trials have shown that CAR-T therapy has a significant anti-tumor effect. Although many efforts have been made to improve the efficacy and reduce the side effects of CAR-T therapy, there are still many problems to solve. With the rapid development of this field, combination immunotherapy has been proved to improve the efficacy of CAR-T therapy. Studies have shown that radiotherapy, chemotherapy, oncolytic virotherapy, BTK inhibitors and immune checkpoint blockade-based therapy may further enhance the efficacy of CAR-T therapy while CRISPR/Cas9 technology and IL-1 blockade may improve the safety. In this review, we summarized the advantages and the mechanisms of the combination immunotherapy based on CAR-T cell therapy.	L Wang|R Yao|L Zhang|C Fan|L Ma|J Liu
30874768	The solventogenic clostridia have long been known for their ability to convert sugars from complex feedstocks into commercially important solvents. Although the acetone-butanol-ethanol process fell out of favour decades ago, renewed interest in sustainability and 'green' chemistry has re-established our appetite for reviving technologies such as these, albeit with 21st century improvements. As CRISPR-Cas genome editing tools are being developed and applied to the solventogenic clostridia, their industrial potential is growing. Through integration of new pathways, the beneficial traits and historical track record of clostridial fermentation can be exploited to generate a much wider range of industrially relevant products. Here we show the application of genome editing using the endogenous CRISPR-Cas mechanism of Clostridium saccharoperbutylacetonicum N1-4(HMT), to generate a deletion, SNP and to integrate new DNA into the genome. These technological advancements pave the way for application of clostridial species to the production of an array of products.	AN Atmadjaja|V Holby|AJ Harding|P Krabben|HK Smith|ER Jenkinson
30873542	Prostate transmembrane protein androgen-induced 1 (PMEPA1)/transmembrane prostate androgen-induced protein (TMEPAI), a direct target and a negative regulator of transforming growth factor beta signalling, has an oncogenic role in many cancers. We observed that knockout (KO) of PMEPA1 in human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 using a CRISPR-Cas9 system resulted in reduction of in vivo tumour growth and lung metastasis but not of in vitro monolayer growth capacity of these KO cell lines. This phenomenon was associated with PMEPA1 KO-mediated downregulation of the key proangiogenic factors vascular endothelial growth factor alpha (VEGFA) and interleukin-8 (IL8) that are essential for in vivo but not in vitro growing cells and are also substantial for initiation of lung metastasis.

30872121	Bacteria and archaea have evolved sophisticated adaptive immune systems that rely on CRISPR RNA (crRNA)-guided detection and nuclease-mediated elimination of invading nucleic acids. Here, we present the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the type I-F crRNA-guided surveillance complex (Csy complex) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa bound to a double-stranded DNA target. Comparison of this structure to previously determined structures of this complex reveals a ∼180-degree rotation of the C-terminal helical bundle on the "large" Cas8f subunit. We show that the double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)-induced conformational change in Cas8f exposes a Cas2/3 "nuclease recruitment helix" that is structurally homologous to a virally encoded anti-CRISPR protein (AcrIF3). Structural homology between Cas8f and AcrIF3 suggests that AcrIF3 is a mimic of the Cas8f nuclease recruitment helix.

30871076	The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) technology is a versatile and useful tool to perform genome editing in different organisms ranging from bacteria and yeast to plants and mammalian cells. For a couple of years, it was believed that the system was inefficient and toxic in the alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. However, recently the system has been successfully implemented in this model organism, albeit relying mostly on the electroporation of ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) into cell wall deficient strains. This requires a constant source of RNPs and limits the application of the technology to strains that are not necessarily the most relevant from a biotechnological point of view. Here, we show that transient expression of the Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 gene and sgRNAs, targeted to the single-copy nuclear apt9 gene, encoding an adenine phosphoribosyl transferase (APT), results in efficient disruption at the expected locus. Introduction of indels to the apt9 locus results in cell insensitivity to the otherwise toxic compound 2-fluoroadenine (2-FA). We have used agitation with glass beads and particle bombardment to introduce the plasmids carrying the coding sequences for Cas9 and the sgRNAs in a cell-walled strain of C. reinhardtii (CC-125). Using sgRNAs targeting exons 1 and 3 of apt9, we obtained disruption efficiencies of 3 and 30% on preselected 2-FA resistant colonies, respectively. Our results show that transient expression of Cas9 and a sgRNA can be used for editing of the nuclear genome inexpensively and at high efficiency. Targeting of the APT gene could potentially be used as a pre-selection marker for multiplexed editing or disruption of genes of interest.

30853401	Selective autophagy recycles damaged organelles and clears intracellular pathogens to prevent their aberrant accumulation. How ULK1 kinase is targeted and activated during selective autophagic events remains to be elucidated. In this study, we used chemically inducible dimerization (CID) assays in tandem with CRISPR KO lines to systematically analyze the molecular basis of selective autophagosome biogenesis. We demonstrate that ectopic placement of NDP52 on mitochondria or peroxisomes is sufficient to initiate selective autophagy by focally localizing and activating the ULK1 complex. The capability of NDP52 to induce mitophagy is dependent on its interaction with the FIP200/ULK1 complex, which is facilitated by TBK1. Ectopically tethering ULK1 to cargo bypasses the requirement for autophagy receptors and TBK1. Focal activation of ULK1 occurs independently of AMPK and mTOR. Our findings provide a parsimonious model of selective autophagy, which highlights the coordination of ULK1 complex localization by autophagy receptors and TBK1 as principal drivers of targeted autophagosome biogenesis.

30850590	CRISPR-Cas9 is a promising technology for genome editing. Here we use Cas9 nuclease-induced double-strand break DNA (DSB) at the UROS locus to model and correct congenital erythropoietic porphyria. We demonstrate that homology-directed repair is rare compared with NHEJ pathway leading to on-target indels and causing unwanted dysfunctional protein. Moreover, we describe unexpected chromosomal truncations resulting from only one Cas9 nuclease-induced DSB in cell lines and primary cells by a p53-dependent mechanism. Altogether, these side effects may limit the promising perspectives of the CRISPR-Cas9 nuclease system for disease modeling and gene therapy. We show that the single nickase approach could be safer since it prevents on- and off-target indels and chromosomal truncations. These results demonstrate that the single nickase and not the nuclease approach is preferable, not only for modeling disease but also and more importantly for the safe management of future CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene therapies.

30850374	We present ampliCan, an analysis tool for genome editing that unites highly precise quantification and visualization of genuine genome editing events. ampliCan features nuclease-optimized alignments, filtering of experimental artifacts, event-specific normalization, and off-target read detection and quantifies insertions, deletions, HDR repair, as well as targeted base editing. It is scalable to thousands of amplicon sequencing-based experiments from any genome editing experiment, including CRISPR. It enables automated integration of controls and accounts for biases at every step of the analysis. We benchmarked ampliCan on both real and simulated data sets against other leading tools, demonstrating that it outperformed all in the face of common confounding factors.

30845180	The mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) is a mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) binding protein essential for the initiation of transcription and genome maintenance. Recently it was demonstrated that the primary role of TFAM is to maintain the integrity of mtDNA and that it is a key regulator of mtDNA copy number. It was also shown that TFAM plays a central role in the mtDNA stress-mediated inflammatory response. In our study, we proposed to evaluate the possibility of editing the TFAM gene by CRISPR/Cas9 technology in bovine fibroblasts, as TFAM regulates the replication specificity of mtDNA. We further attempted to maintain these cells in culture post edition in a medium supplemented with uridine and pyruvate to mimic Rho zero cells that are capable of surviving without mtDNA, because it is known that the TFAM gene is lethal in knockout mice and chicken. Moreover, we evaluated the effects of TFAM modification on mtDNA copy number. The CRISPR gRNA was designed to target exon 1 of the bovine TFAM gene and subsequently cloned. Fibroblasts were transfected with Cas9 and control plasmids. After 24 h of transfection, cells were analyzed by flow cytometry to evaluate the efficiency of transfection. The site directed-mutation frequency was assessed by T7 endonuclease assay, and cell clones were analyzed for mtDNA copy number by Sanger DNA sequencing. We achieved transfection efficiency of 51.3%. We selected 23 successfully transformed clones for further analysis, and seven of these exhibited directed mutations at the CRISPR/Cas9 targeted site. Moreover, we also found a decrease in mtDNA copy number in the gene edited clones compared to that in the controls. These TFAM gene mutant cells were viable in culture when supplemented with uridine and pyruvate. We conclude that this CRISPR/Cas9 design was efficient, resulting in seven heterozygous mutant clones and opening up the possibility to use these mutant cell lines as a model system to elucidate the role of TFAM in the maintenance of mtDNA integrity.

30841971	It is urgent to find an avian influenza A H7N9 detection simple method which is suitable for on-site detection. The Cas13a protein just likes a nanomachine, when specifically bound to target RNA by single-stranded RNA (crRNA), changes its protein structure and produces RNase activity, which degrades RNA non-specifically. Harnessing Cas13a, the paper aims to establish an underlying on-site H7N9 virus nucleic acid detection method. LwCas13a protein nanomachine was expressed in a prokaryotic expression system and purified by nickel column. In vitro transcribed RNA of H7N9 HA gene has been used as a target, to design a specific crRNA. The activity of Cas13a was verified with a single-stranded RNA-bound fluorescent group and a quenching fluorophore as signals. Using Cas13a, a room temperature H7N9 detection system was established. Detection of 1 nm of single-stranded RNA can be done within 5 min. When combined with the RT-RPA and T7 transcription system at room temperature, the detection limits of HA and NA are 1 fM and the reaction time is 50 min. Excellent specificity was achieved by comparison with subtype viruses such as H1N1 and H5N1. The rapid detection method based on CRISPR-Cas13a nanomachine H7N9 has been successfully established, which can detect H7N9 quickly and specifically. In the future, it can be quickly detected in the field with portable fluorescence detector.	Y Liu|H Xu|C Liu|L Peng|H Khan|L Cui|R Huang|C Wu|S Shen|S Wang|W Liang|Z Li|B Xu|N He
30841961	The target lengths of gene-editing enzymes vary from approximately 20 to 80 nucleotides. The ideal reporter genes should be able to tolerate the insertion of target sequences to differentiate the phenotypic changes between in-frame and frame shift mutations for evaluating the enzymatic activities and off-target effects of gene-editing enzymes such as zinc finger nucleases, transcription activator-like effector nucleases, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-associated system. This study demonstrated that the zeocin resistance gene (ZeoR) tolerated the insertion of long targets for a variety of tests using a strategy of inserting tandem repeats of NNT. Four genes such as CCR5, AR, HPV 16E7 early gene, and EGFR applications of ZeoR in quantitatively analyzing the off-targets of CRISPR were successful. The data indicated that evaluating the enzymatic activities and off-target effects with assays employing ZeoR had great potential in facilitating the application of gene editing to human gene therapy.

30838976	Current technologies used to generate CRISPR/Cas gene perturbation reagents are labor intense and require multiple ligation and cloning steps. Furthermore, increasing gRNA sequence diversity negatively affects gRNA distribution, leading to libraries of heterogeneous quality. Here, we present a rapid and cloning-free mutagenesis technology that can efficiently generate covalently-closed-circular-synthesized (3Cs) CRISPR/Cas gRNA reagents and that uncouples sequence diversity from sequence distribution. We demonstrate the fidelity and performance of 3Cs reagents by tailored targeting of all human deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) and identify their essentiality for cell fitness. To explore high-content screening, we aimed to generate the largest up-to-date gRNA library that can be used to interrogate the coding and noncoding human genome and simultaneously to identify genes, predicted promoter flanking regions, transcription factors and CTCF binding sites that are linked to doxorubicin resistance. Our 3Cs technology enables fast and robust generation of bias-free gene perturbation libraries with yet unmatched diversities and should be considered an alternative to established technologies.

30837341	Viral infection exerts selection pressure on marine microbes, as virus-induced cell lysis causes 20 to 50% of cell mortality, resulting in fluxes of biomass into oceanic dissolved organic matter. Archaeal and bacterial populations can defend against viral infection using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-associated (Cas) system, which relies on specific matching between a spacer sequence and a viral gene. If a CRISPR spacer match to any gene within a viral genome is equally effective in preventing lysis, no viral genes should be preferentially matched by CRISPR spacers. However, if there are differences in effectiveness, certain viral genes may demonstrate a greater frequency of CRISPR spacer matches. Indeed, homology search analyses of bacterioplankton CRISPR spacer sequences against virioplankton sequences revealed preferential matching of replication proteins, nucleic acid binding proteins, and viral structural proteins. Positive selection pressure for effective viral defense is one parsimonious explanation for these observations. CRISPR spacers from virioplankton metagenomes preferentially matched methyltransferase and phage integrase genes within virioplankton sequences. These virioplankton CRISPR spacers may assist infected host cells in defending against competing phage. Analyses also revealed that half of the spacer-matched viral genes were unknown, some genes matched several spacers, and some spacers matched multiple genes, a many-to-many relationship. Thus, CRISPR spacer matching may be an evolutionary algorithm, agnostically identifying those genes under stringent selection pressure for sustaining viral infection and lysis. Investigating this subset of viral genes could reveal those genetic mechanisms essential to virus-host interactions and provide new technologies for optimizing CRISPR defense in beneficial microbes.IMPORTANCE The CRISPR-Cas system is one means by which bacterial and archaeal populations defend against viral infection which causes 20 to 50% of cell mortality in the ocean. We tested the hypothesis that certain viral genes are preferentially targeted for the initial attack of the CRISPR-Cas system on a viral genome. Using CASC, a pipeline for CRISPR spacer discovery, and metagenome data from oceanic microbes and viruses, we found a clear subset of viral genes with high match frequencies to CRISPR spacers. Moreover, we observed a many-to-many relationship of spacers and viral genes. These high-match viral genes were involved in nucleotide metabolism, DNA methylation, and viral structure. It is possible that CRISPR spacer matching is an evolutionary algorithm pointing to those viral genes most important to sustaining infection and lysis. Studying these genes may advance the understanding of virus-host interactions in nature and provide new technologies for leveraging CRISPR-Cas systems in beneficial microbes.

30835493	Enhanced agricultural production through innovative breeding technology is urgently needed to increase access to nutritious foods worldwide. Recent advances in CRISPR/Cas genome editing enable efficient targeted modification in most crops, thus promising to accelerate crop improvement. Here, we review advances in CRISPR/Cas9 and its variants and examine their applications in plant genome editing and related manipulations. We highlight base-editing tools that enable targeted nucleotide substitutions and describe the various delivery systems, particularly DNA-free methods, that have linked genome editing with crop breeding. We summarize the applications of genome editing for trait improvement, development of techniques for fine-tuning gene regulation, strategies for breeding virus resistance, and the use of high-throughput mutant libraries. We outline future perspectives for genome editing in plant synthetic biology and domestication, advances in delivery systems, editing specificity, homology-directed repair, and gene drives. Finally, we discuss the challenges and opportunities for precision plant breeding and its bright future in agriculture.	K Chen|Y Wang|R Zhang|H Zhang|C Gao
30834637	Phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) is a highly conserved reversible enzyme that participates in both glycolysis and photosynthesis. In Arabidopsis thaliana, one cytosolic PGK (PGKc) and two plastidial PGKs (PGKp) are known. It remains debatable whether the two PGKp isozymes are functionally redundant or specialized in plastidial carbon metabolism and fixation. Here, using a pooled clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) strategy, we found that plants with single mutations in pgkp1 or pgkp2 were not significantly affected, whereas a pgkp1pgkp2 double mutation was lethal due to retarded carbon fixation, suggesting that PGKp isozymes play redundant functional roles. Metabolomic analysis demonstrated that the sugar-deficient pgkp1pgkp2 double mutation was partially complemented by exogenous sugar, although respiration intermediates were not rescued. Chloroplast development was defective in pgkp1pgkp2, due to a deficiency in glycolysis-dependent galactoglycerolipid biosynthesis. Ectopic expression of a plastid targeting PGKc did not reverse the pgkp1pgkp2 double-mutant phenotypes. Therefore, PGKp1 and PGKp2 play redundant roles in carbon fixation and metabolism, whereas the molecular function of PGKc is more divergent. Our study demonstrated the functional conservation and divergence of glycolytic enzymes.	R Li|Z Qiu|X Wang|P Gong|Q Xu|QB Yu|Y Guan
30833733	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) machineries are prokaryotic immune systems that have been adapted as versatile gene editing and manipulation tools. We found that CRISPR nucleases from two families, Cpf1 (also known as Cas12a) and Cas9, exhibit differential guide RNA (gRNA) sequence requirements for cleavage of the two strands of target DNA in vitro. As a consequence of the differential gRNA requirements, both Cas9 and Cpf1 enzymes can exhibit potent nickase activities on an extensive class of mismatched double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) targets. These properties allow the production of efficient nickases for a chosen dsDNA target sequence, without modification of the nuclease protein, using gRNAs with a variety of patterns of mismatch to the intended DNA target. In parallel to the nicking activities observed with purified Cas9 in vitro, we observed sequence-dependent nicking for both perfectly matched and partially mismatched target sequences in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae system. Our findings have implications for CRISPR spacer acquisition, off-target potential of CRISPR gene editing/manipulation, and tool development using homology-directed nicking.

30833658	Adenine base editors1 enable efficient targeted adenine-to-guanine single nucleotide conversions to induce or correct point mutations in human cells, animals, and plants1-4. Here we present a modified version of Digenome-seq, an in vitro method for identifying CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-induced double-strand breaks using whole-genome sequencing5-8, to assess genome-wide target specificity of adenine base editors. To produce double-strand breaks at sites containing inosines, the products of adenine deamination, we treat human genomic DNA with an adenine base editor 7.10 protein-guide RNA complex and either endonuclease V or a combination of human alkyladenine DNA glycosylase and endonuclease VIII in vitro. Digenome-seq detects adenine base editor off-target sites with a substitution frequency of 0.1% or more. We show that adenine base editor 7.10, the cytosine base editor BE3, and unmodified CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) often recognize different off-target sites, highlighting the need for independent assessments of their genome-wide specificities6. Using targeted sequencing, we also show that use of preassembled adenine base editor ribonucleoproteins, modified guide RNAs5,8-11, and Sniper/Cas9 (ref. 12) reduces adenine base editor off-target activity in human cells.

30833558	The interactions between tumor cells with their microenvironments, including hypoxia, acidosis and immune cells, lead to the tumor heterogeneity which promotes tumor progression. Here, we show that SIAH2-NRF1 axis remodels tumor microenvironment through regulating tumor mitochondrial function, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) polarization and cell death for tumor maintenance and progression. Mechanistically, low mitochondrial gene expression in breast cancers is associated with a poor clinical outcome. The hypoxia-activated E3 ligase SIAH2 spatially downregulates nuclear-encoded mitochondrial gene expression including pyruvate dehydrogenase beta via degrading NRF1 (Nuclear Respiratory Factor 1) through ubiquitination on lysine 230, resulting in enhanced Warburg effect, metabolic reprogramming and pro-tumor immune response. Dampening NRF1 degradation under hypoxia not only impairs the polarization of TAMs, but also promotes tumor cells to become more susceptible to apoptosis in a FADD-dependent fashion, resulting in secondary necrosis due to the impairment of efferocytosis. These data represent that inhibition of NRF1 degradation is a potential therapeutic strategy against cancer.

30833354	Clostridioides difficile genetics has rapidly advanced in recent years thanks to the development of tools for allelic replacement and transposon mutagenesis. In this Journal of Bacteriology issue, Müh et al extend the genetics toolbox by developing a CRISPRi strategy for gene silencing in C. difficile (U.Müh, A. G. Pannullo, D. S. Weiss, and C. D.

The authors demonstrate the tunability and robustness of their CRISPRi system, highlight its utility in studying essential gene function, and discuss exciting new possibilities for dissecting C. difficile physiology.

30827888	Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) represent a huge reservoir of potential cancer targets. Such "onco-lncRNAs" have resisted traditional RNAi methods, but CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing now promises functional screens at high throughput and low cost. The unique biology of lncRNAs demands screening strategies distinct from protein-coding genes. The first such screens have identified hundreds of onco-lncRNAs promoting cell proliferation and drug resistance. Ongoing developments will further improve screen performance and translational relevance. This Review aims to highlight the potential of CRISPR screening technology for discovering new onco-lncRNAs, and to guide molecular oncologists wishing to apply it to their cancer of interest.

30825514	Fungal strain engineering is commonly used in many areas of biotechnology, including the production of plant biomass degrading enzymes. Its aim varies from the production of specific enzymes to overall increased enzyme production levels and modification of the composition of the enzyme set that is produced by the fungus. Strain engineering involves a diverse range of methodologies, including classical mutagenesis, genetic engineering and genome editing. In this review, the main approaches for strain engineering of filamentous fungi in the field of plant biomass degradation will be discussed, including recent and not yet implemented methods, such as CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing and adaptive evolution.

30822570	Next generation sequencing has uncovered a trove of short noncoding RNAs (e.g., microRNAs) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that act as molecular rheostats in the control of diverse homeostatic processes. Meanwhile, the tsunamic emergence of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) editing has transformed our influence over all DNA-carrying entities, heralding global CRISPRization. This is evident in biomedical research where the ease and low-cost of CRISPR editing has made it the preferred method of manipulating the mouse genome, facilitating rapid discovery of genome function in an in vivo context. Here, CRISPR genome editing components are updated for elucidating lncRNA function in mice. Various strategies are highlighted for understanding the function of lncRNAs residing in intergenic sequence space, as host genes that harbor microRNAs or other genes, and as natural antisense, overlapping or intronic genes. Also discussed is CRISPR editing of mice carrying human lncRNAs as well as the editing of competing endogenous RNAs. The information described herein should assist labs in the rigorous design of experiments that interrogate lncRNA function in mice where complex disease processes can be modeled thus accelerating translational discovery.

30820491	CRISPR-Cas systems are adaptive immune systems naturally found in bacteria and archaea. Prokaryotes use these immune systems to defend against invaders, which include phages, plasmids, and other mobile genetic elements. Relying on the integration of spacers derived from invader sequences (protospacers) into CRISPR loci (forming spacers flanked by repeats), CRISPR-Cas systems are able to store the memory of past immunological encounters. While CRISPR-Cas systems have evolved in response to invading mobile genetic elements, invaders have also developed mechanisms to avoid detection. As a result of an arms race between CRISPR-Cas systems and their targets, CRISPR arrays typically undergo rapid turnover of spacers through the acquisition and loss events. Additionally, microbiomes of different individuals rarely share spacers. Here, we present a computational pipeline, CRISPRtrack, for strain tracking based on CRISPR spacer content, and we applied it to fecal transplantation microbiome data to study the retention of donor strains in recipients. Our results demonstrate the potential use of CRISPRs as a simple yet effective tool for donor-strain tracking in fecal transplantation and as a general purpose tool for quantifying microbiome similarity.

30819783	Recent advances in synthetic biology research have been underpinned by an exponential increase in available genomic information and a proliferation of advanced DNA assembly tools. The adoption of plasmid vector assembly standards and parts libraries has greatly enhanced the reproducibility of research and the exchange of parts between different labs and biological systems. However, a standardized modular cloning (MoClo) system is not yet available for cyanobacteria, which lag behind other prokaryotes in synthetic biology despite their huge potential regarding biotechnological applications. By building on the assembly library and syntax of the Plant Golden Gate MoClo kit, we have developed a versatile system called CyanoGate that unites cyanobacteria with plant and algal systems. Here, we describe the generation of a suite of parts and acceptor vectors for making (1) marked/unmarked knock-outs or integrations using an integrative acceptor vector, and (2) transient multigene expression and repression systems using known and previously undescribed replicative vectors. We tested and compared the CyanoGate system in the established model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and the more recently described fast-growing strain Synechococcus elongatus UTEX 2973. The UTEX 2973 fast-growth phenotype was only evident under specific growth conditions; however, UTEX 2973 accumulated high levels of proteins with strong native or synthetic promoters. The system is publicly available and can be readily expanded to accommodate other standardized MoClo parts to accelerate the development of reliable synthetic biology tools for the cyanobacterial community.

30814462	We determined the whole-genome sequence (WGS) of Streptococcus canis strain TA4 harboring the M-like protein gene (scm); the strain was isolated from a human patient presenting with bacteremia. The potential of type II-A clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) array-based typing was evaluated, and the genetic relation was elucidated between spacer genogroups and scm prevalence and/or polymorphisms among the isolates from 19 diseased companion animals and the human patient. CRISPRFinder and CRISPRCasFinder detected the type II-A locus with the same repeat sequences in strain TA4 and another WGS of S. canis strain, isolated from a cow with mastitis. An optimized PCR-based amplification method was used to sequence the region covering the locus around the leader and terminal repeat sequences. Among the 20 isolates sequenced, 16 strains (including TA4) were identified with the CRISPR array. We conducted comparative analysis of the homologous spacer sequences and performed grouping based on the successive common ancestral spacer types. These 16 isolates were assigned to five genogroups (A to E) with scm being absent in genogroup A. We found a relationship between genogroups C and E and allele type 1 of the deduced M-like protein. These preliminary findings suggest the feasibility of CRISPR array-based typing and a genetic relation between the spacer genogroups and scm prevalence and/or polymorphisms in the isolates.

30811422	Molecular tools adapted from bacterial CRISPR (Clustered Regulatory Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) systems for adaptive immunity have become widely used for plant genome engineering, both to investigate gene functions and to engineer desirable traits. A number of different Cas (CRISPR-associated) nucleases are now used but, as most studies performed to date have engineered different targets using a variety of plant species and molecular tools, it has been difficult to draw conclusions about the comparative performance of different nucleases. Due to the time and effort required to regenerate engineered plants, efficiency is critical. In addition, there have been several reports of mutations at sequences with less than perfect identity to the target. While in some plant species it is possible to remove these so-called 'off-targets' by backcrossing to a parental line, the specificity of genome engineering tools is important when targeting specific members of closely-related gene families, especially when recent paralogues are co-located in the genome and unlikely to segregate. Specificity is also important for species that take years to reach sexual maturity or that are clonally propagated. Here, we directly compare the efficiency and specificity of Cas nucleases from different bacterial species together with engineered variants of Cas9. We find that the nucleotide content of the target correlates with efficiency and that Cas9 from Staphylococcus aureus (SaCas9) is comparatively most efficient at inducing mutations. We also demonstrate that 'high-fidelity' variants of Cas9 can reduce off-target mutations in plants. We present these molecular tools as standardised DNA parts to facilitate their re-use.

30807689	Many branches of biology depend on stable and predictable recombinant gene expression, which has been achieved in recent years through targeted integration of the recombinant gene into defined integration sites. However, transcriptional levels of recombinant genes in characterized integration sites are controlled by multiple components of the integrated expression cassette. Lack of readily available tools has inhibited meaningful experimental investigation of the interplay between the integration site and the expression cassette components. Here we show in a systematic manner how multiple components contribute to final net expression of recombinant genes in a characterized integration site. We develop a CRISPR/Cas9-based toolbox for construction of mammalian cell lines with targeted integration of a landing pad, containing a recombinant gene under defined 5' proximal regulatory elements. Generated site-specific recombinant cell lines can be used in a streamlined recombinase-mediated cassette exchange for fast screening of different expression cassettes. Using the developed toolbox, we show that different 5' proximal regulatory elements generate distinct and robust recombinant gene expression patterns in defined integration sites of CHO cells with a wide range of transcriptional outputs. This approach facilitates the generation of user-defined and product-specific gene expression patterns for programmable mammalian cell engineering.

30806053	The study aims to use CRISPR/Cas9 introducing foreign gene targeted knock-in into chicken EAV-HP genome. First, specific primers were designed for amplification of EAV-HP left, right homologous arms and enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) expression cassette. PCR products of homologous arms were ligated to both sides of eGFP by overlap extension PCR, resulting in full-length donor DNA fragment designated as LER. Then LER fragments were cloned into pMD19-T to obtain donor vector pMDT-LER. Subsequently, the donor vector pMDT-LER was transfected into HEK293T cells to verify the expression of eGFP gene. Furthermore, co-transfection of CRISPR/Cas9 expression vector and pMDT-LER into chicken DF-1 cells was performed to achieve eGFP transgenic cells. Meanwhile, eGFP expression was observed in cells, and the event of eGFP integration into EAV-HP genome was detectable by amplification of target DNA. Finally, the transgenic DF-1 cells were passaged seven times, and the stable integration and expression of eGFP was checked by PCR and Western blotting. These results demonstrated that eGFP gene was knocked into the EAV-HP genome successfully, which provides a new integration site for research of transgenic chicken.	本研究旨在通过CRISPR/Cas9 介导外源基因靶向插入鸡EAV-HP 基因组。首先设计特异性引物并扩增鸡内源性病毒 (EAV-HP) 左右同源臂和增强型绿色荧光蛋白 (eGFP) 基因表达盒，然后通过重叠延伸PCR 技术将两个同源臂DNA 连接至eGFP 表达盒两侧，获得全长DNA 片段LER，并克隆至pMD19-T 载体，获得携带eGFP基因的供体载体pMDT-LER。随后在HEK293T 细胞中验证供体载体pMDT-LER 能成功表达eGFP 后，将EAV-HP打靶载体和供体载体共转染至DF-1 细胞，观察绿色荧光阳性细胞，提取细胞基因组，PCR 检测外源基因eGFP成功整合至鸡基因组EAV-HP 位点。最后，将转基因细胞DF-1 传至第7 代，用PCR 和Western blotting 检测eGFP在转基因细胞中稳定表达。文中初步验证外源基因eGFP 能整合至鸡EAV-HP 位点并稳定表达，为转基因鸡的研究提供新整合位点。.

30804551	Immune-cell engineering opens new capabilities for fundamental immunology research and immunotherapy. We developed a system for efficient generation of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-engineered T cells (CAR-T cells) with considerably enhanced features by streamlined genome engineering. By leveraging trans-activating CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) RNA (tracrRNA)-independent CRISPR-Cpf1 systems with adeno-associated virus (AAV), we were able to build a stable CAR-T cell with homology-directed-repair knock-in and immune-checkpoint knockout (KIKO CAR-T cell) at high efficiency in one step. The modularity of the AAV-Cpf1 KIKO system enables flexible and highly efficient generation of double knock-in of two different CARs in the same T cell. Compared with Cas9-based methods, the AAV-Cpf1 system generates double-knock-in CAR-T cells more efficiently. CD22-specific AAV-Cpf1 KIKO CAR-T cells have potency comparable to that of Cas9 CAR-T cells in cytokine production and cancer cell killing, while expressing lower levels of exhaustion markers. This versatile system opens new capabilities of T-cell engineering with simplicity and precision.	X Dai|JJ Park|Y Du|HR Kim|G Wang|Y Errami|S Chen
30804513	CRISPR/Cas9 is a powerful genome-editing tool, but spurious off-target edits present a barrier to therapeutic applications. To understand how CRISPR/Cas9 discriminates between on-targets and off-targets, we have developed a single-molecule assay combining optical tweezers with fluorescence to monitor binding to λ-DNA. At low forces, the Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 complex binds and cleaves DNA specifically. At higher forces, numerous off-target binding events appear repeatedly at the same off-target sites in a guide-RNA-sequence-dependent manner, driven by the mechanical distortion of the DNA. Using single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) and cleavage assays, we show that DNA bubbles induce off-target binding and cleavage at these sites, even with ten mismatches, as well as at previously identified in vivo off-targets. We propose that duplex DNA destabilization during cellular processes (for example, transcription, replication, etc.) can expose these cryptic off-target sites to Cas9 activity, highlighting the need for improved off-target prediction algorithms.

30804228	Caenorhabditis elegans has two histone H3 Lys9 methyltransferases, MET-2 (SETDB1 homolog) and SET-25 (G9a/SUV39H1 related). In worms, we found simple repeat sequences primarily marked by H3K9me2, while transposable elements and silent tissue-specific genes bear H3K9me3. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in histone methyltransferase (HMT) mutants shows that MET-2-mediated H3K9me2 is necessary for satellite repeat repression, while SET-25 silences a subset of transposable elements and tissue-specific genes through H3K9me3. A genome-wide synthetic lethality screen showed that RNA processing, nuclear RNA degradation, the BRCA1/BARD1 complex, and factors mediating replication stress survival are necessary for germline viability in worms lacking MET-2 but not SET-25. Unlike set-25 mutants, met-2-null worms accumulated satellite repeat transcripts, which form RNA:DNA hybrids on repetitive sequences, additively with the loss of BRCA1 or BARD1. BRCA1/BARD1-mediated H2A ubiquitination and MET-2 deposited H3K9me2 on satellite repeats are partially interdependent, suggesting both that the loss of silencing generates BRCA-recruiting DNA damage and that BRCA1 recruitment by damage helps silence repeats. The artificial induction of MSAT1 transcripts can itself trigger damage-induced germline lethality in a wild-type background, arguing that the synthetic sterility upon BRCA1/BARD1 and H3K9me2 loss is directly linked to the DNA damage provoked by unscheduled satellite repeat transcription.

30797773	The genetic makeup of cancer cells directs oncogenesis and influences the tumor microenvironment. In this study, we massively profiled genes that functionally drive tumorigenesis using genome-scale in vivo CRISPR screens in hosts with different levels of immunocompetence. As a convergent hit from these screens, Prkar1a mutant cells are able to robustly outgrow as tumors in fully immunocompetent hosts. Functional interrogation showed that Prkar1a loss greatly altered the transcriptome and proteome involved in inflammatory and immune responses as well as extracellular protein production. Single-cell transcriptomic profiling and flow cytometry analysis mapped the tumor microenvironment of Prkar1a mutant tumors and revealed the transcriptomic alterations in host myeloid cells. Taken together, our data suggest that tumor-intrinsic mutations in Prkar1a lead to drastic alterations in the genetic program of cancer cells, thereby remodeling the tumor microenvironment.

30795761	Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) remains one of the most lethal gynecologic cancers, and its pathogenetic mechanism remains unclear. Here we show that MUC16 promotes the translocation of p120-catenin (p120ctn) to the cytoplasm and consequently activates ras homolog (Rho) GTPases RhoA/Cdc42 activation to modulate the proliferation and migration abilities of EOC cells.	We collect 94 ovarian cancer (OC) patients' tissue samples to constitute tissue microarray (TMA) and analyze the MUC16 and p120ctn expression levels. Lentivirus transfection is used to overexpress cytoplasmic tail domain (CTD) of MUC16 and CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing system is firstly used to knock out MUC16 in EOC cells. The proliferation or migration ability of cells is analyzed by MTS or migration assay.	We find that MUC16 and p120ctn are aberrantly overexpressed in 94 clinical OC samples compared with benign ovarian tumors (BOT). MUC16 is a critical inducer of the proliferation and migration of EOC cells and the CTD of MUC16 plays an important role during this process. In addition, we reveal the relationship between MUC16 and p120ctn, which has not previously been studied. We show that MUC16 promotes the translocation of p120ctn to the cytoplasm and consequently activates Rho GTPases to modulate the proliferation and migration abilities of EOC cells. The cell proliferation and migration abilities induced by MUC16 are mediated by p120ctn through RhoA/Cdc42 activation.	The highly expressed MUC16 promotes the translocation of p120ctn to the cytoplasm, where it activates RhoA/Cdc42 to modulate the proliferation and migration abilities of EOC cells. These findings may provide new targets for the treatment of EOC.	X Chen|X Li|X Wang|Q Zhu|X Wu|X Wang
30795631	CRISPR/Cas is an adaptive bacterial immune system, whose CRISPR array can actively change in response to viral infections. However, Type I-E CRISPR/Cas in E. coli (an established model system), appears not to exhibit such active adaptation, which suggests that it might have functions other than immune response. Through computational analysis, we address the involvement of the system in non-canonical functions. To assess targets of CRISPR spacers, we align them against both E. coli genome and an exhaustive (~230) set of E. coli viruses. We systematically investigate the obtained alignments, such as hit distribution with respect to genome annotation, propensity to target mRNA, the target functional enrichment, conservation of CRISPR spacers and putative targets in related bacterial genomes. We find that CRISPR spacers have a statistically highly significant tendency to target i) host compared to phage genomes, ii) one of the two DNA strands, iii) genomic dsDNA rather than mRNA, iv) transcriptionally active regions, and v) sequences (cis-regulatory elements) with slower turn-over rate compared to CRISPR spacers (trans-factors). The results suggest that the Type I-E CRISPR/Cas system has a major role in transcription regulation of endogenous genes, with a potential to rapidly rewire these regulatory interactions, with targets being selected through naïve adaptation.

30789783	Since the Framingham Heart Study solidified cholesterol as a causative agent in the development of coronary heart disease there has been an explosion of research in the field of lipidology. Many therapeutic options have come and gone as we have been refining the goals of therapy to match the mortality outcome data of large clinical trials. A new frontier has emerged with the introduction of the PCSK9 inhibitors that are able with monthly injections to lower LDL cholesterol >60% with favorable side effect profiles and recently published favorable mortality data. This ushers in a whole new era of cholesterol management. Life insurance medical directors will need to be informed of how these drugs are being used and for conditions such as homozygous hypercholesterolemia, a condition with a very high mortality risk, and for new genetic analysis of affected patients, who are not as rare as once thought. This article provides the background about the development of these drugs, their expanded indications, how they may slip through the cracks of prescription drug (Rx) database inquiries, and touches on therapies in development beyond this class of medications. Medicine is an evolving field. With the new gene editing CRISPR technology it will truly be transformational for these genetically driven conditions with the potential for curative therapy. If curative therapy comes to pass it will, of course, have favorable implications for our evolving life insurance guidelines.	AJ Tarpley
30788819	Efficient and reliable methods for gene editing are critical for the generation of loss-of-gene function stem cells and genetically modified mice. Here, we outline the application of CRISPR-Cas9 technology for gene editing in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) to generate knockout ESC chimeras for the fast-tracked analysis of gene function. Furthermore, we describe the application of gene editing directly to mouse epiblast stem cells (mEpiSCs) for modelling germ layer differentiation in vitro.

30786106	A set of unique sequences in bacterial genomes, responsible for protecting bacteria against bacteriophages, has recently been used for the genetic manipulation of specific points in the genome. These systems consist of one RNA component and one enzyme component, known as CRISPR ("clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats") and Cas9, respectively. The present review focuses on the applications of CRISPR/Cas9 technology in the development of cellular and animal models of human disease. Making a desired genetic alteration depends on the design of RNA molecules that guide endonucleases to a favorable genomic location. With the discovery of CRISPR/Cas9 technology, researchers are able to achieve higher levels of accuracy because of its advantages over alternative methods for editing genome, including a simple design, a high targeting efficiency and the ability to create simultaneous alterations in multiple sequences. These factors allow the researchers to apply this technology to creating cellular and animal models of human diseases by knock-in, knock-out and Indel mutation strategies, such as for Huntington's disease, cardiovascular disorders and cancers. Optimized CRISPR/Cas9 technology will facilitate access to valuable novel cellular and animal genetic models with respect to the development of innovative drug discovery and gene therapy.

30783971	Degenerative retinal diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and Leber's congenital amaurosis (LCA) may lead to blindness without effective treatment. With the rapid advancement of the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology, in vivo application of CRISPR/Cas9 holds immense potential for treatment of these diseases. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors are an ideal gene transfer tool for delivery of CRISPR components to the retina. Here, we describe a protocol for utilizing an AAV-based CRISPR/Cas9 system for in vivo genome editing in the retina.	W Yu|Z Wu
30782640	Large-scale genetic interaction (GI) screens in yeast have been invaluable for our understanding of molecular systems biology and for characterizing novel gene function. Owing in part to the high costs and long experiment times required, a preponderance of GI data has been generated in a single environmental condition. However, an unknown fraction of GIs may be specific to other conditions. Here, we developed a pooled-growth CRISPRi-based sequencing assay for GIs, CRISPRiSeq, which increases throughput such that GIs can be easily assayed across multiple growth conditions. We assayed the fitness of approximately 17,000 strains encompassing approximately 7700 pairwise interactions in five conditions and found that the additional conditions increased the number of GIs detected nearly threefold over the number detected in rich media alone. In addition, we found that condition-specific GIs are prevalent and improved the power to functionally classify genes. Finally, we found new links during respiratory growth between members of the Ras nutrient-sensing pathway and both the COG complex and a gene of unknown function. Our results highlight the potential of conditional GI screens to improve our understanding of cellular genetic networks.	M Jaffe|A Dziulko|JD Smith|RP St Onge|SF Levy|G Sherlock
30779043	Genome-wide screens are a powerful technique to dissect the complex network of genes regulating diverse cellular phenotypes. The recent adaptation of the CRISPR-Cas9 system for genome engineering has revolutionized functional genomic screening. Here, we present protocols used to introduce Cas9 into human lymphoma cell lines, produce high-titer lentivirus of a genome-wide sgRNA library, transduce and culture cells during the screen, isolate genomic DNA, and prepare a custom library for next-generation sequencing. These protocols were tailored for loss-of-function CRISPR screens in human lymphoma cell lines but are highly amenable for other experimental purposes.	DE Webster|S Roulland|JD Phelan
30769780	Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) hold enormous promise for regenerative medicine. The major safety concern is the tumorigenicity of transplanted cells derived from iPSCs. A potential solution would be to introduce a suicide gene into iPSCs as a safety switch. The herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) gene, in combination with ganciclovir, is the most widely used enzyme/prodrug suicide system from basic research to clinical applications. In the present study, we attempted to establish human iPSCs that stably expressed HSV-TK with either lentiviral vectors or CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing. However, this task was difficult to achieve, because high-level and/or constitutive expression of HSV-TK resulted in the induction of cell death or silencing of HSV-TK expression. A nucleotide metabolism analysis suggested that excessive accumulation of thymidine triphosphate, caused by HSV-TK expression, resulted in an imbalance in the dNTP pools. This unbalanced state led to DNA synthesis inhibition and cell death in a process similar to a "thymidine block", but more severe. We also demonstrated that the Tet-inducible system was a feasible solution for overcoming the cytotoxicity of HSV-TK expression. Our results provided a warning against using the HSV-TK gene in human iPSCs, particularly in clinical applications.

30767728	The human epigenome plays a key role in determining cellular identity and eventually function. Drug discovery undertakings have focused mainly on the role of genomics in carcinogenesis, with the focus turning to the epigenome recently. Drugs targeting DNA and histone modifications are under development with some such as 5-azacytidine, decitabine, vorinostat, and panobinostat already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). This expert review offers a critical analysis of the epigenomics-guided drug discovery and development and the opportunities and challenges for the next decade. Importantly, the coupling of epigenetic editing techniques, such as clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated protein-9 (Cas9) and APOBEC-coupled epigenetic sequencing (ACE-seq) with epigenetic drug screens, will allow the identification of small-molecule inhibitors or drugs able to reverse epigenetic changes responsible for many diseases. In addition, concrete and sustainable innovation in cancer treatment ought to integrate epigenome targeting drugs with classic therapies such as chemotherapy and immunotherapy.	K Dzobo
30762876	Lactobacillus helveticus is a homofermentative thermophilic lactic acid bacteria that is mainly used in the manufacture of Swiss type and long-ripened Italian hard cheeses. In this study, the presence of Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) were analysed in 25 L. helveticus genomes and identified in 23 of these genomes. A total of 40 CRISPR loci were identified and classified into five main families based on CRISPR repeats: Ldbu1, Lsal1, Lhel1, Lhel2 and a new repeat family named Lhel3. Spacers had a size between 30 and 40 bp whereas repeats have an average size of 30 bp, with three longer repeats. The analysis displayed the presence of conserved spacers in 23 of the 40 CRISPR loci. A geographical distribution of L. helveticus isolates with similar CRISPR spacer array profiles were not observed. Based on the presence of the signature protein Cas3, all CRISPR loci belonged to Type I. This analysis demonstrated a great CRISPR array variability within L. helveticus, which could be a useful tool for genotypic strain differentiation. A next step will be to understand the possible role of CRISPR/Cas system for the resistance of L. helveticus to phage infection. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Lactobacillus helveticus, a lactic acid bacteria species widely used as starter culture in the dairy industry has recently also gained importance as health-promoting culture in probiotic and nutraceutical food products. The CRISPR/Cas system, a well-known molecular mechanism that provides adaptive immunity against exogenous genetic elements such as bacteriophages and plasmids in bacteria, was recently found in this species. In this study, we investigated the presence and genetic heterogeneity of CRISPR loci in 25 L. helveticus genomes. The results presented here represent an important step on the way to manage phage resistance, plasmid uptake and genome editing in this species.

30747803	This article explores the origin of the first cellular structures, briefly examines the process of evolution, explores some of the earlier challenges in human gene editing, explains how bacterial immune systems have provided the secret to a very powerful gene editing tool, and finally explores some of the very troubling ethical issues emerging with gene editing.

30745377	Here we introduce plasmids for xylose-regulated expression and repression of genes in Clostridioides difficile The xylose-inducible expression vector allows for ∼100-fold induction of an mCherryOpt reporter gene. Induction is titratable and uniform from cell to cell. The gene repression plasmid is a CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) system based on a nuclease-defective, codon-optimized allele of the Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 protein (dCas9) that is targeted to a gene of interest by a constitutively expressed single guide RNA (sgRNA). Expression of dCas9 is induced by xylose, allowing investigators to control the timing and extent of gene silencing, as demonstrated here by dose-dependent repression of a chromosomal gene for a red fluorescent protein (maximum repression, ∼100-fold). To validate the utility of CRISPRi for deciphering gene function in C. difficile, we knocked down the expression of three genes involved in the biogenesis of the cell envelope: the cell division gene ftsZ, the S-layer protein gene slpA, and the peptidoglycan synthase gene pbp-0712 CRISPRi confirmed known or expected phenotypes associated with the loss of FtsZ and SlpA and revealed that the previously uncharacterized peptidoglycan synthase PBP-0712 is needed for proper elongation, cell division, and protection against lysis.IMPORTANCEClostridioides difficile has become the leading cause of hospital-acquired diarrhea in developed countries. A better understanding of the basic biology of this devastating pathogen might lead to novel approaches for preventing or treating C. difficile infections. Here we introduce new plasmid vectors that allow for titratable induction (P xyl) or knockdown (CRISPRi) of gene expression. The CRISPRi plasmid allows for easy depletion of target proteins in C. difficile Besides bypassing the lengthy process of mutant construction, CRISPRi can be used to study the function of essential genes, which are particularly important targets for antibiotic development.

30735352	Activating mutations in RAS can lead to oncogenesis by enhancing downstream signaling, such as through the MAPK and PI3K pathways. Therefore, therapeutically targeting RAS may perturb multiple signaling pathways simultaneously. One method for modulating RAS signaling is to target the activity of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor SOS1. Our laboratory has discovered compounds that bind to SOS1 and activate RAS. Interestingly, these SOS1 agonist compounds elicit biphasic modulation of ERK phosphorylation and simultaneous inhibition of AKT phosphorylation levels. Here, we utilized multiple chemically distinct compounds to elucidate whether these effects on MAPK and PI3K signaling by SOS1 agonists were mechanistically linked. In addition, we used CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing to generate clonally derived SOS1 knockout cells and identified a potent SOS1 agonist that rapidly elicited on-target molecular effects at substantially lower concentrations than those causing off-target effects. Our findings will allow us to further define the on-target utility of SOS1 agonists.	DT Akan|JE Howes|J Sai|AL Arnold|Y Beesetty|J Phan|ET Olejniczak|AG Waterson|SW Fesik
30729184	Presence of the integrated endogenous banana streak virus (eBSV) in the B genome of plantain (AAB) is a major challenge for breeding and dissemination of hybrids. As the eBSV activates into infectious viral particles under stress, the progenitor Musa balbisiana and its derivants, having at least one B genome, cannot be used as parents for crop improvement. Here, we report a strategy to inactivate the eBSV by editing the virus sequences. The regenerated genome-edited events of Gonja Manjaya showed mutations in the targeted sites with the potential to prevent proper transcription or/and translational into functional viral proteins. Seventy-five percent of the edited events remained asymptomatic in comparison to the non-edited control plants under water stress conditions, confirming inactivation of eBSV into infectious viral particles. This study paves the way for the improvement of B genome germplasm and its use in breeding programs to produce hybrids that can be globally disseminated.

30728358	Elevated MYC expression sensitizes tumor cells to apoptosis but the therapeutic potential of this mechanism remains unclear. We find, in a model of MYC-driven breast cancer, that pharmacological activation of AMPK strongly synergizes with BCL-2/BCL-XL inhibitors to activate apoptosis. We demonstrate the translational potential of an AMPK and BCL-2/BCL-XL co-targeting strategy in ex vivo and in vivo models of MYC-high breast cancer. Metformin combined with navitoclax or venetoclax efficiently inhibited tumor growth, conferred survival benefits and induced tumor infiltration by immune cells. However, withdrawal of the drugs allowed tumor re-growth with presentation of PD-1+/CD8+ T cell infiltrates, suggesting immune escape. A two-step treatment regimen, beginning with neoadjuvant metformin+venetoclax to induce apoptosis and followed by adjuvant metformin+venetoclax+anti-PD-1 treatment to overcome immune escape, led to durable antitumor responses even after drug withdrawal. We demonstrate that pharmacological reactivation of MYC-dependent apoptosis is a powerful antitumor strategy involving both tumor cell depletion and immunosurveillance.

30710789	Chromatin conformation, localization, and dynamics are crucial regulators of cellular behaviors. Although fluorescence in situ hybridization-based techniques have been widely utilized for investigating chromatin architectures in healthy and diseased states, the requirement for cell fixation precludes the comprehensive dynamic analysis necessary to fully understand chromatin activities. This has spurred the development and application of a variety of imaging methodologies for visualizing single chromosomal loci in the native cellular context. In this review, we describe currently-available approaches for imaging single genomic loci in cells, with special focus on clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based imaging approaches. In addition, we discuss some of the challenges that limit the application of CRISPR-based genomic imaging approaches, and potential solutions to address these challenges. We anticipate that, with continued refinement of CRISPR-based imaging techniques, significant understanding can be gained to help decipher chromatin activities and their relevance to cellular physiology and pathogenesis.

30710386	Over the past decade, genome-wide association studies have contributed a wealth of knowledge to our understanding of polygenic disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. As the size of sample cohorts has improved so too have the computational and experimental methods used to robustly define variants associated with disease susceptibility. The challenge now remains to translate these findings into improved understanding of disease aetiology and patient care. Whilst much of the focus of translating the findings of genome-wide association studies has been on global analysis of all variants identified, careful functional study of individual disease susceptibility loci will be required in order to refine our understanding of how individual variants contribute to disease risk. Here, we present the argument behind such an approach and describe some of the novel tools being used to investigate risk loci. This includes the use of chromosomal conformation capture techniques and modifications of the CRISPR-Cas9 system, with several examples of their implementation being described.	J Ding|G Orozco

30709710	CRISPR-Cas immunity requires integration of short, foreign DNA fragments into the host genome at the CRISPR locus, a site consisting of alternating repeat sequences and foreign-derived spacers. In most CRISPR systems, the proteins Cas1 and Cas2 form the integration complex and are both essential for DNA acquisition. Most type V-C and V-D systems lack the cas2 gene and have unusually short CRISPR repeats and spacers. Here, we show that a mini-integrase comprising the type V-C Cas1 protein alone catalyzes DNA integration with a preference for short (17- to 19-base-pair) DNA fragments. The mini-integrase has weak specificity for the CRISPR array. We present evidence that the Cas1 proteins form a tetramer for integration. Our findings support a model of a minimal integrase with an internal ruler mechanism that favors shorter repeats and spacers. This minimal integrase may represent the function of the ancestral Cas1 prior to Cas2 adoption.	AV Wright|JY Wang|D Burstein|LB Harrington|D Paez-Espino|NC Kyrpides|AT Iavarone|JF Banfield|JA Doudna

We also outline the current socio-political landscape for CRISPR/Cas research and highlight the growing need for governments to better facilitate research into plant genetic-editing technologies.

30703321	Mobile genetic elements drive evolution by disrupting genes and rearranging genomes. Eukaryotes have evolved epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation and RNA interference, that silence mobile elements and thereby preserve the integrity of their genomes. We created an artificial reprogrammable epigenetic system based on CRISPR interference to give engineered bacteria a similar line of defense against transposons and other selfish elements in their genomes. We demonstrate that this CRISPR interference against mobile elements (CRISPRi-ME) approach can be used to simultaneously repress two different transposon families in Escherichia coli, thereby increasing the evolutionary stability of costly protein expression. We further show that silencing a transposon in Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 reduces mutation rates by a factor of 5, nearly as much as deleting all copies of this element from its genome. By deploying CRISPRi-ME on a broad-host-range vector, we have created a generalizable platform for stabilizing the genomes of engineered bacterial cells for applications in metabolic engineering and synthetic biology.

30701488	MicroRNAs play important roles in posttranscriptional regulation of plant development, metabolism, and abiotic stress responses. The recent generation of massive amounts of small RNA sequence data, along with development of bioinformatic tools to identify miRNAs and their mRNA targets, has led to an explosion of newly identified putative miRNAs in plants. Genome editing techniques like CRISPR-Cas9 will allow us to study the biological role of these potential novel miRNAs by efficiently targeting both the miRNA and its mRNA target. In this chapter, we review bioinformatic tools and experimental methods for the identification and functional characterization of miRNAs and their target mRNAs in plants.	A Armenta-Medina|CS Gillmor
30700234	Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) in combination with CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing provide unparalleled opportunities to study cardiac biology and disease. However, sarcomeres, the fundamental units of myocyte contraction, are immature and nonlinear in hiPSC-CMs, which technically challenge accurate functional interrogation of contractile parameters in beating cells. Furthermore, existing analysis methods are relatively low-throughput, indirectly assess contractility, or only assess well-aligned sarcomeres found in mature cardiac tissues.	We aimed to develop an analysis platform that directly, rapidly, and automatically tracks sarcomeres in beating cardiomyocytes. The platform should assess sarcomere content, contraction and relaxation parameters, and beat rate.	We developed SarcTrack, a MatLab software that monitors fluorescently tagged sarcomeres in hiPSC-CMs. The algorithm determines sarcomere content, sarcomere length, and returns rates of sarcomere contraction and relaxation. By rapid measurement of hundreds of sarcomeres in each hiPSC-CM, SarcTrack provides large data sets for robust statistical analyses of multiple contractile parameters. We validated SarcTrack by analyzing drug-treated hiPSC-CMs, confirming the contractility effects of compounds that directly activate (CK-1827452) or inhibit (MYK-461) myosin molecules or indirectly alter contractility (verapamil and propranolol). SarcTrack analysis of hiPSC-CMs carrying a heterozygous truncation variant in the myosin-binding protein C (MYBPC3) gene, which causes hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, recapitulated seminal disease phenotypes including cardiac hypercontractility and diminished relaxation, abnormalities that normalized with MYK-461 treatment.	SarcTrack provides a direct and efficient method to quantitatively assess sarcomere function. By improving existing contractility analysis methods and overcoming technical challenges associated with functional evaluation of hiPSC-CMs, SarcTrack enhances translational prospects for sarcomere-regulating therapeutics and accelerates interrogation of human cardiac genetic variants.

30696954	Cancer is caused by a series of alterations in genome and epigenome and exists in multiple complex forms, making it difficult to be prevented and/or treated. Telomerase, an enzyme responsible for the maintenance of telomere, is silent in most normal somatic cells but activated in 90% of cancer cells, making it an excellent target for cancer therapy. Therefore, various telomerase activity inhibitors have been developed to treat cancer but all failed due to side effects. Here we acted oppositely to develop a cancer gene therapy named telomerase-activating gene expression (Tage) system by utilizing the telomerase activity in cancer cells. The Tage system consisted of an effector gene expression vector that carried a 3' telomerase-recognizable stick end and an artificial transcription factor expression vector that could express dCas9-VP64 and an sgRNA targeting telomere repeat sequences. By using Cas9 as an effector gene, the Tage system effectively killed various cancer cells, including HepG2, HeLa, PANC-1, MDA-MB-453, A549, HT-29, SKOV-3, Hepa1-6, and RAW264.7, without affecting normal cells MRC-5, HL7702, and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC). More importantly, a four-base 3' stick end produced by the homothallic switching endonuclease in cells could be recognized by telomerase, allowing the Tage system to effectively kill cancer cells in vivo. The Tage system could effectively and safely realize its in vivo application by using adeno-associated virus (AAV) as gene vector. The virus-loaded Tage system could significantly and specifically kill cancer cells in mice by intravenous drug administration without side effects or toxicity.	W Dai|X Xu|D Wang|J Wu|J Wang
30692669	Type III-A CRISPR-Cas systems employ the Cas10-Csm complex to destroy bacteriophages and plasmids, using a guide RNA to locate complementary RNA molecules from the invader and trigger an immune response that eliminates the infecting DNA. In addition, these systems possess the non-specific RNase Csm6, which provides further protection for the host. While the role of Csm6 in immunity during phage infection has been determined, how this RNase is used against plasmids is unclear. Here, we show that Staphylococcus epidermidis Csm6 is required for immunity when transcription across the plasmid target is infrequent, leading to impaired target recognition and inefficient DNA degradation by the Cas10-Csm complex. In these conditions, Csm6 causes growth arrest in the host and prevents further plasmid replication through the indiscriminate degradation of host and plasmid transcripts. In contrast, when plasmid target sequences are efficiently transcribed, Csm6 is dispensable and DNA degradation by Cas10 is sufficient for anti-plasmid immunity. Csm6 therefore provides robustness to the type III-A CRISPR-Cas immune response against difficult targets for the Cas10-Csm complex.	JT Rostøl|LA Marraffini
30691655	Type I, II, and V CRISPR-Cas systems are RNA-guided dsDNA targeting defense mechanisms found in bacteria and archaea. During CRISPR interference, Cas effectors use CRISPR-derived RNAs (crRNAs) as guides to bind complementary sequences in foreign dsDNA, leading to the cleavage and destruction of the DNA target. Mutations within the target or in the protospacer adjacent motif can reduce the level of CRISPR interference, although the level of defect is dependent on the type and position of the mutation, as well as the guide sequence of the crRNA. Given the importance of Cas effectors in host defense and for biotechnology tools, there has been considerable interest in developing sensitive methods for detecting Cas effector activity through CRISPR interference. In this chapter, we describe an in vivo fluorescence-based method for monitoring plasmid interference in Escherichia coli. This approach uses a green fluorescent protein reporter to monitor varying plasmid levels within bacterial colonies, or to measure the rate of plasmid-loss in bacterial populations over time. We demonstrate the use of this simple plasmid-loss assay for both chromosomally integrated and plasmid-borne CRISPR-Cas systems.	PT Phan|M Schelling|C Xue|DG Sashital
30691654	Fluorescent labeling of proteins is a critical requirement for single-molecule imaging studies. Many protein labeling strategies require harsh conditions or large epitopes that can inactivate the target protein, either by decreasing the protein's enzymatic activity or by blocking protein-protein interactions. Here, we provide a detailed protocol to efficiently label CRISPR-Cas complexes with a small fluorescent peptide via sortase-mediated transpeptidation. The sortase tag consists of just a few amino acids that are specifically recognized at either the N- or the C-terminus, making this strategy advantageous when the protein is part of a larger complex. Sortase is active at high ionic strength, 4°C, and with a broad range of organic fluorophores. We discuss the design, optimization, and single-molecule fluorescent imaging of CRISPR-Cas complexes on DNA curtains. Sortase-mediated transpeptidation is a versatile addition to the protein labeling toolkit.	KE Dillard|JM Schaub|MW Brown|FA Saifuddin|Y Xiao|E Hernandez|SD Dahlhauser|EV Anslyn|A Ke|IJ Finkelstein
30691653	CRISPR adaptation is the initial step in CRISPR-Cas immunity and involves the acquisition of foreign invading DNA. Acquisition is facilitated by the almost universally conserved proteins Cas1 and Cas2, which form an adaptation complex. The Cas1-Cas2 complex binds fragments of invading DNA, completes final processing, and catalyzes integration into specific host loci called CRISPR arrays. Structural and biochemical studies from reconstituted complexes have provided mechanistic insight into how CRISPR adaptation occurs; however, these studies have been limited to a narrow subset of CRISPR-Cas types and may not be representative of the other types. Here we describe methods for the purification of the type I-F CRISPR adaptation complex (Cas1:Cas2-3) from Pectobacterium atrosepticum, purification of the DNA architectural protein integration host factor (IHF), and a sensitive PCR-based in vitro integration assay. This assay could easily be used to investigate mechanisms of CRISPR adaptation in other CRISPR-Cas systems, including the roles of accessory proteins.

30691652	Phages are the most abundant entities in the biosphere and profoundly impact the bacterial populations within and around us. They attach to a specific host, inject their DNA, hijack the host's cellular processes, and replicate exponentially while destroying the host. Historically, phages have been exploited as powerful antimicrobials, and phage-derived proteins have constituted the basis for numerous biotechnological applications. Only in recent years have metagenomic studies revealed that phage genomes harbor a rich reservoir of genetic diversity, which might afford further therapeutic and/or biotechnological value. Nevertheless, functions for the majority of phage genes remain unknown, and due to their swift and destructive replication cycle, many phages are intractable by current genetic engineering techniques. Whether to advance the basic understanding of phage biology or to tap into their potential applications, efficient methods for phage genetic engineering are needed. Recent reports have shown that CRISPR-Cas systems, a class of prokaryotic immune systems that protect against phage infection, can be harnessed to engineer diverse phages. In this chapter, we describe methods to genetically manipulate virulent phages using CRISPR-Cas10, a Type III-A CRISPR-Cas system native to Staphylococcus epidermidis. A method for engineering phages that infect a CRISPR-less Staphylococcus aureus host is also described. Both approaches have proved successful in isolating desired phage mutants with 100% efficiency, demonstrating that CRISPR-Cas10 constitutes a powerful tool for phage genetic engineering. The relatively widespread presence of Type III CRISPR-Cas systems in bacteria and archaea imply that similar strategies may be used to manipulate the genomes of diverse prokaryotic viruses.

30691647	Type I CRISPR-Cas, the most prevalent CRISPR system, features a sequential target searching and degradation process. First, the multisubunit surveillance complex Cascade recognizes the matching dsDNA target flanked by protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), promotes the heteroduplex formation between CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and the target strand (TS) DNA, and displaces the nontarget strand (NTS) DNA, resulting in R-loop formation. The helicase-nuclease fusion enzyme Cas3 is then specifically recruited to Cascade/R-loop, nicks, and processively degrades the DNA target. Here, by using Type I-E CRISPR-Cas system from Thermobifida fusca, we provide protocols for the biochemical reconstitution of the Cascade/R-loop and Cascade/R-loop/Cas3 complexes that allowed for high-resolution structure determination and mechanism investigation. The procedures may be applicable for structural and mechanistic investigations of other Type I CRISPR-Cas systems, and may serve as a reference for the study of other multicomponent protein-nucleic acid complexes.

30691643	Type III CRISPR effector complexes utilize a bound CRISPR RNA (crRNA) to detect the presence of RNA from invading mobile genetic elements in the cell. This RNA binding results in the activation of two enzymatic domains of the Cas10 subunit-the HD nuclease domain, which degrades DNA, and PALM/cyclase domain. The latter synthesizes cyclic oligoadenylate (cOA) molecules by polymerizing ATP, and cOA acts as a second messenger in the cell, switching on the antiviral response by activating host ribonucleases and other proteins. In this chapter, we focus on the methods required to study the biochemistry of this recently discovered cOA signaling pathway. We cover protein expression and purification, synthesis of cOA and its linear analogues, kinetic analysis of cOA synthesis and cOA-stimulated ribonuclease activity, and small molecule detection and identification with thin-layer chromatography and mass spectrometry. The methods described are based on our recent studies of the type III CRISPR system in Sulfolobus solfataricus, but are widely applicable to other type III systems.

30691642	The CRISPR-Cas system is the prokaryotic immune response that destroys invading foreign nucleic acids. Based on the architecture and distinct mechanism of targeting, the CRISPR-Cas system is classified into six types (I-VI). The Csm complex belongs to the type III system and consists of five subunits (Cas10 and Csm2-5) and a crRNA. The Csm complex targets RNA and RNA-dependent single-strand DNA. Here, we present a protocol for in vitro reconstitution of a Csm complex from a hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus onnurineus NA1 (ToCsm complex). The method consists of coexpression and copurification of the subunits, in vitro synthesis of the crRNA and assembly of the ToCsm complex. Purification with heat treatment and affinity and size exclusion chromatography resulted in homogeneous Cas10/Csm4 and Csm2/Csm5 binary complexes, while in vitro transcription with the T7 promoter enabled synthesis of the crRNA. Addition of each component in the presence of the crRNA with a molar ratio of Cas10/Csm4:Csm3:Csm2/Csm5:crRNA=1:3:2:1 yielded an assembled functional Csm complex. This protocol for reconstitution of the Csm complex is presumably applicable to other thermostable effector complexes, which would allow biochemical, structural, or functional studies of the CRISPR-Cas type III/A system in vitro.

30691641	Type I CRISPR-Cas systems utilize small CRISPR RNA (crRNA) molecules to scan DNA strands for target regions. Different crRNAs are bound by several CRISPR-associated (Cas) protein subunits that form the stable ribonucleoprotein complex Cascade. The Cascade-mediated DNA surveillance process requires a sufficient degree of base-complementarity between crRNA and target sequences and relies on the recognition of small DNA motifs, termed protospacer adjacent motifs. Recently, super-resolution microscopy and single-particle tracking methods have been developed to follow individual protein complexes in live cells. Here, we described how this technology can be adapted to visualize the DNA scanning process of Cascade assemblies in Escherichia coli cells. The activity of recombinant Type I-Fv Cascade complexes of Shewanella putrefaciens CN-32 serves as a model system that facilitates comparative studies for many of the diverse CRISPR-Cas systems.

30691640	The specificity of CRISPR-Cas systems for nucleic acid targets is determined by a combination of binding and cleavage. Understanding the mechanisms by which Cas proteins specifically select their targets is critical for the development of CRISPR-Cas systems for biotechnology applications. Moreover, the specificity of CRISPR-Cas systems plays an important role in prokaryote evolution due to its role in distinguishing self from nonself. Here, I describe Library-ChIP, a high-throughput method for measuring Cas protein occupancy at many DNA sequence variants in a native prokaryotic host. Library-ChIP can be used to identify the determinants of specificity for Cas protein binding to nucleic acid targets.	JT Wade
30691639	Pervasive application of CRISPR-Cas systems in genome editing has prompted an increase in both interest and necessity to further elucidate existing systems as well as discover putative novel systems. The ubiquity and power of current computational platforms have made in silico approaches to CRISPR-Cas identification and characterization accessible to a wider audience and increasingly amenable for processing extensive data sets. Here, we describe in silico methods for predicting and visualizing notable features of CRISPR-Cas systems, including Cas domain determination, CRISPR array visualization, and inference of the protospacer-adjacent motif. The efficiency of these tools enables rapid exploration of CRISPR-Cas diversity across prokaryotic genomes and supports scalable analysis of large genomic data sets.	MA Nethery|R Barrangou
30691408	Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is a major human pathogen, which is associated with a wide spectrum of invasive diseases, such as pharyngitis, scarlet fever, rheumatic fever, and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS). It is hypothesized that differences in GAS pathogenicity are related to the acquisition of diverse bacteriophages (phages). Nevertheless, the GAS genome also harbors clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated (cas) genes, which play an important role in eliminating foreign DNA, including those of phages. However, the structure of prophages in GAS strains is mosaic, and the phylogenetic relationship between prophages and CRISPR is not clear. In this study, we analyzed CRISPR and prophage structure using 118 complete genome sequences of GAS strains to elucidate the relationship between two genomic elements. Additionally, phylogenetic and M-type analyses were performed.	Of the 118 GAS strains, 80 harbored type I-C and/or II-A CRISPR/cas loci. A total of 553 spacer sequences were identified from CRISPR/cas loci and sorted into 229 patterns. We identified and classified 373 prophages into 14 groups. Some prophage groups shared a common integration site, and were related to M-type. We further investigated the correlation between spacer sequences and prophages. Of the 229 spacer sequence patterns, 203 were similar to that of other GAS prophages. No spacer showed similarity with that of a specific prophage group with mutL integration site. Moreover, the average number of prophages in strains with type II-A CRISPR was significantly less than that in type I-C CRISPR and non-CRISPR strains. However, there was no statistical difference between the average number of prophages in type I-C strains and that in non-CRISPR strains.	Our results indicated that type II-A CRISPR may play an important role in eliminating phages and that the prophage integration site may be an important criterion for the acceptance of foreign DNA by GAS. M type, spacer sequence, and prophage group data were correlated with the phylogenetic relationships of GAS. Therefore, we hypothesize that genetic characteristics and/or phylogenetic relationships of GAS may be estimated by analyzing its spacer sequences.

30689007	Recent advances in DNA sequencing technology have enabled researchers to identify the genetic background underlying human illness. In addition, the latest genome editing technology, CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and CRISPR-associated protein 9), provides great potential to edit genomic DNA sequences precisely with high efficiency. This technology has been evaluated for treatment of genetic diseases in recently published preclinical studies. Since many such genetic disorders can affect functional structures in the head and neck area, the technology bears high therapeutic potential in otorhinolaryngology.	In this article, we summarize the concept of CRISPR-Cas9-based therapies, recent achievements in preclinical applications, and future challenges for the implementation of this technology in otolaryngology.	Genetic targeting strategies were analyzed or established using genome sequencing data derived from online databases and literature.	Recent research on animal models has shown that genome editing can be used to treat genetic diseases by specifically targeting mutant genomic loci. For example, one preclinical study in the field of otolaryngology has demonstrated that inherited autosomal dominant deafness in mice can be treated using CRISPR-Cas9. Moreover, the same strategies can be used to establish applications for the treatment of head and neck cancer. The greatest challenge appears to be establishment of a system for the safe and efficient delivery of therapeutic nucleotides in clinics.	In theory, genome editing could be used in otolaryngology to target disease-causing genomic loci specifically. However, various challenges have to be overcome until applications can be used clinically.	F Oppel|M Schürmann|S Shao|B Kaltschmidt|C Kaltschmidt|H Sudhoff
30688650	Cell lineages provide the framework for understanding how cell fates are decided during development. Describing cell lineages in most organisms is challenging; even a fruit fly larva has ~50,000 cells and a small mammal has >1 billion cells. Recently, the idea of applying CRISPR to induce mutations during development, to be used as heritable markers for lineage reconstruction, has been proposed by several groups. While an attractive idea, its practical value depends on the accuracy of the cell lineages that can be generated. Here, we use computer simulations to estimate the performance of these approaches under different conditions. We incorporate empirical data on CRISPR-induced mutation frequencies in Drosophila. We show significant impacts from multiple biological and technical parameters - variable cell division rates, skewed mutational outcomes, target dropouts and different sequencing strategies. Our approach reveals the limitations of published CRISPR recorders, and indicates how future implementations can be optimised.	This article has been through an editorial process in which the authors decide how to respond to the issues raised during peer review. The Reviewing Editor's assessment is that all the issues have been addressed (see decision letter).	I Salvador-Martínez|M Grillo|M Averof|MJ Telford
30686782	Gene editing technologies are used to specifically edit the target sequence. With the development of zinc finger nuclease (ZFN), transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN), regular clustering of short palindrome repeats (CRISPR) and single base editing (BE) techniques, gene editing technologies not only provide powerful tools for gene functional studies, but also offer new therapeutic strategies in biomedical research. Gene editing has demonstrated broad application prospects in the gene therapy field, as well as in the construction of animal and cell models, drug target screening and gene functional research. In this review, we summarize several typical gene editing technologies, their characteristics and applications in gene therapy and discusses their opportunities and challenges in gene therapy, thereby providing critical insights and references on the clinical application of gene editing technologies.

30685869	The treatment of human diseases using gene-editing technology has been envisioned for several decades with the realisation that so many were associated with mutations in DNA. The Human Genome Project opened new doors for identifying the genetic bases for human suffering. Research on gene editing has been active since the 1970s, but the technology has seen substantial growth and application just within the past decade. Simply stated, CRISPR technology has become a phenomenon in both biomedical and therapeutics research. Concurrently, cell therapies and pluripotent stem cell research have also been refined and now interfaced with CRISPR technology to enhance and maximise their potential in modelling as well as treatment of human diseases. In this review, we discuss the novel and revolutionary modality of gene editing, as this marks a new era in research and medicine. We also discuss gene-modifying technologies leading to CRISPR, as they are still being used for a wide variety of genomic applications. The modes and challenges for delivery of gene editing components are also discussed. Lastly, we review examples of human diseases that are not only amenable to gene editing techniques, but also show true promise of cure in the early 21st century of genetic correction and gene repair.

30684591	Cancer is a genetic disease stemming from cumulative genetic/epigenetic aberrations. Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9-mediated genome editing technology has been extensively applied in various cell types and organisms, both in vitro and in vivo, for efficient gene disruption and gene modification. CRISPR-Cas9 has shown great promise for the treatment of cancer. However, despite its advantages and tremendous potential, numerous challenges, such as fitness of edited cells, editing efficiency, delivery methods and potential off-target effects, remain to be solved for completely clinical application. Here, we present the potential applications and recent advances of CRISPR-Cas9 in cancer therapy, and discuss the challenges that might be encountered in clinical applications.

30683865	RNA-guided nucleases of the CRISPR/Cas type can be repurposed as programmable nucleotide deaminases to mediate targeted nucleotide substitutions. Such base editors have enormous potential in genome editing, gene therapy and precision breeding. However, current editors suffer from limited specificity in that they edit different and/or multiple bases within a larger sequence window. Using cytidine deaminase base editors that elicit C-to-T mutations, we show here that high editing precision can be achieved by engineering the connection between the deaminase domain and the Cas domain of the editor. By systematically testing different linker sequences and removing non-essential sequences from the deaminase, we obtain high-precision base editors with narrow activity windows that can selectively edit a single cytidine at a specific position with high accuracy and efficiency. These base editors will enable the use of genome editing in applications where single-nucleotide changes are required and off-target editing of adjacent nucleotides is not tolerable.

30683138	Genome-wide loss-of-function screens using the CRISPR/Cas9 system allow the efficient discovery of cancer cell vulnerabilities. While several studies have focused on correcting for DNA cleavage toxicity biases associated with copy number alterations, the effects of sgRNAs co-targeting multiple genomic loci in CRISPR screens have not been discussed.	In this work, we analyze CRISPR essentiality screen data from 391 cancer cell lines to characterize biases induced by multi-target sgRNAs. We investigate two types of multi-targets: on-targets predicted through perfect sequence complementarity and off-targets predicted through sequence complementarity with up to two nucleotide mismatches. We find that the number of on-targets and off-targets both increase sgRNA activity in a cell line-specific manner and that existing additive models of gene knockout effects fail at capturing genetic interactions that may occur between co-targeted genes. We use synthetic lethality between paralog genes to show that genetic interactions can introduce biases in essentiality scores estimated from multi-target sgRNAs. We further show that single-mismatch tolerant sgRNAs can confound the analysis of gene essentiality and lead to incorrect co-essentiality functional networks. Lastly, we also find that single nucleotide polymorphisms located in protospacer regions can impair on-target activity as a result of mismatch tolerance.	We show the impact of multi-target effects on estimating cancer cell dependencies and the impact of off-target effects caused by mismatch tolerance in sgRNA-DNA binding.

30681833	CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) via target guide RNA (gRNA) arrays and a deactivated Cas9 (dCas9) protein has been shown to simultaneously repress expression of multiple genomic DNA loci. By knocking down endogenous genes in competing pathways, CRISPRi technology can be utilized to redirect metabolic flux toward target metabolite. In this study, we constructed a CRISPRi-mediated multiplex repression system to silence transcription of several endogenous genes to increase precursor availability in a heterologous isopentenol biosynthesis pathway. To identify genomic knockdown targets in competing pathways, we first designed a single-gRNA library with 15 individual targets, where 3 gRNA cassettes targeting gene asnA, prpE, and gldA increased isopentenol titer by 18-24%. We then combined the 3 single-gRNA cassettes into a two- or three-gRNA array and observed up to 98% enhancement in production by fine-tuning the repression level through titrating dCas9 expression. Our strategy shows that multiplex combinatorial knockdown of competing genes using CRISPRi can increase production of the target metabolite, while the repression level needs to be adjusted to balance the metabolic network and achieve the maximum titer improvement.

30674877	Excitatory synapse formation during development involves the complex orchestration of both structural and functional alterations at the postsynapse. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie excitatory synaptogenesis are only partially resolved, in part because the internal machinery of developing synapses is largely unknown. To address this, we apply a chemicogenetic approach, in vivo biotin identification (iBioID), to discover aspects of the proteome of nascent synapses. This approach uncovered sixty proteins, including a previously uncharacterized protein, CARMIL3, which interacts in vivo with the synaptic cytoskeletal regulator proteins SrGAP3 (or WRP) and actin capping protein. Using new CRISPR-based approaches, we validate that endogenous CARMIL3 is localized to developing synapses where it facilitates the recruitment of capping protein and is required for spine structural maturation and AMPAR recruitment associated with synapse unsilencing. Together these proteomic and functional studies reveal a previously unknown mechanism important for excitatory synapse development in the developing perinatal brain.

30673820	Covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) of hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the major cause of viral persistence and chronic hepatitis B. CRISPR/Cas9 nucleases can specifically target HBV cccDNA for decay, but off-target effects of nucleases in the human genome limit their clinical utility. CRISPR/Cas9 systems from four different species were co-expressed in cell lines with guide RNAs targeting conserved regions of the HBV genome. CRISPR/Cas9 systems from Streptococcus pyogenes (Sp) and Streptococcus thermophilus (St) targeting conserved regions of the HBV genome blocked HBV replication and, most importantly, resulted in degradation of over 90% of HBV cccDNA by 6 days post-transfection. Degradation of HBV cccDNA was impaired by inhibition of non-homologous end-joining pathway and resulted in an erroneous repair of HBV cccDNA. HBV cccDNA methylation also affected antiviral activity of CRISPR/Cas9. Single-nucleotide HBV genetic variants did not impact anti-HBV activity of St CRISPR/Cas9, suggesting its utility in targeting many HBV variants. However, two or more mismatches impaired or blocked CRISPR/Cas9 activity, indicating that host DNA will not likely be targeted. Deep sequencing revealed that Sp CRISPR/Cas9 induced off-target mutagenesis, whereas St CRISPR/Cas9 had no effect on the host genome. St CRISPR/Cas9 system represents the safest system with high anti-HBV activity.	D Kostyushev|S Brezgin|A Kostyusheva|D Zarifyan|I Goptar|V Chulanov
30673818	We summarize recent progress of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene targeting in plants, provide recommendations for designing gene-targeting vectors and highlight the potential of new technologies applicable to plants. Gene targeting (GT) is a tool of urgent need for plant biotechnology and breeding. It is based on homologous recombination that is able to precisely introduce desired modifications within a target locus. However, its low efficiency in higher plants is a major barrier for its application. Using site-specific nucleases, such as the recent CRISPR/Cas system, GT has become applicable in plants, via the induction of double-strand breaks, although still at a too low efficiency for most practical applications in crops. Recently, a variety of promising new improvements regarding the efficiency of GT has been reported by several groups. It turns out that GT can be enhanced by cell-type-specific expression of Cas nucleases, by the use of self-amplified GT-vector DNA or by manipulation of DNA repair pathways. Here, we highlight the most recent progress of GT in plants. Moreover, we provide suggestions on how to use the technology efficiently, based on the mechanisms of DNA repair, and highlight several of the newest GT strategies in yeast or mammals that are potentially applicable to plants. Using the full potential of GT technology will definitely help us pave the way in enhancing crop yields and food safety for an ecologically friendly agriculture.	TK Huang|H Puchta
30669273	The 2nd Symposium of the Canadian Society for Virology (CSV2018) was held in June 2018 in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, as a featured event marking the 200th anniversary of Dalhousie University. CSV2018 attracted 175 attendees from across Canada and around the world, more than double the number that attended the first CSV symposium two years earlier. CSV2018 provided a forum to discuss a wide range of topics in virology including human, veterinary, plant, and microbial pathogens. Invited keynote speakers included David Kelvin (Dalhousie University and Shantou University Medical College) who provided a historical perspective on influenza on the 100th anniversary of the 1918 pandemic; Sylvain Moineau (Université Laval) who described CRISPR-Cas systems and anti-CRISPR proteins in warfare between bacteriophages and their host microbes; and Kate O'Brien (then from Johns Hopkins University, now relocated to the World Health Organization where she is Director of Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals), who discussed the underlying viral etiology for pneumonia in the developing world, and the evidence for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) as a primary cause. Reflecting a strong commitment of Canadian virologists to science communication, CSV2018 featured the launch of Halifax's first annual Soapbox Science event to enable public engagement with female scientists, and the live-taping of the 499th episode of the This Week in Virology (TWIV) podcast, hosted by Vincent Racaniello (Columbia University) and science writer Alan Dove. TWIV featured interviews of CSV co-founders Nathalie Grandvaux (Université de Montréal) and Craig McCormick (Dalhousie University), who discussed the origins and objectives of the new society; Ryan Noyce (University of Alberta), who discussed technical and ethical considerations of synthetic virology; and Kate O'Brien, who discussed vaccines and global health. Finally, because CSV seeks to provide a better future for the next generation of Canadian virologists, the symposium featured a large number of oral and poster presentations from trainees and closed with the awarding of presentation prizes to trainees, followed by a tour of the Halifax Citadel National Historic Site and an evening of entertainment at the historic Alexander Keith's Brewery.

30668910	The CRISPR-Cas9 nuclease has been repurposed as a tool for gene repression (CRISPRi). This catalytically dead Cas9 (dCas9) variant inhibits transcription by blocking either initiation or elongation by the RNA polymerase complex. Conditional control of dCas9-mediated repression has been achieved with inducible promoters that regulate the expression of the dcas9 gene. However, as dCas9-mediated gene silencing is very efficient, even slightly leaky dcas9 expression leads to significant background levels of repression of the target gene. In this study, we report on the development of optimized control of dCas9-mediated silencing through additional regulation at the translation level. We have introduced the TAG stop codon in the dcas9 gene in order to insert a synthetic amino acid, l-biphenylalanine (BipA), at a permissive site in the dCas9 protein. In the absence of BipA, a nonfunctional, truncated dCas9 is produced, but when BipA is present, the TAG codon is translated resulting in a functional, full-length dCas9 protein. This synthetic, BipA-containing dCas9 variant (dCas9-BipA) could still fully repress gene transcription. Comparison of silencing mediated by dCas9 to dCas9-BipA revealed a 14-fold reduction in background repression by the latter system. The here developed proof-of-principle system thus reduces unwanted background levels of gene silencing, allowing for tight and timed control of target gene expression.

30666960	CRISPR-based homing gene drives have sparked both enthusiasm and deep concerns due to their potential for genetically altering entire species. This raises the question about our ability to prevent the unintended spread of such drives from the laboratory into a natural population. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the suitability of synthetic target site drives as well as split drives as flexible safeguarding strategies for gene drive experiments by showing that their performance closely resembles that of standard homing drives in Drosophila melanogaster. Using our split drive system, we further find that maternal deposition of both Cas9 and gRNA is required to form resistance alleles in the early embryo and that maternally-deposited Cas9 alone can power germline drive conversion in individuals that lack a genomic source of Cas9.

30659195	Hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) exhibit distinct promoter hypermethylation patterns, but the epigenetic regulation and function of transcriptional enhancers remain unclear. Here, our affinity- and bisulfite-based whole-genome sequencing analyses reveal global enhancer hypomethylation in human HCCs. Integrative epigenomic characterization further pinpoints a recurrent hypomethylated enhancer of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-beta (C/EBPβ) which correlates with C/EBPβ over-expression and poorer prognosis of patients. Demethylation of C/EBPβ enhancer reactivates a self-reinforcing enhancer-target loop via direct transcriptional up-regulation of enhancer RNA. Conversely, deletion of this enhancer via CRISPR/Cas9 reduces C/EBPβ expression and its genome-wide co-occupancy with BRD4 at H3K27ac-marked enhancers and super-enhancers, leading to drastic suppression of driver oncogenes and HCC tumorigenicity. Hepatitis B X protein transgenic mouse model of HCC recapitulates this paradigm, as C/ebpβ enhancer hypomethylation associates with oncogenic activation in early tumorigenesis. These results support a causal link between aberrant enhancer hypomethylation and C/EBPβ over-expression, thereby contributing to hepatocarcinogenesis through global transcriptional reprogramming.

30655525	There are no approved therapies for Ebola virus infection. Here, to find potential therapeutic targets, we perform a screen for genes essential for Ebola virus (EBOV) infection. We identify GNPTAB, which encodes the α and β subunits of N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate transferase. We show that EBOV infection of a GNPTAB knockout cell line is impaired, and that this is reversed by reconstituting GNPTAB expression. Fibroblasts from patients with mucolipidosis II, a disorder associated with mutations in GNPTAB, are refractory to EBOV, whereas cells from their healthy parents support infection. Impaired infection correlates with loss of the expression of cathepsin B, known to be essential for EBOV entry. GNPTAB activity is dependent upon proteolytic cleavage by the SKI-1/S1P protease. Inhibiting this protease with the small-molecule PF-429242 blocks EBOV entry and infection. Disruption of GNPTAB function may represent a strategy for a host-targeted therapy for EBOV.

30655519	Smacoviridae is a family of small (~2.5 Kb) CRESS-DNA (Circular Rep Encoding Single-Stranded (ss) DNA) viruses. These viruses have been found in faeces, were thought to infect eukaryotes and are suspected to cause gastrointestinal disease in humans. CRISPR-Cas systems are adaptive immune systems in prokaryotes, wherein snippets of genomes from invaders are stored as spacers that are interspersed between a repeated CRISPR sequence. Here we report several spacer sequences in the faecal archaeon Candidatus Methanomassiliicoccus intestinalis matching smacoviruses, implicating the archaeon as a firm candidate for a host. This finding may be relevant to understanding the potential origin of smacovirus-associated human diseases. Our results support that CRESS-DNA viruses can infect non-eukaryotes, which would mean that smacoviruses are the viruses with the smallest genomes to infect prokaryotes known to date. A probable target strand bias suggests that, in addition to double-stranded DNA, the CRISPR-Cas system can target ssDNA.	C Díez-Villaseñor|F Rodriguez-Valera

30654827	Genome engineering methods have advanced greatly with the development of programmable nucleases, but methods for quantifying on- and off-target cleavage sites and associated deletions remain nascent. Here, we report an improvement of the GUIDE-seq method, iGUIDE, which allows filtering of mispriming events to clarify the true cleavage signal. Using iGUIDE, we specify the locations of Cas9-guided cleavage for four guide RNAs, characterize associated deletions, and show that naturally occurring background DNA double-strand breaks are associated with open chromatin, gene dense regions, and chromosomal fragile sites. iGUIDE is available from https://github.com/cnobles/iGUIDE .

30652290	The advanced biotechnology CRISPR/Cas9 as a powerful genome editing tool has displayed great potential for improving important agronomic traits such as yield and quality. It has gained momentum worldwide for gene function research of plants in recent years. As for cereals, numerous studies of CRISPR/Cas9 have been reported predominately on rice and quite a few on other cereals including maize, wheat, and barley. In contrast, there are only a couple of reports on sorghum up to date. In this chapter, the CRISPR/Cas9 system has been investigated for sorghum genome editing through biolistic bombardment. Two target genes, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) and phytoene desaturase (PDS), have been investigated by CRISPR/Cas9 though bomboarment. Successful genome editing has been achieved within the sorghum genotype Tx430. Furthermore, sequencing PCR product of transgenic plants has confirmed that the CRISPR/Cas9 successfully edited the target gene in sorghum. Both homozygosis and heterozygosis editings of CAD gene have been confirmed in T0 primary transgenic lines through sequencing PCR products. T1 generation of CRISPR plants has been investigated as well. The results illustrated that the edited gene has passed down to next generation. More experiments, such as optimizing promoters for guide RNA (gRNA) and Cas9 in sorghum, are under investigation. Three factors were considered crucial elements to establish an efficient CRISPR/Cas9 system for genome editing in sorghum: (1) an efficient transformation system, (2) the design of targeted gene sequence for gRNA, (3) effective expression of CRISPR components including Cas9 and gRNA.

30652289	The application of CRISPR/Cas to introduce targeted genomic edits is powering research and discovery across the genetic frontier. Applying CRISPR/Cas in sorghum can facilitate the study of gene function and unlock our understanding of this robust crop that serves as a staple for some of the most food insecure regions on the planet. When paired with recent advances in sorghum tissue culture and Agrobacteria technology, CRISPR/Cas can be used to introduce desirable changes and natural genetic variations directly into agriculturally relevant sorghum lines facilitating product development. This chapter describes CRISPR/Cas gene editing and provides high-level strategies and expectations for applying this technology using Agrobacterium in sorghum.	JD Sander
30651362	Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is the etiologic agent of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), an AIDS-defining cancer in HIV-1-infected individuals or immune-suppressed transplant patients. The prevalence for both KSHV and KS are highest in sub-Saharan Africa where HIV-1 infection is also epidemic. There is no effective treatment for advanced KS; therefore, the survival rate is low. Similar to other herpesviruses, KSHV's ability to establish latent infection in the host presents a major challenge to KS treatment or prevention. Strategies to reduce KSHV episomal persistence in latently infected cells might lead to approaches to prevent KS development. The CRISPR-Cas9 system is a gene editing technique that has been used to specifically manipulate the HIV-1 genome but also Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) which, similar to KSHV, belongs to the Gammaherpesvirus family. Among KSHV gene products, the latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) is absolutely required in the maintenance, replication, and segregation of KSHV episomes during mitosis, which makes LANA an ideal target for CRISPR-Cas9 editing. In this study, we designed a replication-incompetent adenovirus type 5 to deliver a LANA-specific Cas9 system (Ad-CC9-LANA) into various KSHV latent target cells. We showed that KSHV latently infected epithelial and endothelial cells transduced with Ad-CC9-LANA underwent significant reductions in the KSHV episome burden, LANA RNA and protein expression over time, but this effect is less profound in BC3 cells due to the low infection efficiency of adenovirus type 5 for B cells. The use of an adenovirus vector might confer potential in vivo applications of LANA-specific Cas9 against KSHV infection and KS.IMPORTANCE The ability for Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), the causative agent of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), to establish and maintain latency has been a major challenge to clearing infection and preventing KS development. This is the first study to demonstrate the feasibility of using a KSHV LANA-targeted CRISPR-Cas9 and adenoviral delivery system to disrupt KSHV latency in infected epithelial and endothelial cell lines. Our system significantly reduced the KSHV episomal burden over time. Given the safety record of adenovirus as vaccine or delivery vectors, this approach to limit KSHV latency may also represent a viable strategy against other tumorigenic viruses and may have potential benefits in developing countries where the viral cancer burden is high.

30645648	The establishment of HIV-1 latency gives rise to persistent chronic infection that requires life-long treatment. To reverse latency for viral eradiation, the HIV-1 Tat protein and its associated ELL2-containing Super Elongation Complexes (ELL2-SECs) are essential to activate HIV-1 transcription. Despite efforts to identify effective latency-reversing agents (LRA), avenues for exposing latent HIV-1 remain inadequate, prompting the need to identify novel LRA targets. Here, by conducting a CRISPR interference-based screen to reiteratively enrich loss-of-function genotypes that increase HIV-1 transcription in latently infected CD4+ T cells, we have discovered a key role of the proteasome in maintaining viral latency. Downregulating or inhibiting the proteasome promotes Tat-transactivation in cell line models. Furthermore, the FDA-approved proteasome inhibitors bortezomib and carfilzomib strongly synergize with existing LRAs to reactivate HIV-1 in CD4+ T cells from antiretroviral therapy-suppressed individuals without inducing cell activation or proliferation. Mechanistically, downregulating/inhibiting the proteasome elevates the levels of ELL2 and ELL2-SECs to enable Tat-transactivation, indicating the proteasome-ELL2 axis as a key regulator of HIV-1 latency and promising target for therapeutic intervention.

30643127	Repurposed CRISPR-Cas molecules provide a useful tool set for broad applications of genomic editing and regulation of gene expression in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Recent discovery of phage-derived proteins, anti-CRISPRs, which serve to abrogate natural CRISPR anti-phage activity, potentially expands the ability to build synthetic CRISPR-mediated circuits. Here, we characterize a panel of anti-CRISPR molecules for expanded applications to counteract CRISPR-mediated gene activation and repression of reporter and endogenous genes in various cell types. We demonstrate that cells pre-engineered with anti-CRISPR molecules become resistant to gene editing, thus providing a means to generate "write-protected" cells that prevent future gene editing. We further show that anti-CRISPRs can be used to control CRISPR-based gene regulation circuits, including implementation of a pulse generator circuit in mammalian cells. Our work suggests that anti-CRISPR proteins should serve as widely applicable tools for synthetic systems regulating the behavior of eukaryotic cells.

30642460	Geopolitical and economic factors have motivated the scientific community to utilize renewable energy resources. In addition to the modifications in major steps and processes of biofuel production, manipulation of microbial genome engineering tools is essential in order to find sustainable solution of continuous depletion of fossil-fuels. Recently, the CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat)/Cas9 (CRISPR-associated nuclease 9), a prokaryotic molecular immunity system, has emerged as a novel technology for targeted genomic engineering. This genetic machinery seems to be a groundbreaking discovery to engineer the microbial genomes for desired traits such as enhancing the biofuel tolerance, inhibitor tolerance and thermotolerance as well as modifying the cellulases and hemicelluloses enzymes. In this review, a summary of different generations of biofuels, integrated processes of bioconversion of raw materials into biofuels and role of microbes in biofuel production has been presented. However, the ultimate focus of the review is on major discoveries of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing in microorganisms and exploitation of these discoveries for enhanced biofuel production.

30641114	Depression or stress is reportedly related to the overflow of inflammatory factors in the body and T cells were reported to play important roles in balancing the release of inflammatory factors through vagus nerve circuit. However, few works have been conducted to find if natural killer (NK) cells can also exert the similar function in the reported vagus nerve circuit as T cells and if there was any relationship between depression and this function. In the present study, the behavioral tests on BALB/c mice indicated that the depressant-like symptoms could be improved and simultaneously the concentrations of inflammatory factors in peripheral blood could be reduced significantly by adoptively transferring NK cells into stressed BALB/c mice. The results revealed that NK cells could control the release of inflammatory factors secreted by macrophages and β2-AR (β2-adrenergic receptor) on the NK cells were of great importance. Behavioral tests on NCG mice indicated that the antidepressant-like effects of NK cells notably declined after adoptively transferring NK cells with β2-AR deficiency or with ChAT (choline acetyltransferase) deficiency into stressed NCG mice. Simultaneously, the anti-inflammatory effects also declined significantly both in vivo and in vitro, which indicated that the antidepressant-like property of NK cells may be related to its ability of controlling the release of inflammatory factors. Taken together, we find that NK cells may balance the release of inflammatory factors in our body by transporting the information between the terminal vagal branches and macrophages, which is the mechanism that NK cells may exert antidepressant-like effects.

30640901	Trypanosoma cruzi has three distinct life cycle stages; epimastigote, trypomastigote, and amastigote. Amastigote is the replication stage in host mammalian cells, hence this stage of parasite has clinical significance in drug development research. Presence of extracellular amastigotes (EA) and their infection capability have been known for some decades. Here, we demonstrate that EA can be utilized as an axenic culture to aid in stage-specific study of T. cruzi. Amastigote-like property of axenic amastigote can be sustained in LIT medium at 37°C at least for 1 week, judging from their morphology, amastigote-specific UTR-regulated GFP expression, and stage-specific expression of selected endogenous genes. Inhibitory effect of benznidazole and nifurtimox on axenic amastigotes was comparable to that on intracellular amastigotes. Exogenous nucleic acids can be transfected into EA via conventional electroporation, and selective marker could be utilized for enrichment of transfectants. We also demonstrate that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene knockout can be performed in EA. Essentiality of the target gene can be evaluated by the growth capability of the knockout EA, either by continuation of axenic culturing or by host infection and following replication as intracellular amastigotes. By taking advantage of the accessibility and sturdiness of EA, we can potentially expand our experimental freedom in studying amastigote stage of T. cruzi.	Y Takagi|Y Akutsu|M Doi|K Furukawa
30640520	The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9 technology facilitates somatic genome editing to reveal cooperative genetic interactions at the cellular level without extensive breeding between different mutant animals. Here we propose a transgenic inducible Cas9 effector-CRISPR mutagen (ICE CRIM) mouse model in which CRISPR/Cas9-mediated somatic mutagenesis events can occur in response to Cre expression. The well-known tumor suppressor gene, Trp53, and 2 important DNA mismatch repair genes, Mlh1 and Msh2, were selected to be our somatic mutagenesis targets. Amplicon-based sequencing was performed to validate the editing efficiency and to identify the mutant allelic series. Crossed with various Cre lines, the Trp53 ICE CRIM alleles were activated to generate targeted cancer gene somatic or germ line mutant variants. We provide experimental evidence to show that an activated ICE CRIM can mutate both targeted alleles within a cell. Simultaneous disruption of multiple genes was also achieved when there were multiple single-guide RNA expression cassettes embedded within an activated ICE CRIM. Our mouse model can be used to generate mutant pools in vivo, which enables a functional screen to be performed in situ. Our results also provide evidence to support a monoclonal origin of hematopoietic neoplasms and to indicate that DNA mismatch repair deficiency accelerates tumorigenesis in Trp53 mutant genetic background.-Fan, H.-H., Yu, I.-S., Lin, Y.-H., Wang, S.-Y., Liaw, Y.-H., Chen, P.-L., Yang, T.-L., Lin, S.-W., Chen, Y.-T.

30639408	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) loci and CRISPR-associated (Cas) genes encode CRISPR RNAs (crRNA) and Cas proteins, respectively, which play important roles in the adaptive immunity system (CRISPR-Cas system) in prokaryotes. The crRNA and Cas proteins form ribonucleoprotein effector complexes to capture and degrade invading genetic materials with base complementarity to the crRNA guide sequences. The Csm complex, a type III-A effector complex, comprises five Cas proteins (Csm1-Csm5) and a crRNA, which co-transcriptionally degrades invading DNA and RNA. Here we report the crystal structures of the Staphylococcus epidermidis Csm2 (SeCsm2) and Thermoplasma volcanium Csm3 (TvCsm3) at 2.4- and 2.7-Å resolutions, respectively. SeCsm2 adopts a monomeric globular fold by itself, in striking contrast to the previously reported Thermotoga maritima Csm2, which adopted an extended conformation and formed a dimeric structure. We propose that the globular monomeric form is the bona fide structure of Csm2. TvCsm3 forms a filamentous structure in the crystals. The molecular arrangement of TvCsm3 is similar to that of the stacked Cmr4 proteins in the Cmr complex, suggesting the functionally relevant architecture of the present Csm3 structure. We constructed model structures of the Csm complex, which revealed that Csm3 binds the crRNA and periodically deforms the crRNA-target duplex by a similar mechanism to that of Cmr4 in the Cmr complex. The model and mutational analysis suggest that the conserved lysine residue of Csm2 is important for target RNA binding, and Csm2 stabilizes the active structure of the Csm complex to facilitate the reaction.

30639098	T helper type 2 (Th2) cells are important regulators of mammalian adaptive immunity and have relevance for infection, autoimmunity, and tumor immunology. Using a newly developed, genome-wide retroviral CRISPR knockout (KO) library, combined with RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and ChIP-seq, we have dissected the regulatory circuitry governing activation and differentiation of these cells. Our experiments distinguish cell activation versus differentiation in a quantitative framework. We demonstrate that these two processes are tightly coupled and are jointly controlled by many transcription factors, metabolic genes, and cytokine/receptor pairs. There are only a small number of genes regulating differentiation without any role in activation. By combining biochemical and genetic data, we provide an atlas for Th2 differentiation, validating known regulators and identifying factors, such as Pparg and Bhlhe40, as part of the core regulatory network governing Th2 helper cell fates.

30636320	To build complex genetic networks with predictable behaviors, synthetic biologists use libraries of modular parts that can be characterized in isolation and assembled together to create programmable higher-order functions. Characterization experiments and computational models for gene regulatory parts operating in isolation are routinely used to predict the dynamics of interconnected parts and guide the construction of new synthetic devices. Here, we individually characterize two modes of RNA-based transcriptional regulation, using small transcription activating RNAs (STARs) and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats interference (CRISPRi), and show how their distinct regulatory timescales can be used to engineer a composed feedforward loop that creates a pulse of gene expression. We use a cell-free transcription-translation system (TXTL) to rapidly characterize the system, and we apply Bayesian inference to extract kinetic parameters for an ordinary differential equation-based mechanistic model. We then demonstrate in simulation and verify with TXTL experiments that the simultaneous regulation of a single gene target with STARs and CRISPRi leads to a pulse of gene expression. Our results suggest the modularity of the two regulators in an integrated genetic circuit, and we anticipate that construction and modeling frameworks that can leverage this modularity will become increasingly important as synthetic circuits increase in complexity.

30635671	Clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas (CRISPR-associated) structures, known as prokaryotes 'immune system', have been successfully applied for genetic engineering and genotyping purposes for a variety of microorganisms. Here we investigated 50 Lactobacillus (L.) sakei genomes and found 13 of them as CRISPR-Cas positive. The majority of positive genomes contain type II-A system, which appears to be widespread across food born lactic acid bacteria. However, a type II-C system with low similarity in Cas protein sequence to related II-C structures is rarely present in the genomes. We depicted a correlation between prophages integrated in the genomes and the presence/absence of CRISPR-Cas systems and identified the novel protospacer adjunction motifs (PAMs) (a/g)AAA for the II-A and (g/a)(c/t)AC for the II-C system including the corresponding tracrRNAs, creating the basis for the development of new Cas-mediated genome editing tools. Moreover, we performed a PCR screening for 81 selected L. sakei isolates and identified 25 (31%) isolates as CRISPR-Cas positive with hypervariable spacer content. Comparative sequence analysis of 33 repeat-spacer arrays resulted in 18 CRISPR genotypes, revealing insights into evolutionary relationships between different strains and illustrating possible applications for the research and development of starter cultures, e.g., the usage for strain differentiation in assertiveness experiments or the development of bacteriophage-resistant strains.

30633952	The histone demethylase KDM6B, also known as jumonji domain-containing protein 3 (JMJD3), is an epigenetic regulator which plays important roles in immune activation, tissue regeneration, cellular senescence and cancer metastasis. But, the role of KDM6B in glioma metastasis is poorly understood. In this study, we achieved transcriptional regulation of KDM6B in glioma cells using CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) and CRISPR activation (CRISPRa). Our results showed that KDM6B promotes the proliferation, migration and invasion of human glioblastoma cells U87 and U251 using CCK8, scratch and transwell assays. Further results indicated that KDM6B increases the expression of SNAI1, a key factor of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). KDM6B catalyzes the demethylation of histone H3 Lys 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) in the promoter of SNAI1, which is important for SNAI1 upregulation. Taken together, these findings provide new insight into the mechanism by which KDM6B promotes glioma metastasis.	A Sui|Y Xu|J Yang|B Pan|J Wu|T Guo|Y Shen|X Guo
30633905	The ability to engineer natural proteins is pivotal to a future, pragmatic biology. CRISPR proteins have revolutionized genome modification, yet the CRISPR-Cas9 scaffold is not ideal for fusions or activation by cellular triggers. Here, we show that a topological rearrangement of Cas9 using circular permutation provides an advanced platform for RNA-guided genome modification and protection. Through systematic interrogation, we find that protein termini can be positioned adjacent to bound DNA, offering a straightforward mechanism for strategically fusing functional domains. Additionally, circular permutation enabled protease-sensing Cas9s (ProCas9s), a unique class of single-molecule effectors possessing programmable inputs and outputs. ProCas9s can sense a wide range of proteases, and we demonstrate that ProCas9 can orchestrate a cellular response to pathogen-associated protease activity. Together, these results provide a toolkit of safer and more efficient genome-modifying enzymes and molecular recorders for the advancement of precision genome engineering in research, agriculture, and biomedicine.

30625138	Today's beer market is challenged by a decreasing consumption of traditional beer styles and an increasing consumption of specialty beers. In particular, lager-type beers (pilsner), characterized by their refreshing and unique aroma and taste, yet very uniform, struggle with their sales. The development of novel variants of the common lager yeast, the interspecific hybrid Saccharomyces pastorianus, has been proposed as a possible solution to address the need of product diversification in lager beers. Previous efforts to generate new lager yeasts through hybridization of the ancestral parental species (S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus) yielded strains with an aromatic profile distinct from the natural biodiversity. Unfortunately, next to the desired properties, these novel yeasts also inherited unwanted characteristics. Most notably is their phenolic off-flavor (POF) production, which hampers their direct application in the industrial production processes. Here, we describe a CRISPR-based gene editing strategy that allows the systematic and meticulous introduction of a natural occurring mutation in the FDC1 gene of genetically complex industrial S. cerevisiae strains, S. eubayanus yeasts and interspecific hybrids. The resulting cisgenic POF- variants show great potential for industrial application and diversifying the current lager beer portfolio.

30624971	Cilia are conserved microtubule-based organelles that function as mechanical and chemical sensors in various cell types. By bioinformatic, genomic, and proteomic studies, more than 2000 proteins have been identified as cilium-associated proteins or putative ciliary proteins; these proteins are referred to as the ciliary proteome or the ciliome. However, little is known about the function of these numerous putative ciliary proteins in cilia. To identify the possible new functional proteins or pathways in cilia, we carried out a small-scale genetic screen targeting 54 putative ciliary genes by using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) system. We successfully constructed 54 zebrafish mutants, and 8 of them displayed microphthalmias. Three of these 8 genes encode proteins for protein transport, suggesting the important roles of protein transport in retinal development. In situ hybridization revealed that all these genes are expressed in zebrafish eyes. Furthermore, polo-like kinase 1 was required for ciliogenesis in neural tube. We uncovered the potential function of the ciliary genes for the retinal development of zebrafish.-Hu, R., Huang, W., Liu, J., Jin, M., Wu, Y., Li, J., Wang, J., Yu, Z., Wang, H., Cao, Y. Mutagenesis of putative ciliary genes with the CRISPR/Cas9 system in zebrafish identifies genes required for retinal development.	R Hu|W Huang|J Liu|M Jin|Y Wu|J Li|J Wang|Z Yu|H Wang|Y Cao
30623723	The inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) produces very high levels of endothelin-1 (ET-1) that acts as an autocrine inhibitor of IMCD Na+ and water reabsorption. Recent studies suggest that IMCD ET-1 production is enhanced by extracellular hypertonicity as can occur during high salt intake. Although NFAT5 has been implicated in the IMCD ET-1 hypertonicity response, no studies in any cell type have identified NFAT5 as a transcriptional regulator of the EDN1 gene; the current study examined this using a mouse IMCD cell line (IMCD3). Media hypertonicity increased IMCD3 ET-1 mRNA in a dose- and time-dependent manner associated with increased NFAT5 nuclear localization. Knockdown of NFAT5 using small-interfering RNA or by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated targeting of exon 4 of the NFAT5 gene reduced the ET-1 hypertonicity response. Chromatin immunoprecipitation using an NFAT5 antibody pulled down ET-1 promoter regions containing NFAT5 consensus binding sequences. Transfected ET-1 promoter reporter constructs revealed maximal hypertonicity-induced reporter activity in the proximal 1-kb region; mutation of the two NFAT5 consensus-binding sites in this region abolished hypertonicity-induced reporter activity. The 1-kb ET-1 promoter-reporter construct lost hypertonicity responsiveness when transfected in CRISPR/Cas9-induced NFAT5-deficient cells. In summary, these findings represent the first description that NFAT5 is a direct transcriptional regulator of the EDN1 gene in IMCD cells and point to a potentially important mechanism by which body Na+ homeostasis is maintained.

30621757	Long intergenic RNAs (lincRNAs) play critical roles in eukaryotic cells, but systematic analyses of the lincRNAs of an animal for phenotypes are lacking. We generate CRISPR knockout strains for Caenorhabditis elegans lincRNAs and evaluate their phenotypes.	C. elegans lincRNAs demonstrate global features such as shorter length and fewer exons than mRNAs. For the systematic evaluation of C. elegans lincRNAs, we produce CRISPR knockout strains for 155 of the total 170 C. elegans lincRNAs. Mutants of 23 lincRNAs show phenotypes in 6 analyzed traits. We investigate these lincRNAs by phenotype for their gene expression patterns and potential functional mechanisms. Some C. elegans lincRNAs play cis roles to modulate the expression of their neighboring genes, and several lincRNAs play trans roles as ceRNAs against microRNAs. We also examine the regulation of lincRNA expression by transcription factors, and we dissect the pathway by which two transcription factors, UNC-30 and UNC-55, together control the expression of linc-73. Furthermore, linc-73 possesses a cis function to modulate the expression of its neighboring kinesin gene unc-104 and thus plays roles in C. elegans locomotion.	By using CRISPR/cas9 technology, we generate knockout strains of 155 C. elegans lincRNAs as valuable resources for studies in noncoding RNAs, and we provide biological insights for 23 lincRNAs with the phenotypes identified in this study.

30620778	The foodborne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes can persist in food-associated environments for long periods. To identify persistent strains, the subtyping method pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) is being replaced by whole genome sequence (WGS)-based subtyping. It was hypothesized that analyzing specific mobile genetic elements, CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Short Repeat) spacer arrays, extracted from WGS data, could differentiate persistent and sporadic isolates within WGS-based clades. To test this hypothesis, 175 L. monocytogenes isolates, previously recovered from retail delis, were analyzed for CRISPR spacers using CRISPRFinder. These isolates represent 23 phylogenetic clades defined by WGS-based single nucleotide polymorphisms and closely related sporadic isolates. In 174/175 (99.4%) of isolates, at least one array with one spacer was identified. Numbers of spacers in a single array ranged from 1 to 28 spacers. Isolates were grouped into 13 spacer patterns (SPs) based on observed variability in the presence or absence of whole spacers. SP variation was consistent with WGS-based clades forming patterns of (i) one SP to one clade, (ii) one SP across many clades, (iii) many SPs within one clade, and (iv) many SPs across many clades. Unfortunately, SPs did not appear to differentiate persistent from sporadic isolates within any WGS-based clade. Overall, these data show that (i) CRISPR arrays are common in WGS data for these food-associated L. monocytogenes and (ii) CRISPR subtyping cannot improve the identification of persistent or sporadic isolates from retail delis. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: CRISPR spacer arrays are present in L. monocytogenes isolates and CRISPR spacer patterns are consistent with previous subtyping methods. These mobile genetic artifacts cannot improve the differentiation between persistent and sporadic L. monocytogenes isolates, used in this study. While CRISPR-based subtyping has been useful for other pathogens, it is not useful in understanding persistence in L. monocytogenes. Thus, the food safety community might be able to use CRISPRs in other areas, but CRISPRs do not seem likely to improve the differentiation of persistence in L. monocytogenes isolates from retail delis.

30616324	A lack of effective drugs and technical means to eradicate hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a bottleneck that limits the ability to fully cure HBV infection. Recently, genome-editing technology based on clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats -associated protein 9 is an emerging technique for editing specific gene loci, which can specifically target HBV covalently closed circular DNA, effectively inhibits HBV DNA replication and regulates HBV functional protein expression, and is expected to become a powerful gene therapy tool for the complete eradication of HBV.

This paper summarizes the latest progress based on the latest research results at home and abroad in the application of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats -associated protein 9 gene editing technology in anti-HBV infection treatment, and expounds its potential and challenges as a radical cure for HBV infection.	缺乏有效根除乙型肝炎病毒（HBV）的药物及技术手段是限制HBV感染无法治愈的瓶颈。成簇的规律间隔短回文重复序列及其相关蛋白9系统是近年来新兴的对特定基因位点进行编辑的技术，可以特异性靶向HBV共价闭合环状DNA，有效抑制HBV DNA复制、调控HBV功能蛋白表达，有望成为彻底根除HBV的强有力基因治疗工具。如何利用成簇的规律间隔短回文重复序列及其相关蛋白9系统实现对HBV基因组高效靶向修饰，从而达到根治HBV感染的目的已经成为当前国内外学者关注的焦点。现结合国内外最新研究成果，重点总结成簇的规律间隔短回文重复序列及其相关蛋白9基因编辑技术在抗HBV感染治疗中应用的最新进展，阐述其作为彻底根治HBV感染方案的潜在可能和挑战。.

30612741	Over one million candidate regulatory elements have been identified across the human genome, but nearly all are unvalidated and their target genes uncertain. Approaches based on human genetics are limited in scope to common variants and in resolution by linkage disequilibrium. We present a multiplex, expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL)-inspired framework for mapping enhancer-gene pairs by introducing random combinations of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated perturbations to each of many cells, followed by single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Across two experiments, we used dCas9-KRAB to perturb 5,920 candidate enhancers with no strong a priori hypothesis as to their target gene(s), measuring effects by profiling 254,974 single-cell transcriptomes. We identified 664 (470 high-confidence) cis enhancer-gene pairs, which were enriched for specific transcription factors, non-housekeeping status, and genomic and 3D conformational proximity to their target genes. This framework will facilitate the large-scale mapping of enhancer-gene regulatory interactions, a critical yet largely uncharted component of the cis-regulatory landscape of the human genome.

30610645	The Target-AID system, consisting of a complex of cytidine deaminase and deficient CRISPR/Cas9, enables highly specific genomic nucleotide substitutions without the need for template DNA. The Cas9-fused cytidine deaminase is guided by sgRNAs and catalyzes the conversion of cytosine to uracil. The resulting U-G DNA mismatches trigger nucleotide substitutions (C to T or G to A) through DNA replication and repair pathways. Target-AID also retains the benefits of conventional CRISPR/Cas9 including robustness in various organisms, high targeting efficiency, and multiplex simultaneous gene editing. Our research group recently developed plant-optimized Target-AID system and demonstrated targeted base editing in tomato and rice. In this chapter, we introduce methods for Target-AID application in tomato.	Z Shimatani|T Ariizumi|U Fujikura|A Kondo|H Ezura|K Nishida
30610634	CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology has successfully introduced modifications at target DNA sequences in many plant species including Arabidopsis. After the target gene is edited, the CRISPR/Cas9 construct needs to be removed to ensure genetic stability and to gain any regulatory approval for commercial applications. However, removal of the transgenes by genetic segregation, backcross, and genotyping is very laborious and time-consuming. The methods we report here allow fast and effective isolation of transgene-free T2 Arabidopsis plants with the desired modifications at the target genes. We express a fluorescence protein mCherry under the control of a seed-specific promoter At2S3 and placed the cassette into the CRISPR/Cas9 vector. Therefore, we can use mCherry as a proxy for the presence of Cas9, and we are able to visually isolate the Cas9-free Arabidopsis plants with heritable mutations at the T2 generation. We targeted two sites in the ABP1 gene to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.	H Yu|Y Zhao
30610630	CRISPR systems have greatly promoted research in genome editing and transcriptional regulation. CRISPR-based transcriptional repression and activation systems will be valuable for applications in engineering plant immunity, boosting metabolic production, and enhancing our knowledge of gene regulatory networks.

Here, we describe our CRISPR-Act2.0 system which is an improved multiplexing transcriptional activation system in plants.	A Malzahn|Y Zhang|Y Qi
30610626	In many diploid organisms, the majority mutations induced by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-mediated genome editing are non- chimeric, including biallelic, homozygous, and heterozygous mutations. Direct Sanger sequencing of the PCR amplicons containing non-homozygous mutations superimposes sequencing chromatograms, displaying overlapping peaks beginning from the mutation sites. In this chapter we describe the degenerate sequence decoding (DSD) strategy and its automatic web-based tool, DSDecodeM, for decoding the Sanger sequencing chromatograms from different types of targeted mutations. DSDecodeM, as a convenient and versatile tool, can considerably facilitate the genotyping work of CRISPR-induced mutants.	X Xie|X Ma|YG Liu
30610625	The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) system provides a technological breakthrough in targeted mutagenesis. However, a significant amount of time and cost is required to screen for the CRISPR/Cas9-induced mutants from a typically large number of initial samples. Here, we describe a cost-effective and sensitive screening technique based on conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR), termed "annealing at critical temperature PCR" (ACT-PCR), for identifying mutants. ACT-PCR requires only a single PCR step followed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The simplicity of ACT-PCR makes it particularly suitable for rapid, large-scale screening of CRISPR/Cas9-induced mutants.	C Wang|K Wang
30609415	Gene therapy using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat plasmids (pCRISPR) reduces mistakes in gene editing and prevents engendering integrational mutagenesis that has been seen in available genome engineering technologies. Developing an ideal and traceable nanocarrier, which can accurately and efficiently transfer this complex into the cytosol and which facilitates the journey towards the nucleus, is a fascinating area of research. Polyethylenimine (PEI) functionalized carbon dots (CD-PEI) were fabricated by one-step microwave assisted pyrolysis with an average size around 3 nm. This CD-PEI showed good potential for intracellular delivery of genetic materials (∼70%). Also, this CD-PEI with passive surface modification with low molecular PEI (2 kDa) has a very high quantum yield, as high as 40% with low cytotoxicity. The expression rate of the pCRISPR was around 15% in the HEK-293 cell which is comparable with the pristine PEI. Furthermore, the CD-PEI demonstrated good properties, such as high quantum yield, biocompatibility and tunable emission wavelengths, suggesting the potential application of photoluminescent functionalized CDs as a suitable, traceable nanocarrier for CRISPR delivery.

30606466	CRISPR-Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-CRISPR-associated proteins) systems provide prokaryotic cells with adaptive immunity against invading bacteriophages. Bacteriophages counteract bacterial responses by encoding anti-CRISPR inhibitor proteins (Acr). However, the structural basis for their inhibitory actions remains largely unknown. Here, we report the crystal structure of the AcrIIA2-SpyCas9-sgRNA (single-guide RNA) complex at 3.3 Å resolution. We show that AcrIIA2 binds SpyCas9 at a position similar to the target DNA binding region. More specifically, AcrIIA2 interacts with the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) recognition residues of Cas9, preventing target double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) detection. Thus, phage-encoded AcrIIA2 appears to act as a DNA mimic that blocks subsequent dsDNA binding by virtue of its highly acidic residues, disabling bacterial Cas9 by competing with target dsDNA binding with a binding motif distinct from AcrIIA4. Our study provides a more detailed mechanistic understanding of AcrIIA2-mediated inhibition of SpyCas9, the most widely used genome-editing tool, opening new avenues for improved regulatory precision during genome editing.

30604007	The D2 dopamine receptor (Drd2) is implicated in several brain disorders such as schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, and drug addiction. Drd2 is also the primary target of both antipsychotics and Parkinson's disease medications. Although the expression pattern of Drd2 is relatively well known in mouse brain, the temporal and spatial distribution of Drd2 is lesser clear in rat brain due to the lack of Drd2 reporter rat lines. Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9 techniques to generate two knockin rat lines: Drd2::Cre and Rosa26::loxp-stop-loxp-tdTomato. By crossing these two lines, we produced Drd2 reporter rats expressing the fluorescence protein tdTomato under the control of the endogenous Drd2 promoter. Using fluorescence imaging and unbiased stereology, we revealed the cellular expression pattern of Drd2 in adult and postnatal rat forebrain. Strikingly, the Drd2 expression pattern differs between Drd2 reporter rats and Drd2 reporter mice generated by BAC transgene in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. These results provide fundamental information needed for the study of Drd2 function in rat forebrain. The Drd2::Cre rats generated here may represent a useful tool to study the function of neuronal populations expressing Drd2.	Q Yu|YZ Liu|YB Zhu|YY Wang|Q Li|DM Yin

30598555	Cas9 is an endonuclease that can be programed to autonomously deliver diverse effectors to specified genetic addresses. High-resolution structures of this protein and its associated CRISPR RNA guide explain the molecular mechanisms of CRISPR-RNA-guided DNA recognition and provide a molecular blueprint that has facilitated structure-guided functional remodeling. Here we retrace events that led from early efforts to understand the central role of Cas9 in CRISPR-mediated adaptive immunity to contemporary efforts aimed at developing and deploying this enzyme for programmable genetic editing.

30595536	Replication-dependent histone genes often reside in tandemly arrayed gene clusters, hindering systematic loss-of-function analyses. Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9 and the attP/attB double-integration system to alter numbers and sequences of histone genes in their original genomic context in Drosophila melanogaster. As few as 8 copies of the histone gene unit supported embryo development and adult viability, whereas flies with 20 copies were indistinguishable from wild-types. By hierarchical assembly, 40 alanine-substitution mutations (covering all known modified residues in histones H3 and H4) were introduced and characterized. Mutations at multiple residues compromised viability, fertility, and DNA-damage responses. In particular, H4K16 was necessary for expression of male X-linked genes, male viability, and maintenance of ovarian germline stem cells, whereas H3K27 was essential for late embryogenesis. Simplified mosaic analysis showed that H3R26 is required for H3K27 trimethylation. We have developed a powerful strategy and valuable reagents to systematically probe histone functions in D. melanogaster.

30594530	Oxidative stress plays an important role in drug-induced toxicity. Oxidative stress-mediated toxicities can be detected using conventional animal models but their sensitivity is insufficient, and novel models to improve susceptibility to oxidative stress have been researched. In recent years, gene targeting methods in zebrafish have been developed, making it possible to generate homozygous null mutants. In this study, we established zebrafish deficient in the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2a (nrf2a), a key antioxidant-responsive gene, and its potential to detect oxidative stress-mediated toxicity was examined.	Nrf2a-deficient zebrafish were generated using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated 9 technique. The loss of nrf2a function was confirmed by the tolerability to hydrogen peroxide and hydrogen peroxide-induced gene expression profiles being related to antioxidant response element (ARE)-dependent signaling. Subsequently, vulnerability of nrf2a-deficient zebrafish to acetaminophen (APAP)- or doxorubicin (DOX)-induced toxicity was investigated.	Nrf2a-deficient zebrafish showed higher mortality than wild type accompanied by less induction of ARE-dependent genes with hydrogen peroxide treatment. Subsequently, this model showed increased severity and incidence of APAP-induced hepatotoxicity or DOX-induced cardiotoxicity than wild type.	Our results demonstrated that anti-oxidative response might not fully function in this model, and resulted in higher sensitivity to drug-induced oxidative stress. Our data support the usefulness of nrf2a-deficient model as a tool for evaluation of oxidative stress-related toxicity in drug discovery research.

30588718	The emergence of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9 technology has dramatically advanced how we manipulate the genome. Regarding in vivo experiments, Cas9-transgenic animals could provide efficient and complex genome editing. However, this potential has not been fully realized partly due to a lack of convenient platforms and limited examples of successful disease modeling. Here, we devised two doxycycline (Dox)-inducible Cas9 platforms that efficiently enable conditional genome editing at multiple loci in vitro and in vivo. In these platforms, we took advantage of a site-specific multi-segment cloning strategy for rapid and easy integration of multiple single guide (sg)RNAs. We found that a platform containing rtTA at the Rosa26 locus and TRE-Cas9 together with multiple sgRNAs at the Col1a1 locus showed higher efficiency of inducible insertions and deletions (indels) with minimal leaky editing. Using this platform, we succeeded to model Wilms' tumor and the progression of intestinal adenomas with multiple mutations including an activating mutation with a large genomic deletion. Collectively, the established platform should make complicated disease modeling in the mouse easily attainable, extending the range of in vivo experiments in various biological fields including cancer research.

30587106	As a result of its simplicity and high efficiency, the CRISPR-Cas system has been widely used as a genome editing tool. Recently, CRISPR base editors, which consist of deactivated Cas9 (dCas9) or Cas9 nickase (nCas9) linked with a cytidine or a guanine deaminase, have been developed. Base editing tools will be very useful for gene correction because they can produce highly specific DNA substitutions without the introduction of any donor DNA, but dedicated web-based tools to facilitate the use of such tools have not yet been developed.	We present two web tools for base editors, named BE-Designer and BE-Analyzer. BE-Designer provides all possible base editor target sequences in a given input DNA sequence with useful information including potential off-target sites. BE-Analyzer, a tool for assessing base editing outcomes from next generation sequencing (NGS) data, provides information about mutations in a table and interactive graphs. Furthermore, because the tool runs client-side, large amounts of targeted deep sequencing data (< 1 GB) do not need to be uploaded to a server, substantially reducing running time and increasing data security. BE-Designer and BE-Analyzer can be freely accessed at http://www.rgenome.net/be-designer/ and http://www.rgenome.net/be-analyzer /, respectively.	We develop two useful web tools to design target sequence (BE-Designer) and to analyze NGS data from experimental results (BE-Analyzer) for CRISPR base editors.

30585775	Gene editing using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) is widely used throughout the zebrafish community for the generation of knockouts and knockins. One of the bottlenecks that exists during the process is the laborious screening of injected embryos for F0 founder fish or CRISPants, weeks after the injection date. In this study we show that the use of fluorescently tagged tracrRNA and sorting for fluorescent embryos as early as the 512-cell stage using stereomicroscope significantly improve yield of fish with successfully CRISPR/Cas9-edited genomes. This is a cost-effective strategy that significantly improves workflow and efficacy in genome editing in particular for less experienced researchers.	M Hamimi|M Khabooshan|HA Castillo|J Kaslin

30583622	To construct CRISPR/Cas9 vectors for the editing of SmPAL1 in the phenylpropane metabolic pathway of Salvia miltiorrhiza, CIRSPR/Cas9 target sites of SmPAL1 were designed by online software. Its target efficiencies were detected in vitro by enzyme digestion and sequences with highly efficiency were constructed into CRISPR/Cas9 vectors. Three possible CRISPR target sequences (SmPAL1-g1, SmPAL1-g2, SmPAL1-g3) were designed and the enzyme digestion efficiencies were 53.3%, 76.6% and 10.0%. SmPAL1-g1 and SmPAL1-g2 were constructed into vector VK005-03 named as VK005-03-g1 and VK005-03-g2. The results of sequencing showed that the two CRISPR/Cas target sequences were all constructed into VK005-03. Here we first laid the foundation for the study of SmPAL1 and provided an effective strategy for the screening of sgRNA.	JR Qiu|YK Su|ZQ Song|XS Fang|JY Li|J Zhang|JH Wang
30583511	The genus Herbaspirillum includes several strains isolated from different grasses. The identification of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in the genus Herbaspirillum is an important stage studying the interaction of these molecules and the way they modulate physiological responses of different mechanisms, through RNA⁻RNA interaction or RNA⁻protein interaction. This interaction with their target occurs through the perfect pairing of short sequences (cis-encoded ncRNAs) or by the partial pairing of short sequences (trans-encoded ncRNAs). However, the companion Hfq can stabilize interactions in the trans-acting class. In addition, there are Riboswitches, located at the 5' end of mRNA and less often at the 3' end, which respond to environmental signals, high temperatures, or small binder molecules. Recently, CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats), in prokaryotes, have been described that consist of serial repeats of base sequences (spacer DNA) resulting from a previous exposure to exogenous plasmids or bacteriophages. We identified 285 ncRNAs in Herbaspirillum seropedicae (H. seropedicae) SmR1, expressed in different experimental conditions of RNA-seq material, classified as cis-encoded ncRNAs or trans-encoded ncRNAs and detected RNA riboswitch domains and CRISPR sequences. The results provide a better understanding of the participation of this type of RNA in the regulation of the metabolism of bacteria of the genus Herbaspirillum spp.	A Carvalho Garcia|VLP Dos Santos|TC Santos Cavalcanti|LM Collaço|H Graf
30582653	CRISPR-Cas9 and Cas12a are two powerful genome editing systems. Expression of CRISPR in plants is typically achieved with a mixed dual promoter system, in which Cas protein is expressed by a Pol II promoter and a guide RNA is expressed by a species-specific Pol III promoter such as U6 or U3. To achieve coordinated expression and compact vector packaging, it is desirable to express both CRISPR components under a single Pol II promoter. Previously, we demonstrated a first-generation single transcript unit (STU)-Cas9 system, STU-Cas9-RZ, which is based on hammerhead ribozyme for processing single guide RNAs (sgRNAs). In this study, we developed two new STU-Cas9 systems and one STU-Cas12a system for applications in plants, collectively called the STU CRISPR 2.0 systems. We demonstrated these systems for genome editing in rice with both transient expression and stable transgenesis. The two STU-Cas9 2.0 systems process the sgRNAs with Csy4 ribonuclease and endogenous tRNA processing system respectively. Both STU-Cas9-Csy4 and STU-Cas9-tRNA systems showed more robust genome editing efficiencies than our first-generation STU-Cas9-RZ system and the conventional mixed dual promoter system. We further applied the STU-Cas9-tRNA system to compare two C to T base editing systems based on rAPOBEC1 and PmCDA1 cytidine deaminases. The results suggest STU-based PmCDA1 base editor system is highly efficient in rice. The STU-Cas12a system, based on Cas12a' self-processing of a CRISPR RNA (crRNA) array, was also developed and demonstrated for expression of a single crRNA and four crRNAs. Altogether, our STU CRISPR 2.0 systems further expanded the CRISPR toolbox for plant genome editing and other applications.

30582405	Characterizing the functions of essential cell cycle control genes requires tight and rapid inducible gene inactivation. Drawbacks of current conditional depletion approaches include slow responses and incomplete depletion. We demonstrated that by integrating the tetracycline-controlled promoter system and the auxin-inducible degron (AID) system together, AID-tagged proteins can be downregulated more efficiently than the individual technology alone. When used in conjunction with CRISPR-Cas9-mediated disruption of the endogenous locus, this system facilitates the analysis of essential genes by allowing rapid and tight conditional depletion, as we have demonstrated using several cell cycle-regulatory genes including cyclin A, CDK2, and TRIP13. The vectors constructed in this study allow expression of AID-fusion proteins under the control of tetracycline-controlled promoters and should be useful in studies requiring rapid and tight suppression of gene expression in mammalian cells.

30581144	CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing has transformed biotechnology and therapeutics. However, in vivo applications of some Cas9s are hindered by large size (limiting delivery by adeno-associated virus [AAV] vectors), off-target editing, or complex protospacer-adjacent motifs (PAMs) that restrict the density of recognition sequences in target DNA. Here, we exploited natural variation in the PAM-interacting domains (PIDs) of closely related Cas9s to identify a compact ortholog from Neisseria meningitidis-Nme2Cas9-that recognizes a simple dinucleotide PAM (N4CC) that provides for high target site density. All-in-one AAV delivery of Nme2Cas9 with a guide RNA targeting Pcsk9 in adult mouse liver produces efficient genome editing and reduced serum cholesterol with exceptionally high specificity. We further expand our single-AAV platform to pre-implanted zygotes for streamlined generation of genome-edited mice. Nme2Cas9 combines all-in-one AAV compatibility, exceptional editing accuracy within cells, and high target site density for in vivo genome editing applications.

30581143	The ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) maintains the integrity of the proteome by selectively degrading misfolded or mis-assembled proteins, but the rules that govern how conformationally defective proteins in the secretory pathway are selected from the structurally and topologically diverse constellation of correctly folded membrane and secretory proteins for efficient degradation by cytosolic proteasomes is not well understood. Here, we combine parallel pooled genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 forward genetic screening with a highly quantitative and sensitive protein turnover assay to discover a previously undescribed collaboration between membrane-embedded cytoplasmic ubiquitin E3 ligases to conjugate heterotypic branched or mixed ubiquitin (Ub) chains on substrates of endoplasmic-reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD). These findings demonstrate that parallel CRISPR analysis can be used to deconvolve highly complex cell biological processes and identify new biochemical pathways in protein quality control.

30580963	Here, we present Perturb-ATAC, a method that combines multiplexed CRISPR interference or knockout with genome-wide chromatin accessibility profiling in single cells based on the simultaneous detection of CRISPR guide RNAs and open chromatin sites by assay of transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (ATAC-seq). We applied Perturb-ATAC to transcription factors (TFs), chromatin-modifying factors, and noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) in ∼4,300 single cells, encompassing more than 63 genotype-phenotype relationships. Perturb-ATAC in human B lymphocytes uncovered regulators of chromatin accessibility, TF occupancy, and nucleosome positioning and identified a hierarchy of TFs that govern B cell state, variation, and disease-associated cis-regulatory elements. Perturb-ATAC in primary human epidermal cells revealed three sequential modules of cis-elements that specify keratinocyte fate. Combinatorial deletion of all pairs of these TFs uncovered their epistatic relationships and highlighted genomic co-localization as a basis for synergistic interactions. Thus, Perturb-ATAC is a powerful strategy to dissect gene regulatory networks in development and disease.

30573688	Powerful new technologies for perturbing genetic elements have recently expanded the study of genetic interactions in model systems ranging from yeast to human cell lines. However, technical artifacts can confound signal across genetic screens and limit the immense potential of parallel screening approaches. To address this problem, we devised a novel PCA-based method for correcting genome-wide screening data, bolstering the sensitivity and specificity of detection for genetic interactions. Applying this strategy to a set of 436 whole genome CRISPR screens, we report more than 1.5 million pairs of correlated "co-functional" genes that provide finer-scale information about cell compartments, biological pathways, and protein complexes than traditional gene sets. Lastly, we employed a gene community detection approach to implicate core genes for cancer growth and compress signal from functionally related genes in the same community into a single score. This work establishes new algorithms for probing cancer cell networks and motivates the acquisition of further CRISPR screen data across diverse genotypes and cell types to further resolve complex cellular processes.

30572690	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) systems are key immune mechanisms helping prokaryotic species fend off RNA and DNA viruses. CRISPR/Cas9 has broad applications in basic research and biotechnology and has been widely used across eukaryotic species for genome engineering and functional analysis of genes. The recently developed CRISPR/Cas13 systems target RNA rather than DNA and thus offer new potential for transcriptome engineering and combatting RNA viruses. Here, we used CRISPR/LshCas13a to stably engineer Arabidopsis thaliana for interference against the RNA genome of Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV). Our data demonstrate that CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) guiding Cas13a to the sequences encoding helper component proteinase silencing suppressor (HC-Pro) or GFP target 2 (GFP-T2) provide better interference compared to crRNAs targeting other regions of the TuMV RNA genome. This work demonstrates the exciting potential of CRISPR/Cas13 to be used as an antiviral strategy to obstruct RNA viruses, and encourages the search for more robust and effective Cas13 variants or CRISPR systems that can target RNA.

30572386	Objective: To analyze the effect of the identification and evaluation of Escherichia (E.) coli and Shigella, based on the upstream flanking sequences of CRISPR1. Methods: Both CRISPR and cas sequences were obtained through the BLAST with repeating sequences against the publicly complete genome in GenBank that related to E. coli and Shigella. Clustal X was used to perform multi-sequences alignment of the flanking sequences. PCR method was used to amplify the upstream flanking sequences of CRISPR1 in order to appraise the effect of identification and evaluation of upstream flanking sequences on E. coli and Shigella, which were based on the upstream flanking sequences of CRISPR1. Results: The results showed that 73.4% of the strains containing the I-E CRISPR/Cas that belonged to the phylogroups A, B1, D while 8.4% strains carried the I-F CRISPR/Cas. Another 17.2% of the strains owned CRISPR3-4 (non-CRISPR/Cas) only belonged to the phylogroups B2. All the Shigella strains carried I-E CRISPR/Cas. More than 99% of similarity the CRISPR1 upstream-flanking sequences was seen in E. coli (except B2) and Shigella and E. coli (B2). Both sensitivity and specificity were greater than 91% after PCR amplification in the region to identify the E.coli and Shigella. Conclusion: The upstream of CRISPR1 could achieve a preliminary identification effect on E.coli and Shigella.	目的： 探讨基于成簇规律间隔的短回文重复序列（CRISPR）1上游侧翼序列对大肠埃希菌和志贺菌鉴定和评价效果。 方法： 通过BLAST重复序列识别并获得全基因组测序大肠埃希菌和志贺菌的CRISPRs和CRISPR相关基因（CRISPR-associated，cas），并分析其种系；选取CRISPRs上、下游各500 bp侧翼序列，使用Clustal X进行序列比对；采用PCR方法扩增CRISPR1上游侧翼序列，以确定其对大肠埃希菌和志贺菌鉴定和评价效果。 结果： 73.4%（149/203）的大肠埃希菌存在I-E型CRISPR/Cas系统，包含了A、B1、D种系；8.4%（17/203）的大肠埃希菌存在I-F型CRISPR/Cas、17.2%（35/203）的大肠埃希菌不存在CRISPR/Cas，这2种大肠埃希菌均属于B2种系；9株志贺菌均存在I-E型CRISPR/Cas。在大肠埃希菌（B2种系外）、志贺菌CRISPR1上游和大肠埃希菌（B2种系）各存在61 bp侧翼序列，序列一致性为99%，且有种属特异性，PCR扩增此区域鉴定大肠埃希菌和志贺菌的灵敏度和特异度均>91%。 结论： 基于CRISPR1上游序列可用来鉴定大肠埃希菌和志贺菌，且具有很好的效果。.

30566855	Previously, researchers discovered a series of anti-CRISPR proteins that inhibit CRISPR-Cas activity, such as Cas9 and Cpf1 (Cas12a). Herein, we constructed crRNA variants consisting of chemically modified DNA-crRNA and RNA-crRNA duplexes and identified that phosphorothioate (PS)-modified DNA-crRNA duplex completely blocked the function of Cpf1. More important, without prehybridization, these PS-modified DNA oligonucleotides showed the ability to suppress DNA double-strand breaks induced by two Cpf1 orthologs, AsCpf1 and LbCpf1. Time-dependent inhibitory effects were validated in multiple loci of different human cells. Further studies demonstrated that PS-modified DNA oligonucleotides were able to serve as Cpf1 inhibitors in a sequence-independent manner. Mechanistic studies indicate that PS-modified DNA oligonucleotides hinder target DNA binding and recognition by Cpf1. Consequently, these synthetic DNA molecules expand the sources of CRISPR inhibitors, providing a platform to inactivate Cpf1-mediated genome editing.

30566001	Deficiency in polycystin 1 triggers specific changes in energy metabolism. To determine whether defects in other human cystoproteins have similar effects, we studied extracellular acidification and glucose metabolism in human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) cell lines with polycystic kidney and hepatic disease 1 (PKHD1) and polycystic kidney disease (PKD) 2 (PKD2) truncating defects along multiple sites of truncating mutations found in patients with autosomal recessive and dominant PKDs. While neither the PKHD1 or PKD2 gene mutations nor their position enhanced cell proliferation rate in our cell line models, truncating mutations in these genes progressively increased overall extracellular acidification over time (P < 0.001 for PKHD1 and PKD2 mutations). PKHD1 mutations increased nonglycolytic acidification rate (1.19 vs. 1.03, P = 0.002), consistent with an increase in tricarboxylic acid cycle activity or breakdown of intracellular glycogen. In addition, they increased basal and ATP-linked oxygen consumption rates [7.59 vs. 5.42 (P = 0.015) and 4.55 vs. 2.98 (P = 0.004)]. The PKHD1 and PKD2 mutations also altered mitochondrial morphology, resembling the effects of polycystin 1 deficiency. Together, these data suggest that defects in major PKD genes trigger changes in mitochondrial energy metabolism. After validation in in vivo models, these initial observations would indicate potential benefits of targeting energy metabolism in the treatment of PKDs.

30565410	Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel), a very destructive insect pest of many fruits and vegetables, is widespread in many Asian countries. To facilitate control of this pest, it is essential to investigate its genetics and gene function using targeted gene disruption.	Here, we describe successful targeted mutagenesis of the white and transformer genes in B. dorsalis through use of the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) system. Co-injection of the white sgRNA and Cas9 mRNA into B. dorsalis embryos caused eye color change, and the white mutations in the germline were heritable. CRISPR-mediated knockout of the sex determination gene transformer (tra) in B. dorsalis resulted in a male-biased sex ratio and adult flies with abnormal outer and interior reproductive organs. Small indels and substitutions were induced by CRIRPR for both genes.	Our data demonstrate that somatic and germline genome engineering of the pest B. dorsalis can be performed efficiently using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, opening the door to the use of the CRISPR-mediated method for functional annotations of genes in B. dorsalis and for its population control using, for example, such as gene drive. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.

30565250	DOCK8 immunodeficiency syndrome (DIDS) is a progressive combined immunodeficiency that can be distinguished from other combined immunodeficiencies or hyperimmunoglobulinemia E syndromes in featuring (a) profound susceptibility to virus infections of the skin, with associated skin cancers, and (b) severe food allergies. The DOCK8 locus has many repetitive sequence elements that predispose to the generation of large germline deletions as well as recombination-mediated somatic DNA repair. Residual DOCK8 protein contributes to the variable disease phenotype. The severe virus infections of the skin, and probably also VZV-associated vasculopathy, reflect an important function of DOCK8, which is normally required to maintain lymphocyte shape integrity as the cells migrate through dense tissues. Loss of DOCK8 also causes immune deficits through other mechanisms including a milder generalized cell survival defect and skewing of T helper cell subsets. Recent work has uncovered the roles for DOCK8 in dendritic cell responses that can also help explain the virus susceptibility, as well as in regulatory T cells that might help explain autoimmunity in a minority of patients. Fortunately, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation cures the eczema and infection susceptibility of DIDS, but not necessarily the other disease manifestations including food allergies.

30559373	CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing strategies have revolutionized our ability to engineer the human genome for robust functional interrogation of complex biological processes. We have recently adapted this technology for use in primary human CD4+ T cells to create a high-throughput platform for analyzing the role of host factors in HIV infection and pathogenesis. Briefly, CRISPR-Cas9 ribonucleoproteins (crRNPs) are synthesized in vitro and delivered to activated CD4+ T cells by nucleofection. These cells are then assayed for editing efficiency and expanded for use in downstream cellular, genetic, or protein-based assays. This platform supports the rapid, arrayed generation of multiple gene manipulations and is widely adaptable across culture conditions, infection protocols, and downstream applications. Here, we present detailed protocols for crRNP synthesis, primary T-cell culture, 96-well nucleofection, molecular validation, and HIV infection, and discuss additional considerations for guide and screen design, as well as crRNP multiplexing. Taken together, this procedure allows high-throughput identification and mechanistic interrogation of HIV host factors in primary CD4+ T cells by gene knockout, validation, and HIV spreading infection in as little as 2-3 weeks.

We report the metabolic engineering of Corynebacterium glutamicum to produce squalene from glucose. Combinatorial metabolic engineering strategies for precursor rebalancing, redox balancing, and blocking the competing pathway for the isopentenyl diphosphate availabilities were applied by repressing the target genes using the CRISPR interference. The best engineered strain using high-throughput fermentation produced squalene from glucose at 5.4 ± 0.3 mg/g dry cell weight (DCW) and 105.3 ± 3.0 mg/L, which was a 5.2-fold increase over the parental strain. In addition, flask cultivation of C. glutamicum overexpressing the dxs and idi genes with squalene synthase gene and repressing the idsA gene resulted in production of squalene at 5.8 ± 0.4 mg/g DCW and 82.8 ± 6.2 mg/L, which was a 3.4-fold increase over the parental strain.

30556694	The ultimate outcome in genome-editing research stepped into unknown territories last month when two babies were brought into the world with clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) facilitated knockdown of chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5). An immediate outcry by the public and the scientific community followed, which is still ongoing with much apprehensions and criticism of the ethical and scientific aspects of the procedure and its effects on the future of genome editing needed in other stubborn inheritable diseases for which there is no cure at present. With the debate on the consequences of this particular receptor knockdown still going on and the after-shocks in the form of queries expected to continue for some time in the future, we enter the arena of this particular genome editing as first responders with concerns regarding the neurological aftermath of CCR5 knockout in the babies born.

30556600	Despite recent advances in targeted and immune-based therapies, advanced stage melanoma remains a clinical challenge with a poor prognosis. Understanding the genes and cellular processes that drive progression and metastasis is critical for identifying new therapeutic strategies. Here, we found that the GTPase RAB27A was overexpressed in a subset of melanomas, which correlated with poor patient survival. Loss of RAB27A expression in melanoma cell lines inhibited 3D spheroid invasion and cell motility in vitro, and spontaneous metastasis in vivo. The reduced invasion phenotype was rescued by RAB27A-replete exosomes, but not RAB27A-knockdown exosomes, indicating that RAB27A is responsible for the generation of pro-invasive exosomes. Furthermore, while RAB27A loss did not alter the number of exosomes secreted, it did change exosome size and altered the composition and abundance of exosomal proteins, some of which are known to regulate cancer cell movement. Our data suggest that RAB27A promotes the biogenesis of a distinct pro-invasive exosome population. These findings support RAB27A as a key cancer regulator, as well as a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target in melanoma.

30555184	Understanding the conformational dynamics of CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat)-Cas9 is of the utmost importance for improving its genome editing capability. Here, molecular dynamics simulations performed using Anton-2 - a specialized supercomputer capturing micro-to-millisecond biophysical events in real time and at atomic-level resolution - reveal the activation process of the endonuclease Cas9 toward DNA cleavage. Over the unbiased simulation, we observe that the spontaneous approach of the catalytic domain HNH to the DNA cleavage site is accompanied by a remarkable structural remodeling of the recognition (REC) lobe, which exerts a key role for DNA cleavage. Specifically, the significant conformational changes and the collective conformational dynamics of the REC lobe indicate a mechanism by which the REC1-3 regions 'sense' nucleic acids, 'regulate' the HNH conformational transition, and ultimately 'lock' the HNH domain at the cleavage site, contributing to its catalytic competence. By integrating additional independent simulations and existing experimental data, we provide a solid validation of the activated HNH conformation, which had been so far poorly characterized, and we deliver a comprehensive understanding of the role of REC1-3 in the activation process. Considering the importance of the REC lobe in the specificity of Cas9, this study poses the basis for fully understanding how the REC components control the cleavage of off-target sequences, laying the foundation for future engineering efforts toward improved genome editing.

30554945	The CRISPR-Cas9 system has successfully been adapted to edit the genome of various organisms. However, our ability to predict the editing outcome at specific sites is limited. Here, we examined indel profiles at over 1,000 genomic sites in human cells and uncovered general principles guiding CRISPR-mediated DNA editing. We find that precision of DNA editing (i.e., recurrence of a specific indel) varies considerably among sites, with some targets showing one highly preferred indel and others displaying numerous infrequent indels. Editing precision correlates with editing efficiency and a preference for single-nucleotide homologous insertions. Precise targets and editing outcome can be predicted based on simple rules that mainly depend on the fourth nucleotide upstream of the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). Indel profiles are robust, but they can be influenced by chromatin features. Our findings have important implications for clinical applications of CRISPR technology and reveal general patterns of broken end joining that can provide insights into DNA repair mechanisms.

30554640	Various recombinant proteins can be produced by the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell factories; therefore, efficient recombinant protein production techniques are desirable. In this study, to establish an efficient recombinant protein production technique in S. cerevisiae, the secretory production of recombinant protein endoglucanase II (TrEG) was tested. We developed 2 novel methods for TrEG production via clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) -δ-integration as well as multiple promoter shuffling, which involved the pre-breakdown of the δ-sequence by the CRISPR system and subsequent δ-integration as well as the conjugation of TrEG with various promoters and subsequent δ-integration, respectively. Moreover, simultaneous use of the CRISPR-δ-integration and multiple promoter shuffling methods was also examined. The CRISPR-δ-integration method was effective for improvement of the integrated TrEG copy number and its activity, and the multiple promoter shuffling method was also beneficial for enhancing the transcriptional level of TrEG and its activity. Furthermore, simultaneous use of CRISPR-δ-integration and multiple promoter shuffling methods was the most useful. The carboxymethyl cellulase activity of the TrEG expressing transformant YPH499/24CP constructed by the method reached 559 U/L, and it was 17.3-fold higher than that of the transformant constructed by the conventional YEp type vector. Overall, the simultaneous use of CRISPR-δ-integration and multiple promoter shuffling can be useful and easily applied for recombinant protein production.	Y Sasaki|R Mitsui|R Yamada|H Ogino
30552336	Disorders of sex development (DSDs) are conditions affecting development of the gonads or genitalia. Variants in two key genes, SRY and its target SOX9, are an established cause of 46,XY DSD, but the genetic basis of many DSDs remains unknown. SRY-mediated SOX9 upregulation in the early gonad is crucial for testis development, yet the regulatory elements underlying this have not been identified in humans. Here, we identified four DSD patients with overlapping duplications or deletions upstream of SOX9. Bioinformatic analysis identified three putative enhancers for SOX9 that responded to different combinations of testis-specific regulators. All three enhancers showed synergistic activity and together drive SOX9 in the testis. This is the first study to identify SOX9 enhancers that, when duplicated or deleted, result in 46,XX or 46,XY sex reversal, respectively. These enhancers provide a hitherto missing link by which SRY activates SOX9 in humans, and establish SOX9 enhancer mutations as a significant cause of DSD.

30552162	Drug-resistant mycobacteria are a rising problem worldwide. There is an urgent need to understand the immune response to tuberculosis to identify host targets that, if targeted therapeutically, could be used to tackle these currently untreatable infections. In this study we use an Il-1β fluorescent transgenic line to show that there is an early innate immune proinflammatory response to well-established zebrafish models of inflammation and Mycobacterium marinum infection. We demonstrate that host-derived hypoxia signaling, mediated by the Hif-1α transcription factor, can prime macrophages with increased levels of Il-1β in the absence of infection, upregulating neutrophil antimicrobial NO production, leading to greater protection against infection. Our data link Hif-1α to proinflammatory macrophage Il-1β transcription in vivo during early mycobacterial infection and importantly highlight a host protective mechanism, via antimicrobial NO, that decreases disease outcomes and that could be targeted therapeutically to stimulate the innate immune response to better deal with infections.

30552128	Clonal marking techniques based on the Cre/lox and Flp/FRT systems are widely used in multicellular model organisms to mark individual cells and their progeny, in order to study their morphology, growth properties and developmental fates. The same tools can be adapted to introduce specific genetic changes in a subset of cells within the body, i.e. to perform mosaic genetic analysis. Marking and manipulating distinct cell clones requires control over the frequency of clone induction, which is sometimes difficult to achieve. Here, we present Valcyrie, a new method that replaces the conventional Cre or Flp recombinase-mediated excision of a marker cassette by CRISPR-mediated excision. A major advantage of this approach is that CRISPR efficiency can be tuned in a predictable fashion by manipulating the degree of sequence complementarity between the CRISPR guide RNA and its targets. We establish the method in the beetle Tribolium castaneum We demonstrate that clone marking frequency can be tuned to generate embryos that carry single marked clones. The Valcyrie approach can be applied to a wide range of experimental settings, for example to modulate clone frequency with existing tools in established model organisms and to introduce clonal analysis in emerging experimental models.

30551175	Extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) and ring chromosomes are genetic alterations found in humans with genetic disorders. However, there is a lack of genetic engineering tools to recapitulate and study the biogenesis of eccDNAs. Here, we created a dual-fluorescence biosensor cassette, which upon the delivery of pairs of CRISPR/Cas9 guide RNAs, CRISPR-C, allows us to study the biogenesis of a specific fluorophore expressing eccDNA in human cells. We show that CRISPR-C can generate functional eccDNA, using the novel eccDNA biosensor system. We further reveal that CRISPR-C also can generate eccDNAs from intergenic and genic loci in human embryonic kidney 293T cells and human mammary fibroblasts. EccDNAs mainly forms by end-joining mediated DNA-repair and we show that CRISPR-C is able to generate endogenous eccDNAs in sizes from a few hundred base pairs and ranging up to 207 kb. Even a 47.4 megabase-sized ring chromosome 18 can be created by CRISPR-C. Our study creates a new territory for CRISPR gene editing and highlights CRISPR-C as a useful tool for studying the cellular impact, persistence and function of eccDNAs.

30545847	A wide range of human diseases result from haploinsufficiency, where the function of one of the two gene copies is lost. Here, we targeted the remaining functional copy of a haploinsufficient gene using CRISPR-mediated activation (CRISPRa) in Sim1 and Mc4r heterozygous mouse models to rescue their obesity phenotype. Transgenic-based CRISPRa targeting of the Sim1 promoter or its distant hypothalamic enhancer up-regulated its expression from the endogenous functional allele in a tissue-specific manner, rescuing the obesity phenotype in Sim1 heterozygous mice. To evaluate the therapeutic potential of CRISPRa, we injected CRISPRa-recombinant adeno-associated virus into the hypothalamus, which led to reversal of the obesity phenotype in Sim1 and Mc4r haploinsufficient mice. Our results suggest that endogenous gene up-regulation could be a potential strategy to treat altered gene dosage diseases.

30544778	Genetic engineering of viruses has generally been challenging. This is also true for archaeal rod-shaped viruses, which carry linear double-stranded DNA genomes with hairpin ends. In this paper, we describe two different genome editing approaches to mutate the Sulfolobus islandicus rod-shaped virus 2 (SIRV2) using the archaeon Sulfolobus islandicus LAL14/1 and its derivatives as hosts. The anti-CRISPR (Acr) gene acrID1, which inhibits CRISPR-Cas subtype I-D immunity, was first used as a selection marker to knock out genes from SIRV2M, an acrID1-null mutant of SIRV2. Moreover, we harnessed the endogenous CRISPR-Cas systems of the host to knock out the accessory genes consecutively, which resulted in a genome comprised solely of core genes of the 11 SIRV members. Furthermore, infection of this series of knockout mutants in the CRISPR-null host of LAL14/1 (Δarrays) confirmed the non-essentiality of the deleted genes and all except the last deletion mutant propagated as efficiently as the WT SIRV2. This suggested that the last gene deleted, SIRV2 gp37, is important for the efficient viral propagation. The generated viral mutants will be useful for future functional studies including searching for new Acrs and the approaches described in this case are applicable to other viruses.

30523262	Bmal1 is one of the key molecules that controls the mammalian molecular clock. In humans, two isoforms of Bmal1 are generated by alternative RNA splicing. Unlike the extensively studied hBmal1b, the canonical form of Bmal1 in most species, the expression and/or function of another human-specific isoform, hBmal1a, are poorly understood. Due to the lack of the N-terminal nuclear localization signal (NLS), hBMAL1a does not enter the nucleus as hBMAL1b does. However, despite the lack of the NLS, hBMAL1a still dimerizes with either hCLOCK or hBMAL1b and thereby promotes cytoplasmic retention or protein degradation, respectively. Consequently, hBMAL1a interferes with hCLOCK:hBMAL1b-induced transcriptional activation and the circadian oscillation of Period2. Moreover, when the expression of endogenous hBmal1a is aborted by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout, the rhythmic expression of hPer2 and hBmal1b is restored in cultured HeLa cells. Together, these results suggest a role for hBMAL1a as a negative regulator of the mammalian molecular clock.	J Lee|E Park|GH Kim|I Kwon|K Kim
30540162	Accurate and efficient delivery of genome editing plasmids to targeted cells is of critical importance in genome editing. Herein, we prepared a multifunctional delivery vector with a combination of ligand-mediated selectivity and peptide-mediated transmembrane function to effectively deliver plasmids to targeted cancerous cells. In the delivery system, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat-associated Cas9 nuclease (CRISPR-Cas9) plasmid is combined with protamine with membrane and nuclear translocating activities and co-precipitated with CaCO3, which is further decorated by AS1411-functionalized carboxymethyl chitosan and cell penetrating peptide (TAT)-functionalized carboxymethyl chitosan. The AS1411-mediated tumor cell/nuclear targeting and TAT-induced enhanced endocytosis result in obviously increased cellular uptake and nuclear transport. As a result, the CRISPR-Cas9 plasmid can be efficiently delivered to cancer cell nuclei to mediate genome editing, resulting in an efficacious knockout of CTNNB1 gene encoding β-catenin. More importantly, downregulation of β-catenin could effectively prevent its enrichment in nuclei and then significantly downregulate the expression of proteins, such as vimentin, Snail, MMP-2, MMP-9, CD44, Nanog, and Oct4 to prevent tumor progression and metastasis. The edited cancerous cells exhibit favorable remodulated properties including inhibited growth, suppressed migration and invasion, and reduced cancer stemness.	XY He|BY Liu|Y Peng|RX Zhuo|SX Cheng
30539698	Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)/nodal signaling is involved in early embryonic patterning in vertebrates. Nodal modulator (Nomo, also called pM5) is a negative regulator of nodal signaling. Currently, the role of nomo gene in cartilage development in vertebrates remains unknown.	Nomo mutants were generated in a knockout model of zebrafish by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) targeting of the fibronectin type III domain. The expression of related genes, which are critical for chondrogenesis, was analyzed by whole-mount in situ hybridization and qRT-PCR. Whole-mount alcian staining was performed to analyze the cartilage structure.	nomo is highly expressed in various tissues including the cartilage. We successfully constructed a zebrafish nomo knockout model. nomo homozygous mutants exhibited varying degrees of hypoplasia and dysmorphism on 4 and 5 dpf, which is similar to chondrodysplasia in humans. The key genes of cartilage and skeletal development, including sox9a, sox9b, dlx1a, dlx2a, osx, col10a1, and col11a2 were all downregulated in nomo mutants compared with the wildtype.	The nomo gene positively regulates the expression of the master regulator and other key development genes involved in bone formation and cartilage development and it is essential for cartilage development in zebrafish.

30532030	Ataxia telangiectasia mutated and RAD3 related (ATR) protein kinase plays critical roles in ensuring DNA replication, DNA repair, and cell cycle control in response to replication stress, making ATR inhibition a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment. To identify genes whose loss makes tumor cells hypersensitive to ATR inhibition, we performed CRISPR/Cas9-based whole-genome screens in 3 independent cell lines treated with a highly selective ATR inhibitor, AZD6738. These screens uncovered a comprehensive genome-wide profile of ATR inhibitor sensitivity. From the candidate genes, we demonstrated that RNASEH2 deficiency is synthetic lethal with ATR inhibition both in vitro and in vivo. RNASEH2-deficient cells exhibited elevated levels of DNA damage and, when treated with AZD6738, underwent apoptosis (short-time treated) or senescence (long-time treated). Notably, RNASEH2 deficiency is frequently found in prostate adenocarcinoma; we found decreased RNASEH2B protein levels in prostate adenocarcinoma patient-derived xenograft (PDX) samples. Our findings suggest that ATR inhibition may be beneficial for cancer patients with reduced levels of RNASEH2 and that RNASEH2 merits further exploration as a potential biomarker for ATR inhibitor-based therapy.

30531984	Predictable control over gene expression is essential to elicit desired synthetic cellular phenotypes.

30531928	15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH), the rate-limiting enzyme in prostaglandin E2 degradation, is decreased in gastric cancers and microRNA (miR)-21 is one of the regulators. We investigated the expression and regulation of 15-PGDH in eary gastric carcinogenesis utilizing endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) and gastric cancer cell lines. Expression of 15-PGDH and cyclooxygenase-2 as well as the promoter methylation of 15-PGDH were evaluted. CRISPR, miR-21 transfection, proliferation and apoptosis assays were also done. We observed significant decreases in 15-PGDH expression but no promoter methylation was detected in any ESDs. 15-PGDH suppression by CRISPR induced enhanced growth kinetics. miR-21, which was detected in high level in gastric tumors from the TGCA data, caused increased proliferation, decreased apoptosis. miR-21 overexpression was confirmed with CISH and RT-PCR in the ESDs. Loss of 15-PGDH occurs at the very early stage of gastric adenocarcinoma by miR-21. H. pylori infection may affect miR-21 up regulation. Maintaining 15-PGDH enzyme activity could be a new strategic measure in preventing gastric cancer especially tubular adenocarcinoma.

30529475	The pace of research towards a genetic model to understand the unique molecular biology of parasitic nematodes has increased recently. This research has developed a diverse suite of genetic tools for a variety of parasitic nematodes. CRISPR/Cas9 technology in particular offers much promise as a game changing tool for researchers studying parasitic nematodes. Unlike RNAi, which depends on diverse nematode effectors to silence gene expression, the effectors for CRISPR/Cas9 mutations are typically supplied by the experimenter, making gene editing via CRISPR/Cas9 ideal for testing on genetically intractable nematode systems. To facilitate the development of CRISPR/Cas9 technology for parasitic nematodes, I here describe a tool for identifying gRNA targets and diagnostic primers to a user supplied sequence. The software attempts to minimize non-specific targets by interrogating the genomes of parasitic nematodes. This software is freely available online and features an intuitive interface to help researchers design effective CRISPR experiments for parasitic nematodes.	DM O'Halloran
30526040	The purpose of current study is to find out relationship between cas9 gene and antimicrobial resistance in Campylobacter jejuni NCTC11168.	The involvement of the cas9 gene in antimicrobial resistance of C. jejuni was determined by assessment of minimum inhibitory concentration, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-cas gene expression in standard strains, in vitro resistance development and transcriptome analysis of a cas9 deletion mutant and wild strains.	Increased expression of CRISPR-related genes was observed in standard strains. We also observed that Δcas9 mutant strain is more sensitive to antibiotics than its wild strain. Transcriptome analysis revealed that cas9 gene regulate several genes to promote antimicrobial resistance in C. jejuni.

30520487	Human hepatic C3A cells have been applied in bioartificial liver development, although these cells display low intrinsic cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) enzyme activity. We aimed to enhance CYP3A4 enzyme activity of C3A cells utilizing CRISPR gene editing technology. We designed two CYP3A4 expression enhanced systems applying clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) gene technology: a CRISPR-on activation system including dCas9-VP64-GFP and two U6-sgRNA-mCherry elements, and a light-controlled CRISPR-on activation system combining our CRISPR-on activation system with an optical control system to facilitate regulation of CYP3A4 expression for various applications. Results of enzymatic activity assays displayed increased CYP3A4 activity in C3A cells expressing the CRISPR-on activation system compared with C3A cells. In addition, CYP3A4 activity increased in C3A cells expressing the light-controlled CRISPR-on activation system under blue light radiation compared with C3A cells. Notably, there was no statistical difference in the increase of CYP3A4 protein amounts induced by these two methods. After expansion in culture, C3A cells with the light-controlled CRISPR-on activation system exhibited no statistical difference in CYP3A4 mRNA levels between generations. Our findings provide a method to stably enhance functional gene expression in bioartificial liver cells with the potential for large-scale cell expansion.

30520167	With the development of synthetic biology, synthetic gene circuits have shown great applied potential in medicine, biology, and as commodity chemicals. An ultimate challenge in the construction of gene circuits is the lack of effective, programmable, secure and sequence-specific gene editing tools. The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) system, a CRISPR-associated RNA-guided endonuclease Cas9 (CRISPR-associated protein 9)-targeted genome editing tool, has recently been applied in engineering gene circuits for its unique properties-operability, high efficiency and programmability. The traditional single-targeted therapy cannot effectively distinguish tumour cells from normal cells, and gene therapy for single targets has poor anti-tumour effects, which severely limits the application of gene therapy. Currently, the design of gene circuits using tumour-specific targets based on CRISPR/Cas systems provides a new way for precision cancer therapy. Hence, the application of intelligentized gene circuits based on CRISPR technology effectively guarantees the safety, efficiency and specificity of cancer therapy. Here, we assessed the use of synthetic gene circuits and if the CRISPR system could be used, especially artificial switch-inducible Cas9, to more effectively target and treat tumour cells. Moreover, we also discussed recent advances, prospectives and underlying challenges in CRISPR-based gene circuit development.

30518723	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas-based genome editing technology has enabled manipulation of the embryonic genome. Unbiased whole genome sequencing comparing parents to progeny has revealed that the rate of Cas9-induced mutagenesis in mouse embryos is indistinguishable from the background rate of de novo mutation. However, establishing the best practice to confirm on-target alleles of interest remains a challenge. We believe that improvement in editing strategies and screening methods for founder mice will contribute to the generation of quality-controlled animals, thereby ensuring reproducibility of results in animal studies and advancing the 3Rs (replacement, reduction, and refinement).

30518686	Adeno-associated virus-mediated (AAV-mediated) CRISPR editing is a revolutionary approach for treating inherited diseases. Sustained, often life-long mutation correction is required for treating these diseases. Unfortunately, this has never been demonstrated with AAV CRISPR therapy. We addressed this question in the mdx model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). DMD is caused by dystrophin gene mutation. Dystrophin deficiency leads to ambulation loss and cardiomyopathy. We treated 6-week-old mice intravenously and evaluated disease rescue at 18 months. Surprisingly, nominal dystrophin was restored in skeletal muscle. Cardiac dystrophin was restored, but histology and hemodynamics were not improved. To determine the underlying mechanism, we evaluated components of the CRISPR-editing machinery. Intriguingly, we found disproportional guide RNA (gRNA) vector depletion. To test whether this is responsible for the poor outcome, we increased the gRNA vector dose and repeated the study. This strategy significantly increased dystrophin restoration and reduced fibrosis in all striated muscles at 18 months. Importantly, skeletal muscle function and cardiac hemodynamics were significantly enhanced. Interestingly, we did not see selective depletion of the gRNA vector after intramuscular injection. Our results suggest that gRNA vector loss is a unique barrier for systemic AAV CRISPR therapy. This can be circumvented by vector dose optimization.

30503774	Adaptive immune systems must accurately distinguish between self and non-self in order to defend against invading pathogens while avoiding autoimmunity. Type III CRISPR-Cas systems employ guide RNA to recognize complementary RNA targets, which triggers the degradation of both the invader's transcripts and their template DNA. These systems can broadly eliminate foreign targets with multiple mutations but circumvent damage to the host genome. To explore the molecular basis for these features, we use single-molecule fluorescence microscopy to study the interaction between a type III-A ribonucleoprotein complex and various RNA substrates. We find that Cas10-the DNase effector of the complex-displays rapid conformational fluctuations on foreign RNA targets, but is locked in a static configuration on self RNA. Target mutations differentially modulate Cas10 dynamics and tune the CRISPR interference activity in vivo. These findings highlight the central role of the internal dynamics of CRISPR-Cas complexes in self versus non-self discrimination and target specificity.

30503773	Type ΙΙΙ CRISPR-Cas systems provide robust immunity against foreign RNA and DNA by sequence-specific RNase and target RNA-activated sequence-nonspecific DNase and RNase activities. We report on cryo-EM structures of Thermococcus onnurineus CsmcrRNA binary, CsmcrRNA-target RNA and CsmcrRNA-target RNAanti-tag ternary complexes in the 3.1 Å range. The topological features of the crRNA 5'-repeat tag explains the 5'-ruler mechanism for defining target cleavage sites, with accessibility of positions -2 to -5 within the 5'-repeat serving as sensors for avoidance of autoimmunity. The Csm3 thumb elements introduce periodic kinks in the crRNA-target RNA duplex, facilitating cleavage of the target RNA with 6-nt periodicity. Key Glu residues within a Csm1 loop segment of CsmcrRNA adopt a proposed autoinhibitory conformation suggestive of DNase activity regulation. These structural findings, complemented by mutational studies of key intermolecular contacts, provide insights into CsmcrRNA complex assembly, mechanisms underlying RNA targeting and site-specific periodic cleavage, regulation of DNase cleavage activity, and autoimmunity suppression.

30503210	Csm, a type III-A CRISPR-Cas interference complex, is a CRISPR RNA (crRNA)-guided RNase that also possesses target RNA-dependent DNase and cyclic oligoadenylate (cOA) synthetase activities. However, the structural features allowing target RNA-binding-dependent activation of DNA cleavage and cOA generation remain unknown. Here, we report the structure of Csm in complex with crRNA together with structures of cognate or non-cognate target RNA bound Csm complexes. We show that depending on complementarity with the 5' tag of crRNA, the 3' anti-tag region of target RNA binds at two distinct sites of the Csm complex. Importantly, the interaction between the non-complementary anti-tag region of cognate target RNA and Csm1 induces a conformational change at the Csm1 subunit that allosterically activates DNA cleavage and cOA generation. Together, our structural studies provide crucial insights into the mechanistic processes required for crRNA-meditated sequence-specific RNA cleavage, RNA target-dependent non-specific DNA cleavage, and cOA generation.

30514786	In their natural settings, CRISPR-Cas systems play crucial roles in bacterial and archaeal adaptive immunity to protect against phages and other mobile genetic elements, and they are also widely used as genome engineering technologies. Previously we discovered bacteriophage-encoded Cas9-specific anti-CRISPR (Acr) proteins that serve as countermeasures against host bacterial immunity by inactivating their CRISPR-Cas systems (A. Pawluk, N. Amrani, Y. Zhang, B. Garcia, et al., Cell 167:1829-1838.e9, 2016, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2016.11.017). We hypothesized that the evolutionary advantages conferred by anti-CRISPRs would drive the widespread occurrence of these proteins in nature (K. L. Maxwell, Mol Cell 68:8-14, 2017, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2017.09.002; A. Pawluk, A. R. Davidson, and K. L. Maxwell, Nat Rev Microbiol 16:12-17, 2018, https://doi.org/10.1038/nrmicro.2017.120; E. J. Sontheimer and A. R. Davidson, Curr Opin Microbiol 37:120-127, 2017, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mib.2017.06.003). We have identified new anti-CRISPRs using the same bioinformatic approach that successfully identified previous Acr proteins (A. Pawluk, N. Amrani, Y. Zhang, B. Garcia, et al., Cell 167:1829-1838.e9, 2016, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2016.11.017) against Neisseria meningitidis Cas9 (NmeCas9). In this work, we report two novel anti-CRISPR families in strains of Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Simonsiella muelleri, both of which harbor type II-C CRISPR-Cas systems (A. Mir, A. Edraki, J. Lee, and E. J. Sontheimer, ACS Chem Biol 13:357-365, 2018, https://doi.org/10.1021/acschembio.7b00855). We characterize the type II-C Cas9 orthologs from H. parainfluenzae and S. muelleri, show that the newly identified Acrs are able to inhibit these systems, and define important features of their inhibitory mechanisms. The S. muelleri Acr is the most potent NmeCas9 inhibitor identified to date. Although inhibition of NmeCas9 by anti-CRISPRs from H. parainfluenzae and S. muelleri reveals cross-species inhibitory activity, more distantly related type II-C Cas9s are not inhibited by these proteins. The specificities of anti-CRISPRs and divergent Cas9s appear to reflect coevolution of their strategies to combat or evade each other. Finally, we validate these new anti-CRISPR proteins as potent off-switches for Cas9 genome engineering applications.IMPORTANCE As one of their countermeasures against CRISPR-Cas immunity, bacteriophages have evolved natural inhibitors known as anti-CRISPR (Acr) proteins. Despite the existence of such examples for type II CRISPR-Cas systems, we currently know relatively little about the breadth of Cas9 inhibitors, and most of their direct Cas9 targets are uncharacterized. In this work we identify two new type II-C anti-CRISPRs and their cognate Cas9 orthologs, validate their functionality in vitro and in bacteria, define their inhibitory spectrum against a panel of Cas9 orthologs, demonstrate that they act before Cas9 DNA binding, and document their utility as off-switches for Cas9-based tools in mammalian applications. The discovery of diverse anti-CRISPRs, the mechanistic analysis of their cognate Cas9s, and the definition of Acr inhibitory mechanisms afford deeper insight into the interplay between Cas9 orthologs and their inhibitors and provide greater scope for exploiting Acrs for CRISPR-based genome engineering.

30514784	CRISPR DNA arrays of unique spacers separated by identical repeats ensure prokaryotic immunity through specific targeting of foreign nucleic acids complementary to spacers. New spacers are acquired into a CRISPR array in a process of CRISPR adaptation. Selection of foreign DNA fragments to be integrated into CRISPR arrays relies on PAM (protospacer adjacent motif) recognition, as only those spacers will be functional against invaders. However, acquisition of different PAM-associated spacers proceeds with markedly different efficiency from the same DNA. Here, we used a combination of bioinformatics and experimental approaches to understand factors affecting the efficiency of acquisition of spacers by the Escherichia coli type I-E CRISPR-Cas system, for which two modes of CRISPR adaptation have been described: naive and primed. We found that during primed adaptation, efficiency of spacer acquisition is strongly negatively affected by the presence of an AAG trinucleotide-a consensus PAM-within the sequence being selected. No such trend is observed during naive adaptation. The results are consistent with a unidirectional spacer selection process during primed adaptation and provide a specific signature for identification of spacers acquired through primed adaptation in natural populations.IMPORTANCE Adaptive immunity of prokaryotes depends on acquisition of foreign DNA fragments into CRISPR arrays as spacers followed by destruction of foreign DNA by CRISPR interference machinery. Different fragments are acquired into CRISPR arrays with widely different efficiencies, but the factors responsible are not known. We analyzed the frequency of spacers acquired during primed adaptation in an E. coli CRISPR array and found that AAG motif was depleted from highly acquired spacers. AAG is also a consensus protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) that must be present upstream from the target of the CRISPR spacer for its efficient destruction by the interference machinery. These results are important because they provide new information on the mechanism of primed spacer acquisition. They add to other previous evidence in the field that pointed out to a "directionality" in the capture of new spacers. Our data strongly suggest that the recognition of an AAG PAM by the interference machinery components prior to spacer capture occludes downstream AAG sequences, thus preventing their recognition by the adaptation machinery.

30511992	The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) system of genome editing represents a major technological advance spanning all areas of genetics and downstream applications. CRISPR's potential impact on treating human disease encompasses all clinical specialties, including areas important to the plastic surgeon such as oncology, wound healing, immunology, and craniofacial malformations. Plastic surgeons should gain familiarity with this gene editing technology, and become active contributors and leaders in applying CRISPR to their respective areas of expertise. This review describes the history and basic mechanism of CRISPR genome editing, highlights current and future applications, and discusses limitations. The authors will consider CRISPR's potential impact and use in plastic and reconstructive surgery.	DS Roh|EB Li|EC Liao
30510222	Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) is a key sensor responsible for cytosolic DNA detection. Here we report that GTPase-activating protein SH3 domain-binding protein 1 (G3BP1) is critical for DNA sensing and efficient activation of cGAS. G3BP1 enhanced DNA binding of cGAS by promoting the formation of large cGAS complexes. G3BP1 deficiency led to inefficient DNA binding by cGAS and inhibited cGAS-dependent interferon (IFN) production. The G3BP1 inhibitor epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) disrupted existing G3BP1-cGAS complexes and inhibited DNA-triggered cGAS activation, thereby blocking DNA-induced IFN production both in vivo and in vitro. EGCG administration blunted self DNA-induced autoinflammatory responses in an Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS) mouse model and reduced IFN-stimulated gene expression in cells from a patient with AGS. Thus, our study reveals that G3BP1 physically interacts with and primes cGAS for efficient activation. Furthermore, EGCG-mediated inhibition of G3BP1 provides a potential treatment for cGAS-related autoimmune diseases.

30510171	The deep terrestrial biosphere harbours a substantial fraction of Earth's biomass and remains understudied compared with other ecosystems. Deep biosphere life primarily consists of bacteria and archaea, yet knowledge of their co-occurring viruses is poor. Here, we temporally catalogued viral diversity from five deep terrestrial subsurface locations (hydraulically fractured wells), examined virus-host interaction dynamics and experimentally assessed metabolites from cell lysis to better understand viral roles in this ecosystem. We uncovered high viral diversity, rivalling that of peatland soil ecosystems, despite low host diversity. Many viral operational taxonomic units were predicted to infect Halanaerobium, the dominant microorganism in these ecosystems. Examination of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-CRISPR-associated proteins (CRISPR-Cas) spacers elucidated lineage-specific virus-host dynamics suggesting active in situ viral predation of Halanaerobium. These dynamics indicate repeated viral encounters and changing viral host range across temporally and geographically distinct shale formations. Laboratory experiments showed that prophage-induced Halanaerobium lysis releases intracellular metabolites that can sustain key fermentative metabolisms, supporting the persistence of microorganisms in this ecosystem. Together, these findings suggest that diverse and active viral populations play critical roles in driving strain-level microbial community development and resource turnover within this deep terrestrial subsurface ecosystem.

30509339	The present study examined the effect of exogenous thrombospondin 1 (TSP1) on the steroidogenic function of luteal cells cultured invitro. Furthermore, the transcriptional interaction of insulin with TSP1 and its receptor, cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) were also investigated. At the highest dose (500ngmL-1) TSP1 significantly downregulated the expression of the angiogenic marker von Willebrand factor (vWF) and progesterone production in cultured luteal cells. Moreover, the simultaneous upregulation in the expression of caspase 3 by exogenous TSP1 was consistent with a reduction in the number of viable luteal cells as determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltertrazolium bromide (MTT) assay after 72h of culture. However, the expression of critical enzymes in the progesterone synthetic pathway was not significantly modulated by treatment with TSP1 in cultured luteal cells. Knocking out of endogenous TSP1 with the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/ CRISPRassociated protein9 (Cas9) system improved the viability of luteal cells as well as increasing progesterone production and decreasing caspase 3 activation. Insulin treatment suppressed the expression of TSP1 and CD36 in cultured luteal cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. To conclude, TSP1 acts as a negative endogenous regulator of angiogenesis that attenuates progesterone production, possibly by reducing the number of luteal cells via apoptosis during luteal regression, whereas insulin as a luteinising signal may have inhibited the thrombospondin system for the efficient development of luteal function.

30498221	The lack of efficient tools to image non-repetitive genes in living cells has limited our ability to explore the functional impact of the spatiotemporal dynamics of such genes. Here, we addressed this issue by developing a CRISPR-Tag system using one to four highly active sgRNAs to specifically label protein-coding genes with a high signal-to-noise ratio for visualization by wide-field fluorescence microscopy. Our approach involves assembling a CRISPR-Tag within the intron region of a fluorescent protein and then integrating this cassette to N- or C-terminus of a specific gene, which enables simultaneous real-time imaging of protein and DNA of human protein-coding genes, such as HIST2H2BE, LMNA and HSPA8 in living cells. This CRISPR-Tag system, with a minimal size of ~250 bp DNA tag, represents an easily and broadly applicable technique to study the spatiotemporal organization of genomic elements in living cells.

30488815	Salmon farming is a key industry in Norway, with firsthand value of more than 60 billion Norwegian crowns in 2017. The salmon industry is a driving force for biotechnological applications in the marine sector. The recent release of the Atlantic salmon reference genome offers new opportunities to solve major aquaculture bottlenecks that currently limit expansion of the industry. One major bottleneck is the genetic impact of escaped farmed salmon on wild populations. To solve this problem, the industry can use sterile salmon in production. As shown by Wargelius et al., sterile salmon can be made by preventing the formation of germ cells through genome editing using the CRISPR-Cas9 method. This approach solves problems of genetic introgression and precocious maturation. However, genome editing of animals, especially for human consumption, raises ethical as well as safety and legal questions. These social and ethical aspects can have tremendous impact in analyzing the final result of salmon farming (e.g., consumer acceptability of a fresh or frozen filet or similar salmon product) but also can be examined "upstream" by describing and assessing the research communities that promote and carry out the science that underpins the salmon industry. Who produces the scientific "facts" that govern the Norwegian aquaculture industry? How do these scientific communities work together? What are the societal impacts of this science? This article uses ethnographical observation and interviews to describe the state-of-the-art of CRISPR gene-editing procedures currently employed in the science and industry collaboration in Norway.

30487602	The entry of foreign DNA into many mammalian cell types triggers the innate immune system, a complex set of responses to prevent infection by pathogens. One aspect of the response is the potent epigenetic silencing of incoming viral DNAs1, including the extrachromosomal DNAs that are formed immediately after infection by retroviruses. These unintegrated viral DNAs are very poorly transcribed in all cells, even in permissive cells, in contrast to the robust expression that is observed after viral integration2-5. The factors that are responsible for this low expression have not yet been identified. Here we performed a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen for genes that are required for silencing an integrase-deficient MLV-GFP reporter virus to explore the mechanisms responsible for repression of unintegrated viral DNAs in human cells. Our screen identified the DNA-binding protein NP220, the three proteins (MPP8, TASOR and PPHLN1) that comprise the HUSH complex-which silences proviruses in heterochromatin6 and retrotransposons7,8-the histone methyltransferase SETDB1, and other host factors that are required for silencing. Further tests by chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that NP220 is the key protein that recruits the HUSH complex, SETDB1 and the histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC4 to silence the unintegrated retroviral DNA. Knockout of NP220 accelerates the replication of retroviruses. These experiments identify the molecular machinery that silences extrachromosomal retroviral DNA.	Y Zhu|GZ Wang|O Cingöz|SP Goff
30487242	Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common type of RCC in humans. SET domain-containing 2 (SETD2), a lysine methyltransferase for histone and other proteins, has been found to be frequently lost in ccRCC. However, the mechanisms through which deficiency in SETD2 contributes to ccRCC development remain largely unknown. Here, we used a human embryonic kidney epithelial cell line with the SETD2 gene being knocked out using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Using ChIP-seq analysis, we showed that SETD2 loss leads to diminished occupancy of histone H3K36me3 and H4K16ac on actively transcribed genes. Transcriptome sequencing of the knockout cells revealed diminished expression of genes involved in metabolic pathways and elevated expression of genes involved in regulation of RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription. Quantitative proteomic analysis of chromatin-associated proteins showed that genetic ablation of SETD2 leads to elevated chromatin occupancy of proteins involved in chromatin remodeling and RNA polymerase II transcription regulation, and diminished chromatin binding of proteins involved in translation elongation and RNA splicing. Interestingly, we found that SETD2 depletion attenuates cell proliferation, and this can be rescued by knockdown of CDK1. Taken together, we illustrate multiple SETD2-regulated cellular pathways that suppress cancer development and uncover mechanisms underlying aberrant cell cycle regulation in SETD2-depleted cells.

30486613	The discovery and mechanistic understanding of target-specific genome engineering technologies has led to extremely effective and specific genome editing in higher organisms. Target-specific genetic modification technology is expected to have a leading position in future gene therapy development, and has a ripple effect on various basic and applied studies. However, several problems remain and hinder efficient and specific editing of target genomic loci. The issues are particularly critical in precise targeted insertion of external DNA sequences into genomes. Here, we discuss some recent efforts to overcome such problems and present a perspective of future genome editing technologies.	SH Lee|S Kim|JK Hur
30478436	Physical interaction of regulatory elements in three-dimensional space poses a challenge for studies of disease because non-coding risk variants may be great distances from the genes they regulate. Experimental methods to capture these interactions, such as chromosome conformation capture, usually cannot assign causal direction of effect between regulatory elements, an important component of fine-mapping studies. We developed a Bayesian hierarchical approach that uses two-stage least squares and applied it to an ATAC-seq (assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing) data set from 100 individuals, to identify over 15,000 high-confidence causal interactions. Most (60%) interactions occurred over <20 kb, where chromosome conformation capture-based methods perform poorly. For a fraction of loci, we identified a single variant that alters accessibility across multiple regions, and experimentally validated the BLK locus, which is associated with multiple autoimmune diseases, using CRISPR genome editing. Our study highlights how association genetics of chromatin state is a powerful approach for identifying interactions between regulatory elements.	N Kumasaka|AJ Knights|DJ Gaffney
30478289	CRISPR-Cas systems provide prokaryotes with sequence-specific immunity against viruses and plasmids based on DNA acquired from these invaders, known as spacers. Surprisingly, many archaea possess spacers that match chromosomal genes of related species, including those encoding core housekeeping genes. By sequencing genomes of environmental archaea isolated from a single site, we demonstrate that inter-species spacers are common. We show experimentally, by mating Haloferax volcanii and Haloferax mediterranei, that spacers are indeed acquired chromosome-wide, although a preference for integrated mobile elements and nearby regions of the chromosome exists. Inter-species mating induces increased spacer acquisition and may result in interactions between the acquisition machinery of the two species. Surprisingly, many of the spacers acquired following inter-species mating target self-replicons along with those originating from the mating partner, indicating that the acquisition machinery cannot distinguish self from non-self under these conditions. Engineering the chromosome of one species to be targeted by the other's CRISPR-Cas reduces gene exchange between them substantially. Thus, spacers acquired during inter-species mating could limit future gene transfer, resulting in a role for CRISPR-Cas systems in microbial speciation.

30470168	The recently discovered clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cpf1 system expands the genome editing toolbox. This system exhibits several distinct features compared to the widely used CRISPR-Cas9 system, but has reduced gene editing efficiency. To optimize the CRISPR-Cpf1 (Cas12a) system, we report the inclusion of self-cleaving ribozymes that facilitate processing of the crRNA transcript to produce the precise guide molecule. Insertion of the 3'-terminal HDV ribozyme boosted the gene editing activity of the CRISPR-Cpf1 system ranging from 1.1 to 5.2 fold. We also demonstrate that this design can enhance CRISPR-based gene activation. We thus generated an improved CRISPR-Cpf1 system for more efficient gene editing and gene regulation.

30467079	Drosophila Dpr (21 paralogs) and DIP proteins (11 paralogs) are cell recognition molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) that form a complex protein interaction network. DIP and Dpr proteins are expressed in a synaptic layer-specific fashion in the visual system. How interactions between these proteins regulate layer-specific synaptic circuitry is not known. Here we establish that DIP-α and its interacting partners Dpr6 and Dpr10 regulate multiple processes, including arborization within layers, synapse number, layer specificity, and cell survival. We demonstrate that heterophilic binding between Dpr6/10 and DIP-α and homophilic binding between DIP-α proteins promote interactions between processes in vivo. Knockin mutants disrupting the DIP/Dpr binding interface reveal a role for these proteins during normal development, while ectopic expression studies support an instructive role for interactions between DIPs and Dprs in circuit development. These studies support an important role for the DIP/Dpr protein interaction network in regulating cell-type-specific connectivity patterns.

30463924	Ndt80 family transcription factors are highly conserved in fungi, where they regulate diverse processes. The human fungal pathogen Candida albicans contains three genes (NDT80, REP1, and RON1) that encode proteins with similarity to Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ndt80, although the homology is restricted to the DNA binding domain. To better understand their role in virulence functions, we used clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat/CRISPR-associated gene 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) to delete the three NDT80-family genes. An ndt80Δ mutant showed strong defects in forming hyphae in response to serum or N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), which was linked to the ability of Ndt80 to regulate the expression of RAS1, an upstream regulator of hyphal signaling. Conversely, the ndt80Δ mutant formed hyphal cells on glycerol medium, indicating that Ndt80 is not required for hyphal growth under all conditions. In contrast to our previously published data, a ron1Δ single mutant could grow and form hyphae in response to GlcNAc. However, deleting RON1 partially restored the ability of an ndt80Δ mutant to form hyphae in response to GlcNAc, indicating a link to GlcNAc signaling. REP1 was required for growth on GlcNAc, as expected, but not for GlcNAc or serum to induce hyphae. The ndt80Δ mutant was defective in growing under stressful conditions, such as elevated temperature, but not the ron1Δ mutant or rep1Δ mutant. Quantitative assays did not reveal any significant differences in the fluconazole susceptibility of the NDT80-family mutants. Interestingly, double and triple mutant analysis did not identify significant genetic interactions for these NDT80 family genes, indicating that they mainly function independently, in spite of their conserved DNA binding domain.IMPORTANCE Transcription factors play key roles in regulating virulence of the human fungal pathogen C. albicans In addition to regulating the expression of virulence factors, they also control the ability of C. albicans to switch to filamentous hyphal growth, which facilitates biofilm formation on medical devices and invasion into tissues. We therefore used new CRISPR/Cas9 methods to examine the effects of deleting three C. albicans genes (NDT80, REP1, and RON1) that encode transcription factors with similar DNA binding domains. Interestingly, double and triple mutant strains mostly showed the combined properties of the single mutants; there was only very limited evidence of synergistic interactions in regulating morphogenesis, stress resistance, and ability to metabolize different sugars. These results demonstrate that NDT80, REP1, and RON1 have distinct functions in regulating C. albicans virulence functions.	K Min|A Biermann|DA Hogan|JB Konopka
30462485	Sequence to activity mapping technologies are rapidly developing, enabling the generation and isolation of mutations conferring novel phenotypes. Here we used the CRISPR enabled trackable genome engineering (CREATE) technology to investigate the inhibition of the essential ispC gene in its native genomic context in Escherichia coli. We created a full saturation library of 33 sites proximal to the ligand binding pocket and challenged this library with the antimalarial drug fosmidomycin, which targets the ispC gene product, DXR. This selection is especially challenging since it is relatively weak in E. coli, with multiple naturally occurring pathways for resistance. We identified several previously unreported mutations that confer fosmidomycin resistance, in highly conserved sites that also exist in pathogens including the malaria-inducing Plasmodium falciparum. This approach may have implications for the isolation of resistance-conferring mutations and may affect the design of future generations of fosmidomycin-based drugs.

30449619	Human T cells are central effectors of immunity and cancer immunotherapy. CRISPR-based functional studies in T cells could prioritize novel targets for drug development and improve the design of genetically reprogrammed cell-based therapies. However, large-scale CRISPR screens have been challenging in primary human cells. We developed a new method, single guide RNA (sgRNA) lentiviral infection with Cas9 protein electroporation (SLICE), to identify regulators of stimulation responses in primary human T cells. Genome-wide loss-of-function screens identified essential T cell receptor signaling components and genes that negatively tune proliferation following stimulation. Targeted ablation of individual candidate genes characterized hits and identified perturbations that enhanced cancer cell killing. SLICE coupled with single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed signature stimulation-response gene programs altered by key genetic perturbations. SLICE genome-wide screening was also adaptable to identify mediators of immunosuppression, revealing genes controlling responses to adenosine signaling. The SLICE platform enables unbiased discovery and characterization of functional gene targets in primary cells.

30429597	Genomic manipulation is essential to the use of model organisms to understand development, regeneration and adult physiology. The axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum), a type of salamander, exhibits an unparalleled regenerative capability in a spectrum of complex tissues and organs, and therefore serves as a powerful animal model for dissecting mechanisms of regeneration. We describe here an optimized stepwise protocol to create genetically modified axolotls using the CRISPR-Cas9 system. The protocol, which takes 7-8 weeks to complete, describes generation of targeted gene knockouts and knock-ins and includes site-specific integration of large targeting constructs. The direct use of purified CAS9-NLS (CAS9 containing a C-terminal nuclear localization signal) protein allows the prompt formation of guide RNA (gRNA)-CAS9-NLS ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes, which accelerates the creation of double-strand breaks (DSBs) at targeted genomic loci in single-cell-stage axolotl eggs. With this protocol, a substantial number of F0 individuals harboring a homozygous-type frameshift mutation can be obtained, allowing phenotype analysis in this generation. In the presence of targeting constructs, insertions of exogenous genes into targeted axolotl genomic loci can be achieved at efficiencies of up to 15% in a non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) manner. Our protocol bypasses the long generation time of axolotls and allows direct functional analysis in F0 genetically manipulated axolotls. This protocol can be potentially applied to other animal models, especially to organisms with a well-characterized transcriptome but lacking a well-characterized genome.

30426260	In 2015, a group of 18 scientists and bioethicists published an editorial in Science calling for "open discourse on the use of CRISPR-Cas9 technology to manipulate the human genome" and recommending that steps be taken to strongly discourage "any attempts at germline genome modification" in humans with this powerful new technology. Press reports compared the essay to a letter written by Paul Berg and 10 other scientists in 1974, also published in Science, calling for a voluntary deferral of certain types of recombinant DNA experimentation. A rhetorical analysis of the metaphors in these two documents, and in the summary statements that came out of the respective National Academy of Sciences conferences they instigated, shows that while they have a lot in common, they are different in at least one important way. The more recent texts deploy conceptual metaphors that portray the biotechnology in question as an autonomous agent, subtly suggesting an inevitability to its development, in contrast to the earlier texts, which portray the scientists who are using the technology as the primary agents who take action. Rhetorical moves depicting biotechnology as an agent in the 2015 texts hint at contemporary skepticism about whether humans can restrain the forward momentum of science and technology in a global context, thus inhibiting scientists from imagining a consequential role for themselves in shaping the future of responsible research.

30426198	The CRISPR/Cas technology has recently become the tool of choice for targeted genome modification in plants and beyond. Although CRSIPR/Cas offers a rapid and facile way of introducing changes at genomic loci of interest, its application is associated with off-targeting, i.e. introduction of unintended mutations at off-target sites within the genome, which has been reported frequently in the mammalian field. Here we summarise the current knowledge on the precision of CRISPR/Cas in plant systems and provide a summary of state-of the-art strategies for avoiding off-target mutations, as well as unintended on-target changes, in plants. These include using natural (e.g. Cas12a) or engineered (e.g. SpCas9-HF) CRISPR/Cas nucleases characterised by higher precision, as compared to the commonly used wild type SpCas9. In addition, we discuss the usage of CRISPR/Cas nucleases in the form of ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) as an option for reducing off-targeting in plants. Finally, we conclude that the most important factor for reducing CRISPR/Cas off-targeting remains careful selection of target sequences, for which we provide an overview of available online software tools and experimental guidance.

30425154	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-associated (CRISPR-Cas) systems are adaptive defense systems that protect bacteria and archaea from invading genetic elements. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, quorum sensing (QS) induces the CRISPR-Cas defense system at high cell density when the risk of bacteriophage infection is high. Here, we show that another cue, temperature, modulates P. aeruginosa CRISPR-Cas. Increased CRISPR adaptation occurs at environmental (i.e., low) temperatures compared to that at body (i.e., high) temperature. This increase is a consequence of the accumulation of CRISPR-Cas complexes, coupled with reduced P. aeruginosa growth rate at the lower temperature, the latter of which provides additional time prior to cell division for CRISPR-Cas to patrol the cell and successfully eliminate and/or acquire immunity to foreign DNA. Analyses of a QS mutant and synthetic QS compounds show that the QS and temperature cues act synergistically. The diversity and level of phage encountered by P. aeruginosa in the environment exceed that in the human body, presumably warranting increased reliance on CRISPR-Cas at environmental temperatures.IMPORTANCEP. aeruginosa is a soil dwelling bacterium and a plant pathogen, and it also causes life-threatening infections in humans. Thus, P. aeruginosa thrives in diverse environments and over a broad range of temperatures. Some P. aeruginosa strains rely on the CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune system as a phage defense mechanism. Our discovery that low temperatures increase CRISPR adaptation suggests that the rarely occurring but crucial naive adaptation events may take place predominantly under conditions of slow growth, e.g., during the bacterium's soil dwelling existence and during slow growth in biofilms.

30424596	Construction of pooled genetic variant libraries has become very fast and versatile. The current limitation of this technique is to select cells with a desired phenotype from very large libraries. Especially cells with poor fitness and slow growth are difficult to select because they are rapidly outcompeted by fitter cells. Here, we demonstrate selective and high-throughput enrichment of slow-growing strains using a fluorescent TIMER protein and flow cytometry. As a proof of principle, we created a metabolism-wide CRISPR interference library for Escherichia coli and enriched targets that interfere with amino acid metabolism. After enrichment of slow-growing cells, the CRISPRi library consisted almost entirely of targets that block amino acid biosynthesis. These results provide general guidelines for how to enrich slow-growing strains from a large pool of genetic variants, with applications in genetic screens, metabolic engineering, and synthetic biology.

30421614	The-state-of-the-art bio- and nanotechnology have opened up an avenue to noninvasive liquid biopsy for identifying diseases from biomolecules in bloodstream, especially DNA. In this work, we combined sequence-specific-labeling scheme using mutated clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats associated protein 9 without endonuclease activity (CRISPR/dCas9) and ion concentration polarization (ICP) phenomenon as a mechanism to selectively preconcentrate targeted DNA molecules for rapid and direct detection. Theoretical analysis on ICP phenomenon figured out a critical mobility, elucidating two distinguishable concentrating behaviors near a nanojunction, a stacking and a propagating behavior. Through the modulation of the critical mobility to shift those behaviors, the C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) sequences were optically detected without PCR amplification. Conclusively, the proposed dCas9-mediated genetic detection methodology based on ICP would provide rapid and accurate micro/nanofluidic platform of liquid biopsies for disease diagnostics.

30420498	Drug resistance is an obstacle to global malaria control, as evidenced by the recent emergence and rapid spread of delayed artemisinin (ART) clearance by mutant forms of the PfKelch13 protein in Southeast Asia. Identifying genetic determinants of ART resistance in African-derived parasites is important for surveillance and for understanding the mechanism of resistance. In this study, we carried out long-term in vitro selection of two recently isolated West African parasites (from Pikine and Thiès, Senegal) with increasing concentrations of dihydroartemisinin (DHA), the biologically active form of ART, over a 4-y period. We isolated two parasite clones, one from each original isolate, that exhibited enhanced survival to DHA in the ring-stage survival assay. Whole-genome sequence analysis identified 10 mutations in seven different genes. We chose to focus on the gene encoding PfCoronin, a member of the WD40-propeller domain protein family, because mutations in this gene occurred in both independent selections, and the protein shares the β-propeller motif with PfKelch13 protein. For functional validation, when pfcoronin mutations were introduced into the parental parasites by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing, these mutations were sufficient to reduce ART susceptibility in the parental lines. The discovery of a second gene for ART resistance may yield insights into the molecular mechanisms of resistance. It also suggests that pfcoronin mutants could emerge as a nonkelch13 type of resistance to ART in natural settings.

30415491	Auxin is an important plant hormone that is essential for growth and development due to its effects on organogenesis, morphogenesis, tropisms, and apical dominance. The functional diversity of auxin highlights the importance of its biosynthesis, transport, and associated responses. In this study, we show that a NAC transcription factor, ANAC092 (also named AtNAC2 and ORESARA1), known to positively regulate leaf senescence and contribute to abiotic stress responses, also affects primary root development. Plants overexpressing ANAC092 had altered root meristem lengths and shorter primary roots compared with the wild-type control. Additionally, expression of the proANAC092::GUS was strongly induced by indole-3-acetic acid. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed that the YUCCA2, PIN, and ARF expression levels were downregulated in ANAC092-overexpressing plants. Moreover, yeast one-hybrid and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that ANAC092 binds to the promoters of AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 8 (ARF8) and PIN-FORMED 4 (PIN4). Furthermore, a dual-luciferase assay indicated that ANAC092 decreases ARF8 and PIN4 promoter activities. We also applied a CRISPR/Cas9 system to mutate ANAC092. The roots of three of the analyzed mutants were longer than normal. Collectively, our findings indicate that ANAC092 negatively affects root development by controlling the auxin pathway.

30413470	To investigate whether and how CRISPR-Cas9 on-target and off-target activities are affected by chromatin in eukaryotic cells, we first identified a series of identical endogenous DNA sequences present in both open and closed chromatin regions and then measured mutation frequencies at these sites in human cells using Cas9 complexed with matched or mismatched sgRNAs. Unlike matched sgRNAs, mismatched sgRNAs were highly sensitive to chromatin states, suggesting that off-target but not on-target DNA cleavage is hindered by chromatin. We next performed Digenome-seq using cell-free chromatin DNA (now termed DIG-seq) and histone-free genomic DNA in parallel and found that only a subset of sites, cleaved in histone-free DNA, were cut in chromatin DNA, suggesting that chromatin can inhibit Cas9 off-target effects in favor of its genome-wide specificity in cells.

30408033	The transcription factor NKX2.1, expressed at high levels in the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE), is a master regulator of cortical interneuron progenitor development. To identify gene candidates with expression profiles similar to NKX2.1, previous transcriptome analysis of human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived MGE-like progenitors revealed SFTA3 as the strongest candidate. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of hESC-derived NKX2.1-positive progenitors and transcriptome data available from the Allen Institute for Brain Science revealed comparable expression patterns for NKX2.1 and SFTA3 during interneuron differentiation in vitro and demonstrated high SFTA3 expression in the human MGE. Although SFTA3 has been well studied in the lung, the possible role of this surfactant protein in the MGE during embryonic development remains unexamined. To determine if SFTA3 plays a role in MGE specification, SFTA3-/- and NKX2.1 -/- hESC lines were generated using custom designed CRISPRs. We show that NKX2.1 KOs have a significantly diminished capacity to differentiate into MGE interneuron subtypes. SFTA3 KOs also demonstrated a somewhat reduced ability to differentiate down the MGE-like lineage, although not as severe relative to NKX2.1 deficiency. These results suggest NKX2.1 and SFTA3 are co-regulated genes, and that deletion of SFTA3 does not lead to a major change in the specification of MGE derivatives.

30397343	Type IV CRISPR-Cas modules belong to class 1 prokaryotic adaptive immune systems, which are defined by the presence of multisubunit effector complexes. They usually lack the known Cas proteins involved in adaptation and target cleavage, and their function has not been experimentally addressed. To investigate RNA and protein components of this CRISPR-Cas type, we located a complete type IV cas gene locus and an adjacent CRISPR array on a megaplasmid of Aromatoleum aromaticum EbN1, which contains an additional type I-C system on its chromosome. RNA sequencing analyses verified CRISPR RNA (crRNA) production and maturation for both systems. Type IV crRNAs were shown to harbour unusually short 7 nucleotide 5'-repeat tags and stable 3' hairpin structures. A unique Cas6 variant (Csf5) was identified that generates crRNAs that are specifically incorporated into type IV CRISPR-ribonucleoprotein (crRNP) complexes. Structures of RNA-bound Csf5 were obtained. Recombinant production and purification of the type IV Cas proteins, together with electron microscopy, revealed that Csf2 acts as a helical backbone for type IV crRNPs that include Csf5, Csf3 and a large subunit (Csf1). Mass spectrometry analyses identified protein-protein and protein-RNA contact sites. These results highlight evolutionary connections between type IV and type I CRISPR-Cas systems and demonstrate that type IV CRISPR-Cas systems employ crRNA-guided effector complexes.

30397336	Phagocytosis is required for a broad range of physiological functions, from pathogen defense to tissue homeostasis, but the mechanisms required for phagocytosis of diverse substrates remain incompletely understood. Here, we developed a rapid magnet-based phenotypic screening strategy, and performed eight genome-wide CRISPR screens in human cells to identify genes regulating phagocytosis of distinct substrates. After validating select hits in focused miniscreens, orthogonal assays and primary human macrophages, we show that (1) the previously uncharacterized gene NHLRC2 is a central player in phagocytosis, regulating RhoA-Rac1 signaling cascades that control actin polymerization and filopodia formation, (2) very-long-chain fatty acids are essential for efficient phagocytosis of certain substrates and (3) the previously uncharacterized Alzheimer's disease-associated gene TM2D3 can preferentially influence uptake of amyloid-β aggregates. These findings illuminate new regulators and core principles of phagocytosis, and more generally establish an efficient method for unbiased identification of cellular uptake mechanisms across diverse physiological and pathological contexts.

30394131	CRISPR technologies used for mammalian embryology have wide implications from basic research to applications in agriculture and biomedicine. Confirmation of successful gene editing following CRISPR/Cas9 delivery is often limited to either protein expression or sequencing analyses of embryos but not both, due to technical challenges. Herein we report an integrative approach for evaluating both protein expression and genotype of single embryos from fixed bovine embryos previously subjected to CRISPR/Cas9 microinjection. The techniques described facilitate investigation of functional genomics in bovine embryos compatible with gene editing in livestock after zygotic CRISPR microinjection. These methods avoid traditional avenues that necessitate the use of gene-edited cell lines followed by nuclear transfer that hinder efficiency, limit physiological relevance and contribute to technical challenges.

30393194	Genes, are the functional units of heredity that used as an instructors to make proteins either to become the functional or structural part of the cell. Hence, the proteins get more attention because most of the life functions depends on it. Any mutation or alteration in genome sequences results in complete loss of function or formation of abnormal protein which leads to hereditary disorder. Gene therapy on the other hand, used as a remedy, a process that make correction in the gene which is responsible for genomic disorders. The treatment of disease state depends on the understanding of their genetic basis. While, numerous molecular genome editing tools have been developed and are being utilized to translate the abstract of gene therapy into reality, but the problem is still a mystery. The genome editing molecular scissors can be applied to dictate the selected genetic products that can have the therapeutic power. Thus, editing the specific sequences depends on the type of strategies being used by a molecule such is HDR or NHEJ. CRISPR/Cas9 editing technology can use in disease model to study the genitival disorders. One side the CRISPR technology seemed to be extremely accurate but on the other side it has some harmful effects i.e. Cas9 proteins sometimes cuts the similar sequences other than the specific targeted and Off-targeting Sequences etc. Urgent attention and improvement are needed for various implication of CRISPR/Cas9 technology, including the delivery, precision and control over the mention system. This review presents the current scenario of genome editing in vivo and its implications for the future of human genetic disease treatment as well as genome throughput potency.

30391781	The study sought to explore novel genetic aberration driving squamous cell lung carcinoma (LUSC). The whole exome (WES), whole genome (WGS) and target region (TS) sequencings and CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing techniques were integrated to explore and validate novel targeting candidates from LUSC primary tumors and corresponding patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). Seven genes (FGFR2, GRM1,PIK3CG, PIK3CA,ZFHX4, CSMD3, GRM8) with high frequencies of both single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and copy number variants (CNVs), and two genes (CLDN1 and RIT1) only with CNVs were identified by bioinformatics analysis. The functions of these candidates were validated through CRISPR-Cas9 system in primary PDX cells. Furthermore, we focused on the genetic and functional analysis of Metabotropic glutamate receptor 8 (GRM8), whose transcriptional activation was elucidated to promote the survival of LUSC tumor cell through inhibiting cAMP pathway and activating MAPK pathway. The SNV identified in GRM8, A112G, activated downstream signaling pathway and induced cell proliferation, which could be reversed by cAMP stimulator and MEK inhibitor. In conclusion, the components of GRM8 signaling pathway could serve as potential targets of squamous cell lung cancer carrying GRM8 activating variants.

30390050	The CRISPR-Cas9 genome-editing tool and the availability of whole-genome sequences from plant species have revolutionized our ability to introduce targeted mutations into important crop plants, both to explore genetic changes and to introduce new functionalities. Here, we describe protocols adapting the CRISPR-Cas9 system to apple and grapevine plants, using both plasmid-mediated genome editing and the direct delivery of CRISPR-Cas9 ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) to achieve efficient DNA-free targeted mutations in apple and grapevine protoplasts. We provide a stepwise protocol for the design and transfer of CRISPR-Cas9 components to apple and grapevine protoplasts, followed by verification of highly efficient targeted mutagenesis, and regeneration of plants following the plasmid-mediated delivery of components. Our plasmid-mediated procedure and the direct delivery of CRISPR-Cas9 RNPs can both be utilized to modulate traits of interest with high accuracy and efficiency in apple and grapevine, and could be extended to other crop species. The complete protocol employing the direct delivery of CRISPR-Cas9 RNPs takes as little as 2-3 weeks, whereas the plasmid-mediated procedure takes >3 months to regenerate plants and study the mutations.

30389791	The CRISPR-Cas9 system has developed into a powerful platform for genome editing in various types of cells and tissues with single-nucleotide precision, but limited delivery options hamper its application in real-world settings. A new study by Shen et al. describes the use of an amphipathic peptide to deliver Cas9/sgRNA ribonucleoprotein complexes, leading to the disruption of GFP genes in cells and mice. Disruption of the Nrip1 gene in isolated pre-adipocytes led to a "browning" phenotype, pointing to new options in the fight against diabetes and obesity.	X Guan|Z Luo|W Sun
30389335	Streptococcus agalactiae (group B Streptococcus, GBS) remains the leading cause of invasive diseases in neonates and an important cause of infections in the elderly. The aim of this study was to access the prevalence of GBS genito-rectal colonisation of pregnant women and to evaluate the genetic characteristics of invasive and non-invasive GBS isolates recovered throughout Serbia. A total of 432 GBS isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility, capsular polysaccharide (CPS) types and the presence of the hvgA gene. One hundred one randomly selected isolates were further characterized by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) analysis and/or multilocus sequence typing (MLST). The prevalence of GBS colonization in pregnant women was 15%. Overall, six capsular types (Ia, Ib, II to V) were identified, the most common being III (32.2%) and V (25.2%). The hiper-virulent clone type III/ST17 was present in 43.1% and 6.3% (p < 0.05) of paediatric and adults isolates, respectively. Comparative sequence analysis of the CRISPR1 spacers content indicated that a few clones comprised the vast majority of the tested GBS isolates. Thus, it was estimated that dominant clones recovered from infants were CPS III/ST17 in late-onset infections (19/23; 82.6%), and Ia/ST23 in early-onset disease (44.4%). Conversely, genotype CPS V/ST1 was the most prevalent in adults (4/9; 25.4%). All isolates were susceptible to penicillin. Macrolide resistance (23.1%) was strongly associated with the ermB gene and constitutive resistance to clindamycin (63.9%). The majority of strains was resistant to tetracycline (86.6%), mostly mediated by the tetM gene (87.7%). GBS isolates of CPS V/ST1 and CPS III/ST23 were significantly associated with macrolide and tetracycline resistance, respectively. In conclusion, hyper-virulent CPS III/ST17 and V/ST1 were recognized as dominant GBS clones in this study.	I Gajic|C Plainvert|D Kekic|N Dmytruk|V Mijac|A Tazi|P Glaser|L Ranin|C Poyart|N Opavski
30388811	The CRISPR-Cas system biologically serves as an adaptive defense mechanism against phages. However, there is growing interest in exploiting the hypervariable nature of the CRISPR locus, often of viral origin, for microbial typing and tracking. Moreover, the spacer content of any given strain provides a phage resistance profile. Large-scale CRISPR typing studies require an efficient method for showcasing CRISPR array similarities across multiple isolates. Historically, CRISPR arrays found in microbes have been represented by colored shapes based on nucleotide sequence identity and, while this approach is now routinely used, only scarce computational resources are available to automate the process, making it very time-consuming for large datasets. To alleviate this tedious task, we introduce CRISPRStudio, a command-line tool developed to accelerate CRISPR analysis and standardize the preparation of CRISPR array figures. It first compares nucleotide spacer sequences present in a dataset and then clusters them based on sequence similarity to assign a meaningful representative color. CRISPRStudio offers versatility to suit different biological contexts by including options such as automatic sorting of CRISPR loci and highlighting of shared spacers, while remaining fast and user-friendly.

30387552	Since the discovery that nucleases of the bacterial CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeat)-associated (Cas) system can be used as easily programmable tools for genome engineering, their application massively transformed different areas of plant biology. In this review, we assess the current state of their use for crop breeding to incorporate attractive new agronomical traits into specific cultivars of various crop plants. This can be achieved by the use of Cas9/12 nucleases for double-strand break induction, resulting in mutations by non-homologous recombination. Strategies for performing such experiments - from the design of guide RNA to the use of different transformation technologies - are evaluated. Furthermore, we sum up recent developments regarding the use of nuclease-deficient Cas9/12 proteins, as DNA-binding moieties for targeting different kinds of enzyme activities to specific sites within the genome. Progress in base deamination, transcriptional induction and transcriptional repression, as well as in imaging in plants, is also discussed. As different Cas9/12 enzymes are at hand, the simultaneous application of various enzyme activities, to multiple genomic sites, is now in reach to redirect plant metabolism in a multifunctional manner and pave the way for a new level of plant synthetic biology.

30379597	The ability to efficiently modify the genome using CRISPR technology has rapidly revolutionized biology and genetics and will soon transform medicine. Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) represents one of the first monogenic disorders that has been investigated with respect to CRISPR-mediated correction of causal genetic mutations. DMD results from mutations in the gene encoding dystrophin, a scaffolding protein that maintains the integrity of striated muscles. Thousands of different dystrophin mutations have been identified in DMD patients, who suffer from a loss of ambulation followed by respiratory insufficiency, heart failure, and death by the third decade of life. Using CRISPR to bypass DMD mutations, dystrophin expression has been efficiently restored in human cells and mouse models of DMD. Here, we review recent progress toward the development of possible CRISPR therapies for DMD and highlight opportunities and potential obstacles in attaining this goal.	YL Min|R Bassel-Duby|EN Olson

30373513	Dickeya sp. strain PA1 is the causal agent of bacterial soft rot in Phalaenopsis, an important indoor orchid in China. PA1 and a few other strains were grouped into a novel species, Dickeya fangzhongdai, and only the orchid-associated strains have been shown to cause soft rot symptoms.	We constructed the complete PA1 genome sequence and used comparative genomics to explore the differences in genomic features between D. fangzhongdai and other Dickeya species.	PA1 has a 4,979,223-bp circular genome with 4269 predicted protein-coding genes. D. fangzhongdai was phylogenetically similar to Dickeya solani and Dickeya dadantii. The type I to type VI secretion systems (T1SS-T6SS), except for the stt-type T2SS, were identified in D. fangzhongdai. The three phylogenetically similar species varied significantly in terms of their T5SSs and T6SSs, as did the different D. fangzhongdai strains. Genomic island (GI) prediction and synteny analysis (compared to D. fangzhongdai strains) of PA1 also indicated the presence of T5SSs and T6SSs in strain-specific regions. Two typical CRISPR arrays were identified in D. fangzhongdai and in most other Dickeya species, except for D. solani. CRISPR-1 was present in all of these Dickeya species, while the presence of CRISPR-2 varied due to species differentiation. A large polyketide/nonribosomal peptide (PK/NRP) cluster, similar to the zeamine biosynthetic gene cluster in Dickeya zeae rice strains, was discovered in D. fangzhongdai and D. solani. The D. fangzhongdai and D. solani strains might recently have acquired this gene cluster by horizontal gene transfer (HGT).	Orchid-associated strains are the typical members of D. fangzhongdai. Genomic analysis of PA1 suggested that this strain presents the genomic characteristics of this novel species. Considering the absence of the stt-type T2SS, the presence of CRISPR loci and the zeamine biosynthetic gene cluster, D. fangzhongdai is likely a transitional form between D. dadantii and D. solani. This is supported by the later acquisition of the zeamine cluster and the loss of CRISPR arrays by D. solani. Comparisons of phylogenetic positions and virulence determinants could be helpful for the effective quarantine and control of this emerging species.

30371314	Background The sodium channel, Nav1.5, encoded by SCN 5A, undergoes developmentally regulated splicing from inclusion of exon 6A in the fetal heart to exon 6B in adults. These mutually exclusive exons differ in 7 amino acids altering the electrophysiological properties of the Nav1.5 channel. In myotonic dystrophy type 1, SCN 5A is mis-spliced such that the fetal pattern of exon 6A inclusion is detected in adult hearts. Cardiac manifestations of myotonic dystrophy type 1 include conduction defects and arrhythmias and are the second-leading cause of death. Methods and Results This work aimed to determine the impact of SCN 5A mis-splicing on cardiac function. We used clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) /CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) to delete Scn5a exon 6B in mice, thereby redirecting splicing toward exon 6A. These mice exhibit prolonged PR and QRS intervals, slowed conduction velocity, extended action potential duration, and are highly susceptible to arrhythmias. Conclusions Our findings highlight a nonmutational pathological mechanism of arrhythmias and conduction defects as a result of mis-splicing of the predominant cardiac sodium channel. Animals homozygous for the deleted exon express only the fetal isoform and have more-severe phenotypes than heterozygotes that also express the adult isoform. This observation is directly relevant to myotonic dystrophy type 1, and possibly pathological arrhythmias, in which individuals differ with regard to the ratios of the isoforms expressed.

30370448	Cysteine-RIch Secretory Proteins (CRISPs) constitute a versatile family, with functions in reptilian venom and mammalian reproduction. Mammals generally express three CRISPs, four in mice, and all are highly expressed in male reproductive tissues, either testis or accessory organs. Because reproductive proteins often evolve adaptively in response to post-copulatory sexual selection, we hypothesized that mammalian CRISPs, with important roles in male reproduction, could have undergone positive selection promoting their divergence. We explored the molecular adaptation of mammalian CRISPs applying phylogenetic methods. Our analyses revealed the evidence of positive selection in all mammalian CRISPs. The intensity of positive selection was heterogeneous among CRISP members, being stronger in CRISP3 than in CRISP1 and CRISP2, and also across functional domains, having stronger impact on Pathogenesis-Related 1 (PR-1) in CRISP2 and on Ion Channel Regulator (ICR) in CRISP1 and CRISP3. In addition, we discovered a new CRISP in some rodent species, suggesting that the acquisition of new CRISP components could contribute to male reproductive success or to acquire new physiological roles. Signatures of positive selection were not focused on any particular mammalian group, suggesting that adaptive evolution is a recurrent pattern in mammalian CRISPs. Our findings support a model of CRISP family diversification driven by episodes of duplication and posterior neofunctionalization, and provide potential adaptive changes responsible for interspecific differences in CRISPs activity.

30369533	Multicentric carpotarsal osteolysis (MCTO) is a condition involving progressive osteolysis of the carpal and tarsal bones that is associated with glomerular sclerosis and renal failure (MCTO nephropathy). Previous work identified an autosomal dominant missense mutation in the transactivation domain of the transcription factor MAFB as the cause of MCTO. Several methods are currently used for MCTO nephropathy treatment, but these methods are invasive and lead to severe side effects, limiting their use. Therefore, the development of alternative treatments for MCTO nephropathy is required; however, the pathogenesis of MCTO in vivo is unclear without access to a mouse model. Here, we report the generation of an MCTO mouse model using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. These mice exhibit nephropathy symptoms that are similar to those observed in MCTO patients. MafbMCTO/MCTO mice show developmental defects in body weight from postnatal day 0, which persist as they age. They also exhibit high urine albumin creatinine levels from a young age, mimicking the nephropathic symptoms of MCTO patients. Characteristics of glomerular sclerosis reported in human patients are also observed, such as histological evidence of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), podocyte foot process microvillus transformation and podocyte foot process effacement. Therefore, this study contributes to the development of an alternative treatment for MCTO nephropathy by providing a viable mouse model.

30368976	Recently, we established the GEEP ("gene editing by electroporation of Cas9 protein") method, in which the CRISPR/Cas9 system, consisting of a Cas9 protein and single guide RNA (sgRNA), is introduced into pig zygotes by electroporation and thus induces highly efficient targeted gene disruption. In this study, we examined the effects of sgRNA on the blastocyst formation of porcine embryos and evaluated their genome-editing efficiency. To produce an animal model for diabetes, we targeted PDX-1 (pancreas duodenum homeobox 1), a gene that is crucial for pancreas development during the fetal period and whose monoallelic disruption impairs insulin secretion. First, Cas9 protein with different sgRNAs that targeted distinct sites in the PDX-1 exon 1 was introduced into in vitro-fertilized zygotes by the GEEP method. Of the six sgRNAs tested, three sgRNAs (sgRNA1, 2, and 3) successfully modified PDX-1 gene. The blastocyst formation rate of zygotes edited with sgRNA3 was significantly (p < 0.05) lower than that of control zygotes without the electroporation treatment. Our study indicates that the GEEP method can be successfully used to generate PDX-1 mutant blastocysts, but the development and the efficiency of editing the genome of zygotes may be affected by the sgRNA used for CRISPR/Cas9 system.

30367000	While filamentous cyanobacteria play a crucial role in food web dynamics and biogeochemical cycling of many aquatic ecosystems around the globe, the knowledge regarding the phages infecting them is limited. Here, we describe the complete genome of the virulent cyanophage vB_AphaS-CL131 (here, CL 131), a Siphoviridae phage that infects the filamentous diazotrophic bloom-forming cyanobacterium Aphanizomenon flos-aquae in the brackish Baltic Sea. CL 131 features a 112,793-bp double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) genome encompassing 149 putative open reading frames (ORFs), of which the majority (86%) lack sequence homology to genes with known functions in other bacteriophages or bacteria. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that CL 131 possibly represents a new evolutionary lineage within the group of cyanophages infecting filamentous cyanobacteria, which form a separate cluster from phages infecting unicellular cyanobacteria. CL 131 encodes a putative type V-U2 CRISPR-Cas system with one spacer (out of 10) targeting a DNA primase pseudogene in a cyanobacterium and a putative type II toxin-antitoxin system, consisting of a GNAT family N-acetyltransferase and a protein of unknown function containing the PRK09726 domain (characteristic of HipB antitoxins). Comparison of CL 131 proteins to reads from Baltic Sea and other available fresh- and brackish-water metagenomes and analysis of CRISPR-Cas arrays in publicly available A. flos-aquae genomes demonstrated that phages similar to CL 131 are present and dynamic in the Baltic Sea and share a common history with their hosts dating back at least several decades. In addition, different CRISPR-Cas systems within individual A. flos-aquae genomes targeted several sequences in the CL 131 genome, including genes related to virion structure and morphogenesis. Altogether, these findings revealed new genomic information for exploring viral diversity and provide a model system for investigation of virus-host interactions in filamentous cyanobacteria.IMPORTANCE The genomic characterization of novel cyanophage vB_AphaS-CL131 and the analysis of its genomic features in the context of other viruses, metagenomic data, and host CRISPR-Cas systems contribute toward a better understanding of aquatic viral diversity and distribution in general and of brackish-water cyanophages infecting filamentous diazotrophic cyanobacteria in the Baltic Sea in particular. The results of this study revealed previously undescribed features of cyanophage genomes (e.g., self-excising intein-containing putative dCTP deaminase and putative cyanophage-encoded CRISPR-Cas and toxin-antitoxin systems) and can therefore be used to predict potential interactions between bloom-forming cyanobacteria and their cyanophages.

30365048	Forkhead box L2 (FOXL2), a member of the forkhead family of transcription factors, is important in eyelid and ovary differentiation. Although the function of FOXL2 in organogenesis has been investigated, the detailed mechanisms by which FOXL2 mediates cellular process remain to be fully elucidated. Few FOXL2‑knockout cell lines have been reported, which has limited molecular mechanism investigations. CRISPR is a novel gene editing technique that has been widely used in human genetic diseases. In the present study, FOXL2 was disrupted using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR), and screening of a stable knockout cell line was performed in human ovarian granulosa KGN cells. Three sites (F404, F425 and F446) around the ATG start codon on the FOXL2 DNA sequence were constructed in a guide RNA lentivirus. Targeting F425 was most efficient, and western blot analysis and DNA sequencing of the resulting cells suggested that both FOXL2 alleles were fully disrupted. In addition, flow cytometry results indicated that the knockout of FOXL2 restricted cell cycle progression at the G0/G1 phase. In addition, the expression levels of cell cycle mediators cyclin D1 and cyclin‑dependent kinase 4 were reduced. These results confirmed that FOXL2 disruption in KGN cells is associated with the cell cycle attenuation.	B Tang|Y Zhang|W Zhang|Y Zhu|S Yuan
30362544	The targeted genome modification using RNA-guided nucleases is associated with several advantages such as a rapid, easy, and efficient method that not only provides the manipulation and alteration of genes and functional studies for researchers, but also increases their awareness of the molecular basis of the disease and development of new and targeted therapeutic approaches. Different techniques have been emerged so far as the molecular scissors mediating targeted genome editing including zinc finger nuclease, transcription activator-like effector nucleases, and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9). CRISPR-Cas9 is a bacterial immune system against viruses in which the single-strand RNA-guided Cas9 nuclease is linked to the targeted complementary sequences to apply changes. The advances made in the transfer, modification, and emergence of specific solutions have led to the creation of different classes of CRISPR-Cas9. Since this robust tool is capable of direct correction of disease-causing mutations, its ability to treat genetic disorders has attracted the tremendous attention of researchers. Considering the reported cases of nonspecific targeting of Cas9 proteins, many studies focused on enhancing the Cas9 features. In this regard, significant advances have been made in choosing guide RNA, new enzymes and methods for identifying misplaced targeting. Here, we highlighted the history and various direct aspects of CRISPR-Cas9, such as precision in genomic targeting, system transfer and its control over correction events with its applications in future biological studies, and modern treatment of diseases.

30361535	During invasion, Entamoeba histolytica (Eh) encounter macrophages and activate them to elicit tissue damaging pro-inflammatory responses. When Eh binds macrophages via the Gal-lectin, surface EhCP-A5 RGD sequence ligates α5β1 integrin to activate caspase-1 in a complex known as the NLRP3 inflammasome. In this study, we investigated Eh requirements underlying macrophage caspase-4 and -1 activation and the role caspase-4 and gasdermin D (GSDMD) play in augmenting pro-inflammatory cytokine responses. Caspase-4 activation was similar to caspase-1 requiring live Eh attachment via the Gal-lectin and EhCP-A5. However, unlike caspase-1, caspase-4 activation was independent of ASC and NLRP3. Using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing of caspase-4 and -1 and GSDMD, we determined that caspase-1 and bioactive IL-1β release was highly dependent on caspase-4 activation and cleavage of GSDMD in response to Eh. Formaldehyde cross-linking to stabilize protein-protein interactions in transfected COS-7 cells stimulated with Eh revealed that caspase-4 specifically interacted with caspase-1 in a protein complex that enhanced the cleavage of caspase-1 CARD domains to augment IL-1β release. Activated caspase-4 and -1 cleaved GSDMD liberating the N-terminal p30 pore-forming fragment that caused the secretion of IL-1β. These findings reveal a novel role for caspase-4 as a sensor molecule to amplify pro-inflammatory responses when macrophage encounters Eh.	J Quach|F Moreau|C Sandall|K Chadee
30357560	The bioethical principle of autonomy is problematic regarding the future of the embryo who lacks the ability to self-advocate but will develop this defining human capacity in time. Recent experiments explore the use of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 for germline engineering in the embryo, which alters future generations. The embryo's inability to express an autonomous decision is an obvious bioethical challenge of germline engineering. The philosopher Joel Feinberg acknowledged that autonomy is developing in children. He advocated that to reserve this future autonomy, parents should be guided to make ethical decisions that provide children with open futures. Here, Feinberg's 1980 open future theory is extended to the human embryo in the context of CRISPR germline engineering. Although the embryo does not possess the autonomous decision-making capacity at the time of germline engineering, the parental decision to permanently change the unique genetic fabric of the embryo and subsequent generations disregards future autonomy. Therefore, germline engineering in many instances is objectionable considering Feinberg's open future theory.	RL Mintz|JD Loike|RL Fischbach
30357503	In our previous work, a two-plasmid CRISPR/Cas9 system was constructed for genome editing in Corynebacterium glutamicum. To increase the transformation efficiency and simplify the plasmid curing steps, an all-in-one CRISPR/Cas9 system was constructed for efficient genome editing. In addition, to research proteolysis during the production of recombinant proteins and generate a host for enhanced expression of recombinant proteins, the system was used to delete three genes, clpC, porB, and mepA in C. glutamicum CGMCC1.15647, which encoded the Clp protease subunit ClpC, anion selective channel protein B, and metallopeptidase A, respectively. After the evaluation of different plasmids and hosts, small ubiquitin-like modifier-N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (SUMO-NT-proBNP), an important protein used for the diagnosis of mild heart failure was successfully expressed in the triple mutant ΔclpCΔporBΔmepA, which exhibit threefold higher levels of protein expression compared with the wild-type. In conclusion, we created a simplified CRISPR tool for genome editing in C. glutamicum, provided a method to generate a host for enhanced expression of recombinant proteins and successfully expressed SUMO-NT-proBNP in C. glutamicum. This tool and method will greatly facilitate genetic engineering and metabolic optimization of this important platform organism.	F Peng|X Liu|X Wang|J Chen|M Liu|Y Yang|Z Bai
30357478	Vibrio parahaemolyticus, a ubiquitous bacterium of the marine environment is an important food-borne pathogen responsible for gastroenteritis worldwide. In this study, we aimed to investigate the occurrence and diversity of the CRISPR-Cas system in V. parahaemolyticus genomes using a bioinformatics approach. The CRISPR-Cas system functions as an adaptive immune system in prokaryotes that provides immunity against foreign genetic elements. In total, 570 genomes V. parahaemolyticus genomes were analyzed of which 200 confirmed for the presence of CRISPR-Cas system. The CRISPR-Cas loci were further analyzed for their repeats, spacers and associated Cas proteins. Among the 200 V. parahaemolyticus strains analyzed, 16 (8%) strains possessed the CRISPR-Cas system of complete subtype I-F, while the remaining 184 (92%) harbored the minimalistic type, a subtype I-F variant. Orphan CRISPR repeats and Cas genes were found in one strain each. The CRISPR-associated direct repeat had an unit length of 28 bases. The number of repeat units in each array ranged from 3 to 5 or 5-41 depending on whether they belonged to the minimalistic or complete subtype-IF CRISPR-Cas system, respectively. Of the 768 spacers analyzed in this study, 295 were found to be unique to V. parahaemolyticus. Homology analysis of the conserved spacers revealed matches to plasmids, phages and gut viruses and self chromosomes. Among the CRISPR-associated proteins, Cas5 and Cas7 proteins were found to be conserved. However, variations were seen in the Cas6 protein, which could be grouped into four different types based on their protein length as well as amino acid composition. We present here the diversity and main features of the CRISPR-Cas system in V. parahaemolyticus, which could provide valuable insights in elucidating the role and mechanism of CRISPR/Cas elements in this pathogen.

30354846	Precise and efficient genetic manipulations have enabled researchers to understand gene functions in disease and development, providing a platform to search for molecular cures. Over the past decade, the unprecedented advancement of genome editing techniques has revolutionized the biological research fields. Early genome editing strategies involved many naturally occurring nucleases, including meganucleases, zinc finger nucleases, and transcription activator-like effector-based nucleases. More recently, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) / CRISPR-associated nucleases (CRISPR/Cas) system has greatly enriched genetic manipulation methods in conducting research. Those nucleases generate double-strand breaks in the target gene sequences and then utilize DNA repair mechanisms to permit precise yet versatile genetic manipulations. The oral and craniofacial field harbors a plethora of diseases and developmental defects that require genetic models that can exploit these genome editing techniques. This review provides an overview of the genome editing techniques, particularly the CRISPR/Cas9 technique, for the oral and craniofacial research community. We also discuss the details about the emerging applications of genome editing in oral and craniofacial biology.	N Yu|J Yang|Y Mishina|WV Giannobile
30354811	G-protein-coupled estrogen receptor, Gper1, has been implicated in cardiovascular disease, but its mechanistic role in blood pressure control is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that genetically salt-sensitive hypertensive rats with complete genomic excision of Gper1 by a multiplexed guide RNA CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats)/Cas9 (CRISPR associated proteins) approach present with lower blood pressure, which was accompanied by altered microbiota, different levels of circulating short chain fatty acids, and improved vascular relaxation. Microbiotal transplantation from hypertensive Gper1+/+ rats reversed the cardiovascular protective effect exerted by the genomic deletion of Gper1. Thus, this study reveals a role for Gper1 in promoting microbiotal alterations that contribute to cardiovascular pathology. However, the exact mechanism by which Gper1 regulates blood pressure is still unknown. Our results indicate that the function of Gper1 is contextually dependent on the microbiome, whereby, contemplation of using Gper1 as a target for therapy of cardiovascular disease requires caution.

30353175	Lineage relationships among the large number of heterogeneous cell types generated during development are difficult to reconstruct in a high-throughput manner. We recently established a method, scGESTALT, that combines cumulative editing of a lineage barcode array by CRISPR-Cas9 with large-scale transcriptional profiling using droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). The technique generates edits in the barcode array over multiple timepoints using Cas9 and pools of single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) introduced during early and late zebrafish embryonic development, which distinguishes it from similar Cas9 lineage-tracing methods. The recorded lineages are captured, along with thousands of cellular transcriptomes, to build lineage trees with hundreds of branches representing relationships among profiled cell types. Here, we provide details for (i) generating transgenic zebrafish; (ii) performing multi-timepoint barcode editing; (iii) building scRNA-seq libraries from brain tissue; and (iv) concurrently amplifying lineage barcodes from captured single cells. Generating transgenic lines takes 6 months, and performing barcode editing and generating single-cell libraries involve 7 d of hands-on time. scGESTALT provides a scalable platform to map lineage relationships between cell types in any system that permits genome editing during development, regeneration, or disease.

30352704	Applications of CRISPR in human health and in gene drives are at the forefront of biological research as tools. This technology will affect humankind and our environment, so as this technology pushes forward, the design and implementation of safety measures is imperative.

Here, we review environmental and health-related safety concerns associated with using CRISPR and ways proposed to minimize risk.	M Pineda|A Lear|JP Collins|S Kiani
30352599	Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) is a key cytosolic receptor of the innate immune system. Seneca valley virus (SVV) is a newly emerging RNA virus that infects pigs causing significant economic losses in pig industry. RIG-I plays different roles during different viruses infections. The role of RIG-I in SVV-infected cells remains unknown. Understanding of the role of RIG-I during SVV infection will help to clarify the infection process of SVV in the infected cells.	In this study, we generated a RIG-I knockout (KO) porcine kidney PK-15 cell line using the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein-9 nuclease (Cas9) genome editing tool. The RIG-I gene sequence of RIG-I KO cells were determined by Sanger sequencing method, and the expression of RIG-I protein in the RIG-I KO cells were detected by Western bloting. The activation status of type I interferon pathway in Sendai virus (SeV)- or SVV-infected RIG-I KO cells was investigated by measuring the mRNA expression levels of interferon (IFN)-β and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). The replicative state of SVV in the RIG-I KO cells was evaluated by qPCR, Western bloting, TCID50 assay and indirect immunofluorescence assay.	Gene editing of RIG-I in PK-15 cells successfully resulted in the destruction of RIG-I expression. RIG-I KO PK-15 cells had a lower expression of IFN-β and ISGs compared with wildtype (WT) PK-15 cells when stimulated by the model RNA virus SeV. The amounts of viral RNA and viral protein as well as viral yields in SVV-infected RIG-I WT and KO cells were determined and compared, which showed that knockout of RIG-I significantly increased SVV replication and propagation. Meanwhile, the expression of IFN-β and ISGs were considerably decreased in RIG-I KO cells compared with that in RIG-I WT cells during SVV infection.	Altogether, this study indicated that RIG-I showed an antiviral role against SVV and was essential for activation of type I IFN signaling during SVV infection. In addition, this study suggested that the CRISPR/Cas9 system can be used as an effective tool to modify cell lines to increase viral yields during SVV vaccine development.

30346403	The outlined protocol describes streamlined methods for the efficient and cost-effective generation of Cas9-associated guide RNAs. Two alternative strategies for guide RNA (gRNA) cloning are outlined based on the usage of the Type IIS restriction enzyme BsmBI in combination with a set of compatible vectors. Outside of the access to Sanger sequencing services to validate the generated vectors, no special equipment or reagents are required aside from those that are standard to modern molecular biology laboratories. The outlined method is primarily intended for cloning one single gRNA or one paired gRNA-expressing vector at a time. This procedure does not scale well for the generation of libraries containing thousands of gRNAs. For those purposes, alternative sources of oligonucleotide synthesis such as oligo-chip synthesis are recommended. Finally, while this protocol focuses on a set of mammalian vectors, the general strategy is plastic and is applicable to any organism if the appropriate gRNA vector is available.

30344094	Prokaryotic CRISPR-Cas systems provide adaptive immunity by integrating portions of foreign nucleic acids (spacers) into genomic CRISPR arrays. Cas6 proteins then process CRISPR array transcripts into spacer-derived RNAs (CRISPR RNAs; crRNAs) that target Cas nucleases to matching invaders. We find that a Marinomonas mediterranea fusion protein combines three enzymatic domains (Cas6, reverse transcriptase [RT], and Cas1), which function in both crRNA biogenesis and spacer acquisition from RNA and DNA. We report a crystal structure of this divergent Cas6, identify amino acids required for Cas6 activity, show that the Cas6 domain is required for RT activity and RNA spacer acquisition, and demonstrate that CRISPR-repeat binding to Cas6 regulates RT activity. Co-evolution of putative interacting surfaces suggests a specific structural interaction between the Cas6 and RT domains, and phylogenetic analysis reveals repeated, stable association of free-standing Cas6s with CRISPR RTs in multiple microbial lineages, indicating that a functional interaction between these proteins preceded evolution of the fusion.

30341435	Circularization for in vitro reporting of cleavage effects by sequencing (CIRCLE-seq) is a sensitive and unbiased method for defining the genome-wide activity (on-target and off-target) of CRISPR-Cas9 nucleases by selective sequencing of nuclease-cleaved genomic DNA (gDNA). Here, we describe a detailed experimental and analytical protocol for CIRCLE-seq. The principle of our method is to generate a library of circularized gDNA with minimized numbers of free ends. Highly purified gDNA circles are treated with CRISPR-Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes, and nuclease-linearized DNA fragments are then ligated to adapters for high-throughput sequencing. The primary advantages of CIRCLE-seq as compared with other in vitro methods for defining genome-wide genome editing activity are (i) high enrichment for sequencing nuclease-cleaved gDNA/low background, enabling sensitive detection with low sequencing depth requirements; and (ii) the fact that paired-end reads can contain complete information on individual nuclease cleavage sites, enabling use of CIRCLE-seq in species without high-quality reference genomes. The entire protocol can be completed in 2 weeks, including time for gRNA cloning, sequence verification, in vitro transcription, library preparation, and sequencing.

30334860	Müller cells, as the predominant glial element in the sensory retina, play a crucial role in healthy and diseased retina. Overactivation of Müller cells in response to damage is detrimental to the retina tissue. Current research shows that inhibiting glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a sensitive indicator of Müller cell activation, attenuated glial reactions and promoted neuroprotection. Recent evidence suggests that the transcript factor SOX9 (sex-determining region Y box 9), part of the SOX family, regulates GFAP expression of astrocytes in the central nervous system. However, in retina Müller cells, it is still unknown whether GFAP can be downregulated by reduced SOX9 function. The present results show that clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/Cas9-mediated SOX9 knockout not only inhibited GFAP expression in rat Müller cells but also attenuated cell migration ability. These results suggest that inhibition of SOX9 activity may be a novel therapeutic strategy for reduction of glial cell activity.	X Wang|Q Shu|Y Ni|G Xu
30334472	Single-cell analysis overcomes the problems of cellular heterogeneity by revealing the individual differences between cells in tissue. The current tools used to profile gene expression at the single-cell level are arduous and often require specialized equipment. We have previously developed a technique to quantify protein expression levels in single living cells. Here, we combine quantification of protein expression with absolute measurement of mRNA amounts of the same gene in the same cell, to profile the expression of genes at the transcriptional and translational levels. We show that high heterogeneity exists at both the mRNA and protein levels for multiple genes, even among monoclonal cells. We demonstrate a rapid, straightforward approach to single-cell profiling of RNA and protein production.	I Kays|BE Chen
30333485	Here we report Digital RNA with pertUrbation of Genes (DRUG-seq), a high-throughput platform for drug discovery. Pharmaceutical discovery relies on high-throughput screening, yet current platforms have limited readouts. RNA-seq is a powerful tool to investigate drug effects using transcriptome changes as a proxy, yet standard library construction is costly. DRUG-seq captures transcriptional changes detected in standard RNA-seq at 1/100th the cost. In proof-of-concept experiments profiling 433 compounds across 8 doses, transcription profiles generated from DRUG-seq successfully grouped compounds into functional clusters by mechanism of actions (MoAs) based on their intended targets. Perturbation differences reflected in transcriptome changes were detected for compounds engaging the same target, demonstrating the value of using DRUG-seq for understanding on and off-target activities. We demonstrate DRUG-seq captures common mechanisms, as well as differences between compound treatment and CRISPR on the same target. DRUG-seq provides a powerful tool for comprehensive transcriptome readout in a high-throughput screening environment.

30333044	In previous studies, CRISPR/Cas9 was shown to induce unexpected exon skipping; however, the mechanism by which this phenomenon is triggered is controversial. By analyzing 22 gene-edited rabbit lines generated using CRISPR/Cas9, we provide evidence of exon skipping at high frequency in premature termination codon-mutated rabbits but not in the rabbits with a premature termination codon mutation in exon 1 rabbits with non-frameshift or missense mutations. Our results suggest that CRISPR-mediated exon skipping depends on premature termination codon mutation-induced nonsense-associated altered splicing.	T Sui|Y Song|Z Liu|M Chen|J Deng|Y Xu|L Lai|Z Li
30327475	Early mammalian development entails transit through naive pluripotency towards post-implantation epiblast, which subsequently gives rise to primordial germ cells (PGC), the founding germline population. To investigate these cell fate transitions, we developed a compound-reporter to track cellular identity in a model of PGC specification (PGC-like cells; PGCLC), and coupled it with genome-wide CRISPR screening. We identify key genes both for exit from pluripotency and for acquisition of PGC fate, and characterise a central role for the transcription regulators Nr5a2 and Zfp296 in germline ontogeny. Abrogation of these genes results in widespread activation (Nr5a2-/-) or inhibition (Zfp296-/-) of WNT pathway factors in PGCLC. This leads to aberrant upregulation of the somatic programme or failure to activate germline genes, respectively, and consequently loss of germ cell identity. Our study places Zfp296 and Nr5a2 as key components of an expanded PGC gene regulatory network, and outlines a transferable strategy for identifying critical regulators of complex cell fate decisions.

30323222	Predicting the response and identifying additional targets that will improve the efficacy of chemotherapy is a major goal in cancer research. Through large-scale in vivo and in vitro CRISPR knockout screens in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells, we identified genes whose genetic deletion or pharmacologic inhibition synergistically increase the cytotoxicity of MEK signaling inhibitors. Furthermore, we show that CRISPR viability scores combined with basal gene expression levels could model global cellular responses to the drug treatment. We develop drug response evaluation by in vivo CRISPR screening (DREBIC) method and validated its efficacy using large-scale experimental data from independent experiments. Comparative analyses demonstrate that DREBIC predicts drug response in cancer cells from a wide range of tissues with high accuracy and identifies therapeutic vulnerabilities of cancer-causing mutations to MEK inhibitors in various cancer types.

30317623	Tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), a pivotal cytokine in sepsis, protects the host against pathogens by promoting an inflammatory response while simultaneously inducing apoptosis of the vascular endothelium. Unfortunately, inhibitors targeting certain components of the TNF-α signaling pathway to reduce cellular apoptosis have failed to translate into clinical applications, partly due to the adverse effects of excessive immunosuppression. In an attempt to discover potential targets in the TNF-α signaling pathway to modulate moderate inflammation and apoptosis during the development of sepsis, we performed a pooled genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screen in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 1A (TNFRSF1A), B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2), Bcl2-associated death promoter (BAD), and NLR family member X1 (NLRX1) deficiencies were identified as the effective genetic suppressors of TNF-α cytotoxicity on a list of candidate regulators. CRISPR-mediated NLRX1 knockout conferred cellular resistance to challenge with TNF-α, and NLRX1 could be induced to colocalize with mitochondria following TNF-α stimulation. Thus, our work demonstrates the advantage of genome-scale screening with Cas9 and validates NLRX1 as a potential modulator of TNF-α-induced vascular endothelial apoptosis during sepsis.

With the recent introduction of the powerful and relatively simple gene-editing tool CRISPR-Cas9, we have entered a new era in genetic engineering that will certainly lead to a variety of new transgenic models in the near future. The aim of this review is to note the most interesting avenues addressing unmet needs in neurodegenerative disease research that could provide promising targets for both the development of new models and the study of existing ones.

30312534	While nuclear actin was reported ~50 years ago, it's in vivo prevalence and structure remain largely unknown. Here, we use Drosophila oogenesis, that is, follicle development, to characterize nuclear actin. We find that three different reagents-DNase I, anti-actin C4, and anti-actin AC15-recognize distinct pools of nuclear actin. DNase I labels monomeric or G-actin, and, during follicle development, G-actin is present in the nucleus of every cell. Some G-actin is recognized by the C4 antibody. In particular, C4 nuclear actin colocalizes with DNase I to the nucleolus in anterior escort cells, follicle stem cells, some mitotic follicle cells, and a subset of nurse cells during early oogenesis. C4 also labels polymeric nuclear actin in the nucleoplasm of the germline stem cells, early cystoblasts, and oocytes. The AC15 antibody labels a completely distinct pool of nuclear actin from that of DNase I and C4. Specifically, AC15 nuclear actin localizes to the chromatin in the nurse and follicle cells during mid-to-late oogenesis. Within the oocyte, AC15 nuclear actin progresses from localizing to puncta surrounding the DNA, to forming a filamentous cage around the chromosomes. Together these findings reveal that nuclear actin is highly prevalent in vivo, and multiple pools of nuclear actin exist and can be recognized using different reagents. Additionally, our localization studies suggest that nuclear actin may regulate stemness, nucleolar structure and function, transcription, and nuclear structure. Such findings call for further studies to explore the prevalence, diversity, and functions of nuclear actin across tissues and organisms. Anat Rec, 301:2014-2036, 2018. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

30311729	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) are a revolutionary tool based on a bacterial acquired immune response system. CRISPR has gained widespread use for gene editing in a variety of organisms and is an increasingly valuable tool for basic genetic research, with far-reaching implications for medicine, agriculture, and industry. This lab is based on the premise that upper division undergraduate students enrolled in a Life Sciences curriculum must become familiar with cutting edge advances in biotechnology that have significant impact on society. Toward this goal, we developed a new hands-on laboratory exercise incorporating the use of CRISPR-Cas9 and homology directed repair (HDR) to edit two well-characterized genes in the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The two genes edited in this exercise, Adenine2 (ADE2) and Sterile12 (STE12) affect metabolic and developmental processes, respectively. Editing the premature stop codons in these genes results in clearly identifiable phenotypes that can be assessed by students in a standard laboratory course setting. Making use of this basic eukaryotic model organism facilitates a laboratory exercise that is inexpensive, simple to organize, set up, and present to students. This exercise enables undergraduate students to initiate and follow-up on all stages of the CRISPR gene editing process, from identification of guide RNAs, amplification of an appropriate HDR fragment, and analysis of mutant phenotypes. The organization of this protocol also allows for easy modification, providing additional options for editing any expressed genes within the yeast genome to produce new mutations, or recovery of existing mutants to wild type. © 2018 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 46(6):592-601, 2018.

30307447	Disorders of lipid and lipoprotein metabolism play a central role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Despite the widespread use of efficacious lipid-modifying therapies, the residual risk of CVD remains unacceptably high. The purpose of this manuscript is to review the application of new technologies in the treatment of lipid disorders. New therapies work mostly at the gene expression level and are, therefore, different from traditional small-molecule drugs that work mainly by inhibiting already synthesized proteins. We will briefly lay out the function of the gene products targeted by the new agents. Then, we will organize our review of new biotechnological treatments by the molecular approach, namely: monoclonal antibodies, antisense oligonucleotides, small-interfering RNAs, and Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated 9 (Cas9)-based genome editing. The paper concludes with the description of the current clinical studies and the perspectives for the use of these agents. (REV INVEST CLIN. 2018;70:244-54).	N Valencia-Enciso|CO Mendivil
30305350	Noroviruses (NoVs) are a leading cause of gastroenteritis worldwide, yet host factors that restrict NoV replication are not well understood. Here, we use a CRISPR activation genome-wide screening to identify host genes that can inhibit murine norovirus (MNoV) replication in human cells. Our screens identified with high confidence 49 genes that can inhibit MNoV infection when overexpressed. A significant number of these genes are in interferon and immune regulation signaling networks, but surprisingly, the majority of the genes identified are neither associated with innate or adaptive immunity nor associated with any antiviral activity. Confirmatory studies of eight of the genes validate the initial screening data. Mechanistic studies on TRIM7 demonstrated a conserved role of the molecule in mouse and human cells in restricting MNoV in a step of infection after viral entry. Furthermore, we demonstrate that two isoforms of TRIM7 have differential antiviral activity. Taken together, these data provide a resource for understanding norovirus biology and demonstrate a robust methodology for identifying new antiviral molecules.IMPORTANCE Norovirus is one of the leading causes of food-borne illness worldwide. Despite its prevalence, our understanding of norovirus biology is limited due to the difficulty in growing human norovirus in vitro and a lack of an animal model. Murine norovirus (MNoV) is a model norovirus system because MNoV replicates robustly in cell culture and in mice. To identify host genes that can restrict norovirus replication when overexpressed, we performed genome-wide CRISPR activation screens to induce gene overexpression at the native locus through recruitment of transcriptional activators to individual gene promoters. We found 49 genes that could block murine norovirus replication in human cells. Several of these genes are associated with classical immune signaling pathways, while many of the molecules we identified have not been previously associated with antiviral activity. Our data are a resource for those studying noroviruses, and we provide a robust approach to identify novel antiviral genes.	RC Orchard|ME Sullender|BF Dunlap|DR Balce|JG Doench|HW Virgin
30304510	Periodically repeating DNA and protein elements are involved in various important biological events including genomic evolution, gene regulation, protein complex formation, and immunity. Notably, the currently used genome editing tools such as ZFNs, TALENs, and CRISPRs are also all associated with periodically repeating biomolecules of natural organisms. Despite the biological importance of periodically repeating sequences and the expectation that new genome editing modules could be discovered from such periodical repeats, no software that globally detects such structured elements in large genomic resources in a high-throughput and unsupervised manner has been developed. We developed new software, SPADE (Search for Patterned DNA Elements), that exhaustively explores periodic DNA and protein repeats from large-scale genomic datasets based on k-mer periodicity evaluation. With a simple constraint, sequence periodicity, SPADE captured reported genome-editing-associated sequences and other protein families involving repeating domains such as tetratricopeptide, ankyrin and WD40 repeats with better performance than the other software designed for limited sets of repetitive biomolecular sequences, suggesting the high potential of this software to contribute to the discovery of new biological events and new genome editing modules.

30304253	The fidelity of the genomes is defended by mechanism known as Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) systems. Three Type II CRISPR systems (CRISPR1- cas, CRISPR2 and CRISPR3-cas) have been identified in enterococci isolates from clinical and environmental samples. The aim of this study was to observe the distribution of CRISPR1-cas, CRISPR2 and CRISPR3-cas in non-clinical strains of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium isolates from food and fecal samples, including wild marine animals. The presence of CRISPRs was evaluated by PCR in 120 enterococci strains, 67 E. faecalis and 53 E. faecium. It is the first report of the presence of the CRISPRs system in E. faecalis and E. faecium strains isolated from wild marine animal fecal samples. The results showed that in non-clinical strains, the CRISPRs were more frequently detected in E. faecalis than in E. faecium. And the frequencies of CRISPR1-cas and CRISPR2 were higher (60%) in E. faecalis strains isolated from animal feces, compared to food samples. Both strains showed low frequencies of CRISPR3-cas (8.95% and 1.88%). In conclusion, the differences in the habitats of enterococcal species may be related with the results observe in distribution of CRISPRs systems.

RNA is now perceived as not merely a passive carrier of DNA information but especially through its propensity to mutate as a computation engine of cell biology, developmental biology and evolution. Synthetic Gene drives have been hailed as a potential strategy to reduce climate-change-mediated biosecurity threats such as spreading malaria and have attracted significant investment, with the Gates Foundation pledging US$75 million and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency awarding US$65 million. Calls for a global moratorium on RNA-mediated genetic engineering may overstate the potential risks of the developing technology, but form a background to the contest between "process"- and "product" -based approaches to regulation, the former purportedly favoured by the public and regulatory agencies and the latter favoured by the broad scientific community and corporate investors. At stake may be the democratic legitimacy of and equitable access to a technology that could be important to reduce the incidence of biosecurity threats both globally and in Australia.

30301858	Several genome-wide screens have been conducted to identify host cell factors involved in the pathogenesis of bacterial pathogens whose virulence is dependent on type III secretion systems (T3SSs), nanomachines responsible for the translocation of proteins into host cells. In the most recent of these, Pacheco et al. (mBio 9:e01003-18, 2018, http://mbio.asm.org/content/9/3/e01003-18.full) screened a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats with Cas9) knockout library for host proteins involved in the pathogenesis of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC). Their study revealed an unrecognized link between EHEC's two major virulence determinants (its T3SS and Shiga toxins). We discuss these findings in light of data from three other genome-wide screens. Each of these studies uncovered multiple host cell determinants, which curiously share little to no overlap but primarily are involved in mediating early interactions between T3SSs and host cells. We therefore consider how each screen was performed, the advantages and disadvantages of each, and how follow-up studies might be designed to address these issues.	JP Lynch|CF Lesser
30301136	Hemophilia B (HB) is an X-linked recessive bleeding disorder, caused by F9 gene deficiency. Gene therapy combined with the CRISPR/Cas9 technology offers a potential cure for hemophilia B. Now the Cas9 nickase (Cas9n) shows a great advantage in reducing off-target effect compared with wild-type Cas9. In this study, we found that in the multicopy ribosomal DNA (rDNA) locus, the homology directed recombination (HDR) efficiency induced by sgRNA-Cas9n was much higher than sgRNA-Cas9, meanwhile without off-target in six predicted sites. After co-transfection into mESCs with sgRNA-Cas9n and a non-viral rDNA targeting vector pMrnF9, harboring the homology donor template and the human F9 expression cassette, a recombination efficiency of 66.7% was achieved and all targeted clones were confirmed to be site-specific integration of F9 in the rDNA locus by PCR and southern blotting. Targeted mESCs retained the main pluripotent properties and were then differentiated into hepatic progenitor like cells (HPLCs) and mature hepatocytes, which were characterized by hepatic markers and functional assays. Importantly, the differentiated cells could transcribe exogenous F9 and secrete coagulation factor IX (FIX) proteins, suggesting active transcription and stable inheritance of transgenes in the rDNA locus. After intrasplenical transplantation in severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) mice, targeted HPLCs could survive and migrate from spleen to liver, resulting in secretion of exogenous FIX into blood. In summary, we demonstrate an efficient and site-specific gene targeting strategy in rDNA locus for stem cell-based gene therapy for hemophilia B.

30296942	Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 100 loci associated with increased risk of prostate cancer, most of which are in non-coding regions of the genome. Understanding the function of these non-coding risk loci is critical to elucidate the genetic susceptibility to prostate cancer.	We generate genome-wide regulatory element maps and performed genome-wide chromosome confirmation capture assays (in situ Hi-C) in normal and tumorigenic prostate cells. Using this information, we annotate the regulatory potential of 2,181 fine-mapped prostate cancer risk-associated SNPs and predict a set of target genes that are regulated by prostate cancer risk-related H3K27Ac-mediated loops. We next identify prostate cancer risk-associated CTCF sites involved in long-range chromatin loops. We use CRISPR-mediated deletion to remove prostate cancer risk-associated CTCF anchor regions and the CTCF anchor regions looped to the prostate cancer risk-associated CTCF sites, and we observe up to 100-fold increases in expression of genes within the loops when the prostate cancer risk-associated CTCF anchor regions are deleted.	We identify GWAS risk loci involved in long-range loops that function to repress gene expression within chromatin loops. Our studies provide new insights into the genetic susceptibility to prostate cancer.	Y Guo|AA Perez|DJ Hazelett|GA Coetzee|SK Rhie|PJ Farnham
30296940	Pooled CRISPR screens allow researchers to interrogate genetic causes of complex phenotypes at the genome-wide scale and promise higher specificity and sensitivity compared to competing technologies. Unfortunately, two problems exist, particularly for CRISPRi/a screens: variability in guide efficiency and large rare off-target effects. We present a method, CRISPhieRmix, that resolves these issues by using a hierarchical mixture model with a broad-tailed null distribution. We show that CRISPhieRmix allows for more accurate and powerful inferences in large-scale pooled CRISPRi/a screens. We discuss key issues in the analysis and design of screens, particularly the number of guides needed for faithful full discovery.	TP Daley|Z Lin|X Lin|Y Liu|WH Wong|LS Qi
30295162	Bacteriophage can be an effective means of regulating bacterial populations when conditions allow phage invasion of bacterial colonies. Phage can either infect and lyse a host cell, or insert their DNA into the host cell genome; the latter process is called lysogeny. The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) system, linked with CRISPR-associated (Cas) genes, is a regulatory system present in a variety of bacteria which confers immunity against bacteriophage. Studies of the group behaviour of bacteria with CRISPR/Cas systems have provided evidence that CRISPR in lysogenized bacteria can cause an inability to form biofilm. This allows CRISPR-immune bacteria in biofilms to effectively resist phage therapy. Our recent work has described a potential therapeutic technique to eradicate CRISPR-immune bacteria from a biofilm by a continuous influx of lysogens carrying an identical phage sequence. However, this model predicted that the CRISPR-immune population could persist for long times before eradication. Our current focus is on the use of diverse lysogens against CRISPR-capable bacterial populations. The goal of this work is to find a suitable strategy which can eradicate bacteria with a CRISPR system through the influx of finite amounts of distinct lysogens over fixed intervals.	Q Ali
30293848	The majority of embryonic loss in cattle occurs within the first 3 to 4 wk of pregnancy, and there are currently no accurate predictors of pregnancy outcome. Existing embryo quality assessment methods include morphological evaluation and embryo biopsy. These methods are not accurate and carry some health risks to the developing embryo, respectively. Therefore, there is need to identify noninvasive biomarkers such as microRNA that can predict embryo quality and pregnancy outcome. Furthermore, researchers need a better understanding of the dynamic interaction between the mother and the embryo. The transcriptome of the uterus shows plasticity that depends on the embryo type so that the expression level of some genes for in vivo embryos would be different from that of in vitro-produced embryos. Similarly, the embryonic transcriptome and epigenome change in response to different environmental factors such as stress, diet, disease, and physiological status of the mother. This embryo-mother crosstalk could be better understood by investigating the molecular signaling that occurs at different stages of embryonic development. Although transcriptomics is a useful tool to assess the roles of genes and pathways in embryo quality and maternal receptivity, it does not provide the exact functions of these genes, and it shows correlation rather than causality. Therefore, an in-depth functional genomic analysis is needed for better understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling embryo development. In this review, we discuss recent genomic technologies such as RNA interference, gapmer technology, and genome editing techniques used in humans and livestock to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of genes affecting embryo development.

30293782	RNA splicing is a critical mechanism by which to modify transcriptome, and its dysregulation is the underlying cause of many human diseases. It remains challenging, however, to genetically modulate a splicing event in its native context. Here, we demonstrate that a CRISPR-guided cytidine deaminase (i.e., targeted-AID mediated mutagenesis [TAM]) can efficiently modulate various forms of mRNA splicing. By converting invariant guanines to adenines at either 5' or 3' splice sites (SS), TAM induces exon skipping, activation of alternative SS, switching between mutually exclusive exons, or targeted intron retention. Conversely, TAM promotes downstream exon inclusion by mutating cytidines into thymines at the polypyrimidine tract. Applying this approach, we genetically restored the open reading frame and dystrophin function of a mutant DMD gene in patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Thus, the CRISPR-guided cytidine deaminase provides a versatile genetic platform to modulate RNA splicing and to correct mutations associated with aberrant splicing in human diseases.

30286132	Migration and Invasion Enhancer (MIEN1) is an oncogene which is involved in facilitating motility of cancer cells through actin dynamics and gene expression. Increased MIEN1 expression in many types of tumors leads to disease progression and metastatic propensity. It is unclear precisely how MIEN1 is involved in this process and more studies are required to tease out the mechanisms. Here we show that Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeat (CRISPR) genome editing effectively produced specific genomic deletions in the MIEN1 gene which led to the abrogation of its expression in breast cancer cells. The single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) mediated targeting of MIEN1 was specific and none of the clones screened for off-target cleavage revealed any insertions or deletions (indels). Additionally, disruption of the MIEN1 gene did not alter the cell morphology, growth, proliferation or survival. Knocking out MIEN1 in these breast cancer cells will allow future studies to determine the exact role MIEN1 plays in breast tumor metastasis, which might lead to production of novel therapeutics to treat this and other cancers.

30285700	Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats/CRISPR associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) has been wildly used to generate gene knockout models through inducing indels causing frame-shift. However, there are few studies concerning the post-transcript effects caused by CRISPR-mediated genome editing.	In the present study, we showed that gene knockdown model also could be generated using CRISPR-mediated gene editing by disrupting the boundary of exon and intron in mice (C57BL/6 J). CRISPR induced indel at the boundary of exon and intron (5' splice site) caused alternative splicing and produced multiple different mRNAs, most of these mRNAs introduced premature termination codon causing down expression of the gene.	These results showed that alternative splicing mutants were able to generate through CRISPR-mediated genome editing by deleting the boundary of exon and intron causing disruption of 5' splice site. Although alternative splicing was an unexpected outcome, this finding could be developed as a technology to generate gene knockdown models or to investigate pre-mRNA splicing.

30285246	The CRISPR/Cas9 system, as a revolutionary genome editing tool for all areas of molecular biology, provides new opportunities for research on lncRNA's function. However, designing a CRISPR/Cas9 single guide RNA (sgRNA) for lncRNA is not easy with an unwarrantable effectiveness. Thus, it is worthy of collecting validated sgRNAs, to assist in efficiently choosing sgRNA with an expected activity. CRISPRlnc (http://www.crisprlnc.org or http://crisprlnc.xtbg.ac.cn) is a manually curated database of validated CRISPR/Cas9 sgRNAs for lncRNAs from all species. After manually reviewing more than 200 published literature, the current version of CRISPRlnc contains 305 lncRNAs and 2102 validated sgRNAs across eight species, including mammalian, insect and plant. We handled the ID, position in the genome, sequence and functional description of these lncRNAs, as well as the sequence, protoacceptor-motif (PAM), CRISPR type and validity of their paired sgRNAs. In CRISPRlnc, we provided the tools for browsing, searching and downloading data, as well as online BLAST service and genome browse server. As the first database against the validated sgRNAs of lncRNAs, CRISPRlnc will provide a new and powerful platform to promote CRISPR/Cas9 applications for future functional studies of lncRNAs.

30285096	Hexose transporter-deficient yeast strains are valuable testbeds for the study of sugar transport by native and heterologous transporters. In the popular Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain EBY.VW4000, deletion of 21 transporters completely abolished hexose transport. However, repeated use of the LoxP/Cre system in successive deletion rounds also resulted in major chromosomal rearrangements, gene loss and phenotypic changes. In the present study, CRISPR/SpCas9 was used to delete the 21 hexose transporters in an S. cerevisiae strain from the CEN.PK family in only three deletion rounds, using 11 unique guide RNAs. Even upon prolonged cultivation, the resulting strain IMX1812 (CRISPR-Hxt0) was unable to consume glucose, while its growth rate on maltose was the same as that of a strain equipped with a full set of hexose transporters. Karyotyping and whole-genome sequencing of the CRISPR-Hxt0 strain with Illumina and Oxford Nanopore technologies did not reveal chromosomal rearrangements or other unintended mutations besides a few SNPs. This study provides a new, 'genetically unaltered' hexose transporter-deficient strain and supplies a CRISPR toolkit for removing all hexose transporter genes from most S. cerevisiae laboratory strains in only three transformation rounds.

30283135	The ability to record transcriptional events within a cell over time would help to elucidate how molecular events give rise to complex cellular behaviours and states. However, current molecular recording technologies capture only a small set of defined stimuli. Here we use CRISPR spacer acquisition to capture and convert intracellular RNAs into DNA, enabling DNA-based storage of transcriptional information. In Escherichia coli, we show that defined stimuli, such as an RNA virus or arbitrary sequences, as well as complex stimuli, such as oxidative stress, result in quantifiable transcriptional records that are stored within a population of cells. We demonstrate that the transcriptional records enable us to classify and describe complex cellular behaviours and to identify the precise genes that orchestrate differential cellular responses. In the future, CRISPR spacer acquisition-mediated recording of RNA followed by deep sequencing (Record-seq) could be used to reconstruct transcriptional histories that describe complex cell behaviours or pathological states.

30278376	The human GLI3 protein has a dual function as a transcriptional activator or repressor of hedgehog signaling, depending on the proteolytic processing forms of GLI3. In this study, we established a compound heterozygous GLI3 mutant human embryonic stem cell line (WAe001-A-20) through CRISPR/Cas9 editing. The WAe001-A-20 cells carried two deletions on two different alleles of exon 2 of GLI3, respectively, which resulted in a frame shift and early termination in the translation of GLI3. Moreover, WAe001-A-20 maintains a normal karyotype, parental cell morphology, pluripotent phenotype and the ability to differentiate into three germ layers. Resource table.

30272647	Recent studies have clearly shown that long-range, three-dimensional chromatin looping interactions play a significant role in the regulation of gene expression, but whether looping is responsible for or a result of alterations in gene expression is still unknown. Until recently, how chromatin looping affects the regulation of gene activity and cellular function has been relatively ambiguous, and limitations in existing methods to manipulate these structures prevented in-depth exploration of these interactions. To resolve this uncertainty, we engineered a method for selective and reversible chromatin loop re-organization using CRISPR-dCas9 (CLOuD9). The dynamism of the CLOuD9 system has been demonstrated by successful localization of CLOuD9 constructs to target genomic loci to modulate local chromatin conformation. Importantly, the ability to reverse the induced contact and restore the endogenous chromatin conformation has also been confirmed. Modulation of gene expression with this method establishes the capacity to regulate cellular gene expression and underscores the great potential for applications of this technology in creating stable de novo chromatin loops that markedly affect gene expression in the contexts of cancer and development.

30270540	There are no effective treatments for corneal endothelial diseases, except for corneal transplantation, as human corneal endothelial cells (hCECs) do not regenerate. The regeneration of hCECs could be induced through regulation of the expression of specific genes. In this study, we investigated whether the overexpression of sex-determining region Y-box 2 (SOX2) can regenerate hCECs in vivo and in vitro. SOX2 was activated using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/deactivated CRISPR-associated protein 9 (dCas9) activation system. Genes were transfected into the corneal endothelium of Sprague-Dawley rats. Central corneal thickness and opacity were measured, and alizarin red S staining was performed. Corneal opacity and central corneal thickness were reduced in the SOX2 group compared with the control group. The density of CECs was higher in the SOX2 group compared with the control group. Additionally, hCECs were cultured and analyzed after overexpressing SOX2. Cell viability, proliferation rate, and the number of cells in S-phase were increased after SOX2 overexpression (p < .05). Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 and cyclin D1 were found to be overexpressed (p < .05). WNT signaling was repressed, and the AKT pathway was activated by SOX2 overexpression. Mitochondrial oxidative stress and energy production were increased by SOX2 overexpression (p < .05). In conclusion, SOX2 activation promotes wound healing and regeneration in CECs. SOX2 activation using the CRISPR/dCas9 system may thus be useful for the treatment of hCEC diseases. Stem Cells 2018;36:1851-12.	YK Chang|JS Hwang|TY Chung|YJ Shin
30269229	Genome editing using engineered nucleases has rapidly transformed from a niche technology to a mainstream method used in various host cells. Its widespread adoption has been largely developed by the emergence of the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) system, which uses an easily customizable specificity RNA-guided DNA endonuclease, such as Cas9. Recently, CRISPR/Cas9 mediated genome engineering has been widely applied to model organisms, including Bacillus subtilis, enabling facile, rapid high-fidelity modification of endogenous native genes. Here, we reviewed the recent progress in B. subtilis gene editing using CRISPR/Cas9 based tools, and highlighted state-of-the-art strategies for design of CRISPR/Cas9 system. Finally, future perspectives on the use of CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering for sequence-specific genome editing in B. subtilis are provided.	KQ Hong|DY Liu|T Chen|ZW Wang
30266728	Commercial probiotic bacteria must be tested for acquired antibiotic resistance elements to avoid potential transfer to pathogens. The European Food Safety Authority recommends testing resistance using microdilution culture techniques previously used to establish inhibitory thresholds for the Bifidobacterium genus. Many Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis strains exhibit increased resistance to tetracycline, historically attributed to the ribosomal protection gene tet(W). However, some strains that harbor genetically identical tet(W) genes show various inhibition levels, suggesting that other genetic elements also contribute to observed differences. Here, we adapted several molecular assays to confirm the inhibition of B. animalis subsp. lactis strains Bl-04 and HN019 and employed RNA sequencing to assess the transcriptional differences related to genomic polymorphisms. We detected specific stress responses to the antibiotic by correlating ATP concentration to number of viable genome copies from droplet digital PCR and found that the bacteria were still metabolically active in high drug concentrations. Transcriptional analyses revealed that several polymorphic regions, particularly a novel multidrug efflux transporter, were differentially expressed between the strains in each experimental condition, likely having phenotypic effects. We also found that the tet(W) gene was upregulated only during subinhibitory tetracycline concentrations, while two novel tetracycline resistance genes were upregulated at high concentrations. Furthermore, many genes involved in amino acid metabolism and transporter function were upregulated, while genes for complex carbohydrate utilization, protein metabolism, and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat(s) (CRISPR)-Cas systems were downregulated. These results provide high-throughput means for assessing antibiotic resistances of two highly related probiotic strains and determine the genetic network that contributes to the global tetracycline response.IMPORTANCEBifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis is widely used in human food and dietary supplements. Although well documented to be safe, B. animalis subsp. lactis strains must not contain transferable antibiotic resistance elements. Many B. animalis subsp. lactis strains have different resistance measurements despite being genetically similar, and the reasons for this are not well understood. In the current study, we sought to examine how genomic differences between two closely related industrial B. animalis subsp. lactis strains contribute to different resistance levels. This will lead to a better understanding of resistance, identify future targets for analysis of transferability, and expand our understanding of tetracycline resistance in bacteria.

30265865	CRISPR-based genome editing provides a simple and scalable toolbox for a variety of therapeutic and biotechnology applications. Whilst the fundamental properties of CRISPR proved easily transferable from the native prokaryotic hosts to eukaryotic and multicellular organisms, the tight control of the CRISPR-editing activity remains a major challenge. Here we summarise recent developments of CRISPR and riboswitch technologies and recommend novel functionalised synthetic-gRNA (sgRNA) designs to achieve inducible and spatiotemporal regulation of CRISPR-based genetic editors in response to cellular or extracellular stimuli. We believe that future advances of these tools will have major implications for both basic and applied research, spanning from fundamental genetic studies and synthetic biology to genetic editing and gene therapy.

30261908	Saccharomyces cerevisiae is used worldwide for the production of ale-type beers. This yeast is responsible for the production of the characteristic fruity aroma compounds. Esters constitute an important group of aroma active secondary metabolites produced by S. cerevisiae. Previous work suggests that esterase activity, which results in ester degradation, may be the key factor determining the abundance of fruity aroma compounds. Here, we test this hypothesis by deletion of two S. cerevisiae esterases, IAH1 and TIP1, using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing and by studying the effect of these deletions on esterase activity and extracellular ester pools.	Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants were constructed lacking esterase IAH1 and/or TIP1 using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing. Esterase activity using 5-(6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate (cFDA) as substrate was found to be significantly lower for ΔIAH1 and ΔIAH1ΔTIP1 mutants compared to wild type (WT) activity (P < 0.05 and P < 0.001, respectively). As expected, we observed an increase in relative abundance of acetate and ethyl esters and an increase in ethyl esters in ΔIAH1 and ΔTIP1, respectively. Interestingly, the double gene disruption mutant ΔIAH1ΔTIP1 showed an aroma profile comparable to WT levels, suggesting the existence and activation of a complex regulatory mechanism to compensate multiple genomic alterations in aroma metabolism.

30261168	CRISPR-Cas systems constitute the adaptive immune system of bacteria and archaea, as a sequence-specific nucleic acid targeting defense mechanism. The sequence-specific recognition and cleavage of Cas effector complexes has been harnessed to developed CRISPR-based technologies and drive the genome editing revolution underway, due to their efficacy, efficiency, and ease of implementation in a broad range of organisms. CRISPR-based technologies offer a wide variety of opportunities in genome remodeling and transcriptional regulation, opening new avenues for therapeutic and biotechnological applications. To repurpose CRISPR-Cas systems for these applications, the various elements of the system need to be first identified and functionally characterized in their native host. Bioinformatic tools are first used to identify putative CRISPR arrays and their associated genes, followed by a comprehensive characterization of the CRISPR-Cas system, encompassing predictions for guide and target sequences. Subsequently, interference assays and transcriptomic analyses should be performed to probe the functionality of the CRISPR-Cas system. Once an endogenous CRISPR-Cas system is characterized as functional, they can be readily repurposed by delivering an engineered synthetic CRISPR array or a small RNA guide for targeted gene manipulation. Alternatively, developing a plasmid-based system for heterologous expression of the necessary CRISPR components can enable exploitation in other organisms. Altogether, there is a wide diversity of native CRISPR-Cas systems in many bacteria and most archaea that await functional characterization and repurposing for genome editing applications in prokaryotes.

30252595	The Class 2 Type V-A CRISPR effector protein Cas12a/Cpf1 has gained widespread attention in part because of the ease in achieving multiplexed genome editing, gene regulation, and DNA detection. Multiplexing derives from the ability of Cas12a alone to generate multiple guide RNAs from a transcribed CRISPR array encoding alternating conserved repeats and targeting spacers. While array design has focused on how to optimize guide-RNA sequences, little attention has been paid to sequences outside of the CRISPR array. Here, we show that a structured hairpin located immediately downstream of the 3' repeat interferes with utilization of the adjacent encoded guide RNA by Francisella novicida (Fn)Cas12a. We first observed that a synthetic Rho-independent terminator immediately downstream of an array impaired DNA cleavage based on plasmid clearance in E. coli and DNA cleavage in a cell-free transcription-translation (TXTL) system. TXTL-based cleavage assays further revealed that inhibition was associated with incomplete processing of the transcribed CRISPR array and could be attributed to the stable hairpin formed by the terminator. We also found that the inhibitory effect partially extended to upstream spacers in a multi-spacer array. Finally, we found that removing the terminal repeat from the array increased the inhibitory effect, while replacing this repeat with an unprocessable terminal repeat from a native FnCas12a array restored cleavage activity directed by the adjacent encoded guide RNA. Our study thus revealed that sequences surrounding a CRISPR array can interfere with the function of a CRISPR nuclease, with implications for the design and evolution of CRISPR arrays.

30252062	Expression of a heterologous xylose isomerase, deletion of the GRE3 aldose-reductase gene and overexpression of genes encoding xylulokinase (XKS1) and non-oxidative pentose-phosphate-pathway enzymes (RKI1, RPE1, TAL1, TKL1) enables aerobic growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae on d-xylose. However, literature reports differ on whether anaerobic growth on d-xylose requires additional mutations. Here, CRISPR-Cas9-assisted reconstruction and physiological analysis confirmed an early report that this basic set of genetic modifications suffices to enable anaerobic growth on d-xylose in the CEN.PK genetic background. Strains that additionally carried overexpression cassettes for the transaldolase and transketolase paralogs NQM1 and TKL2 only exhibited anaerobic growth on d-xylose after a 7-10 day lag phase. This extended lag phase was eliminated by increasing inoculum concentrations from 0.02 to 0.2 g biomass L-1. Alternatively, a long lag phase could be prevented by sparging low-inoculum-density bioreactor cultures with a CO2/N2-mixture, thus mimicking initial CO2 concentrations in high-inoculum-density, nitrogen-sparged cultures, or by using l-aspartate instead of ammonium as nitrogen source. This study resolves apparent contradictions in the literature on the genetic interventions required for anaerobic growth of CEN.PK-derived strains on d-xylose. Additionally, it indicates the potential relevance of CO2 availability and anaplerotic carboxylation reactions for anaerobic growth of engineered S. cerevisiae strains on d-xylose.

30251319	Cylindrospermopsis (Raphidiopsis) raciborskii is an invasive, filamentous, nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium that forms frequent blooms in freshwater habitats. While viruses play key roles in regulating the abundance, production and diversity of their hosts in aquatic ecosystems, the role(s) of viruses in the ecology of C. raciborskii is almost unexplored. Progress in this field has been hindered by the absence of a characterized virus-host system in C. raciborskii. To bridge this gap, we sequenced the genome of CrV-01T, a previously isolated cyanosiphovirus, and its host, C. raciborskii strain Cr2010. Analyses suggest that CrV-01T represents a distinct clade of siphoviruses infecting, and perhaps lysogenizing, filamentous cyanobacteria. Its genome contains unique features that include an intact CRISPR array and a 12 kb inverted duplication. Evidence suggests CrV-01T recently gained the ability to infect Cr2010 and recently lost the ability to form lysogens. The cyanobacterial host contains a CRISPR-Cas system with CRISPR spacers matching protospacers within the inverted duplication of the CrV-01T genome. Examination of metagenomes demonstrates that viruses with high genetic identity to CrV-01T, but lacking the inverted duplication, are present in C. raciborskii blooms in Australia. The unique genomic features of the CrV/Cr2010 system offers opportunities to investigate in more detail virus-host interactions in an ecologically important bloom-forming cyanobacterium.

30247487	Staphylococcus aureus and other staphylococci continue to cause life-threatening infections in both hospital and community settings. They have become increasingly resistant to antibiotics, especially β-lactams and aminoglycosides, and their infections are now, in many cases, untreatable. Here we present a non-antibiotic, non-phage method of treating staphylococcal infections by engineering of the highly mobile staphylococcal pathogenicity islands (SaPIs). We replaced the SaPIs' toxin genes with antibacterial cargos to generate antibacterial drones (ABDs) that target the infecting bacteria in the animal host, express their cargo, kill or disarm the bacteria and thus abrogate the infection. Here we have constructed ABDs with either a CRISPR-Cas9 bactericidal or a CRISPR-dCas9 virulence-blocking module. We show that both ABDs block the development of a murine subcutaneous S. aureus abscess and that the bactericidal module rescues mice given a lethal dose of S. aureus intraperitoneally.

30245013	A major challenge in genetics is to identify genetic variants driving natural phenotypic variation. However, current methods of genetic mapping have limited resolution. To address this challenge, we developed a CRISPR-Cas9-based high-throughput genome editing approach that can introduce thousands of specific genetic variants in a single experiment. This enabled us to study the fitness consequences of 16,006 natural genetic variants in yeast. We identified 572 variants with significant fitness differences in glucose media; these are highly enriched in promoters, particularly in transcription factor binding sites, while only 19.2% affect amino acid sequences. Strikingly, nearby variants nearly always favor the same parent's alleles, suggesting that lineage-specific selection is often driven by multiple clustered variants. In sum, our genome editing approach reveals the genetic architecture of fitness variation at single-base resolution and could be adapted to measure the effects of genome-wide genetic variation in any screen for cell survival or cell-sortable markers.

30242813	CRISPR/Cas9 is a rapidly developing gene editing technology that will soon have many clinical applications. As with many other new technologies, somatic gene editing with CRISPR/Cas9 raises concerns about equitable access to therapies by historically disenfranchised racial and ethnic minorities. We describe justice concerns related to CRISPR/Cas9, including its potential impact on historically mistreated populations through underrepresentation of minorities in genomic databases and the potential for disparate access to somatic gene therapies when they become clinically available. We then describe ongoing work that aims to address these justice concerns. We conclude by highlighting important considerations to ensure equitable access to therapies going forward, including enhancing diversity in genomic sequencing efforts, improving education and transparency, and building partnerships with underserved and socially disenfranchised communities.

30242691	Genetic engineering plays an essential role in the development of cell lines for biopharmaceutical manufacturing. Advanced gene editing tools can improve both the productivity of recombinant cell lines as well as the quality of therapeutic antibodies. Antibody glycosylation is a critical quality attribute for therapeutic biologics because the glycan patterns on the antibody fragment crystallizable (Fc) region can alter its clinical efficacy and safety as a therapeutic drug. As an example, recombinant antibodies derived from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are generally highly fucosylated; the absence of fucose significantly enhances antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) against cancer cells. This chapter describes a protocol applying clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) to disrupt the α-1,6-fucosyltranferase (FUT8) gene and subsequently inhibit α-1,6-fucosylation on antibodies expressed in CHO cells.

30241742	Persistent high-risk HPV infection is the main cause of cervical cancer. The HPV oncogene E7 plays an important role in HPV carcinogenesis. Currently, HPV vaccines do not offer an effective treatment for women who already present with cervical disease, and recommended periodical cervical screenings are difficult to perform in countries and areas lacking medical resources. Our aim was to develop nanoparticles (NPs) based on poly (β-amino ester) (PBAE) and HPV16 E7-targeting CRISPR/short hairpin RNA (shRNA) to reduce the levels of HPV16 E7 as a preliminary form of a drug to treat HPV infection and its related cervical malignancy. Our NPs showed low toxicity in cells and mouse organs. By reducing the expression of HPV16 E7, our NPs could inhibit the growth of cervical cancer cells and xenograft tumors in nude mice, and they could reverse the malignant cervical epithelium phenotype in HPV16 transgenic mice. The performance of NPs containing shRNA is better than that of NPs containing CRISPR. HPV-targeting NPs consisting of PBAE and CRISPR/shRNA could potentially be developed as drugs to treat HPV infection and HPV-related cervical malignancy.

30241607	CRISPR-Cas endonucleases directed against foreign nucleic acids mediate prokaryotic adaptive immunity and have been tailored for broad genetic engineering applications. Type VI-D CRISPR systems contain the smallest known family of single effector Cas enzymes, and their signature Cas13d ribonuclease employs guide RNAs to cleave matching target RNAs. To understand the molecular basis for Cas13d function and explain its compact molecular architecture, we resolved cryoelectron microscopy structures of Cas13d-guide RNA binary complex and Cas13d-guide-target RNA ternary complex to 3.4 and 3.3 Å resolution, respectively. Furthermore, a 6.5 Å reconstruction of apo Cas13d combined with hydrogen-deuterium exchange revealed conformational dynamics that have implications for RNA scanning. These structures, together with biochemical and cellular characterization, provide insights into its RNA-guided, RNA-targeting mechanism and delineate a blueprint for the rational design of improved transcriptome engineering technologies.

30241032	Myostatin (Mstn) is postulated to be a key determinant of muscle loss and cachexia in cancer. However, no experimental evidence supports a role for Mstn in cancer, particularly in regulating the survival and growth of cancer cells. In this study, we showed that the expression of Mstn was significantly increased in different tumor tissues and human cancer cells. Mstn knockdown inhibited the proliferation of cancer cells. A knockout (KO) of Mstn created by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein (Cas) 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) induced mitochondria-dependent apoptosis in HeLa cells. Furthermore, KO of Mstn reduced the lipid content. Molecular analyses demonstrated that the expression levels of fatty acid oxidation-related genes were upregulated and then increased rate of fatty acid oxidation. Mstn deficiency-induced apoptosis took place along with generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and elevated fatty acid oxidation, which may play a role in triggering mitochondrial membrane depolarization, the release of cytochrome c (Cyt-c), and caspase activation. Importantly, apoptosis induced by Mstn KO was partially rescued by antioxidants and etomoxir, thereby suggesting that the increased level of ROS was functionally involved in mediating apoptosis. Overall, our findings demonstrate a novel function of Mstn in regulating mitochondrial metabolism and apoptosis within cancer cells. Hence, inhibiting the production and function of Mstn may be an effective therapeutic intervention during cancer progression and muscle loss in cachexia.

30239882	Cpf1s, the RNA-guided nucleases of the class II clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats system require a short motive called protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) to be present next to the targeted sequence for their activity. The TTTV PAM sequence of As- and LbCpf1 nucleases is relatively rare in the genome of higher eukaryotic organisms. Here, we show that two other Cpf1 nucleases, Fn- and MbCpf1, which have been reported to utilize a shorter, more frequently occurring PAM sequence (TTN) when tested in vitro, carry out efficient genome modification in mammalian cells. We found that all four Cpf1 nucleases showed similar activities and TTTV PAM preferences. Our approach also revealed that besides their activities their PAM preferences are also target dependent. To increase the number of the available targets for Fn- and MbCpf1 we generated their RVR and RR mutants with altered PAM specificity and compared them to the wild-type and analogous As- and LbCpf1 variants. The mutants gained new PAM specificities but retained their activity on targets with TTTV PAMs, redefining RR-Cpf1's PAM-specificities as TTYV/TCCV, respectively. These variants may become versatile substitutes for wild-type Cpf1s by providing an expanded range of targets for genome engineering applications.

30238691	Nucleic acid-based therapy specially needs a safe and robust delivery vector. Herein, a novel fluorinated acid-labile branched hydroxyl-rich polycation (ARP-F) is proposed for the flexible and effective delivery nanovector of different plasmids including reporter genes and the Cas9 plasmid. Acid-responsive polycation (ARP) with plentiful ortho ester linkages and hydroxyl groups is first synthesized via a facile one-pot ring-opening polymerization, followed by decoration of fluorinated alkyl chains onto ARP to achieve ARP-F. ARP-F possesses good pH-responsive degradability, biocompatibility, and its preliminary transfection ability evaluated by reporter plasmids pRL-CMV (encoding Renilla luciferase) and pEGFP-N1 (encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein) is also excellent. CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat/CRISPR-associated nuclease 9) technology is a potent genome-editing tool. The subsequent delivery of pCas9-surv (one typical all-in-one Cas9 plasmid) mediated by ARP-F exhibits impressive in vitro and in vivo tumor inhibition performances. In addition, the combination of ARP-F/pCas9-surv with temozolomide could further enhance tumor inhibition activities by increasing the sensitivity of cancer cells to anticancer drugs. Such high-performance polycation would provide a very promising means to produce efficient delivery nanovectors of versatile plasmids.	Y Qi|H Song|H Xiao|G Cheng|B Yu|FJ Xu
30238143	The oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica is widely used for the production of both bulk and fine chemicals, including organic acids, fatty acid-derived biofuels and chemicals, polyunsaturated fatty acids, single-cell proteins, terpenoids, and other valuable products. Consequently, it is becoming increasingly popular for metabolic engineering applications. Multiple gene manipulation tools including URA blast, Cre/LoxP, and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) have been developed for metabolic engineering in Y. lipolytica. However, the low efficiency and time-consuming procedures involved in these methods hamper further research. The emergence of the CRISPR/Cas system offers a potential solution for these problems due to its high efficiency, ease of operation, and time savings, which can significantly accelerate the genomic engineering of Y. lipolytica. In this review, we summarize the research progress on the development of CRISPR/Cas systems for Y. lipolytica, including Cas9 proteins and sgRNA expression strategies, as well as gene knock-out/knock-in and repression/activation applications. Finally, the most promising and tantalizing future prospects in this area are highlighted.	TQ Shi|H Huang|EJ Kerkhoven|XJ Ji

30237405	This study develops a new method for detecting and typing target DNA based on Cas9 nuclease, which was named as ctPCR, representing Cas9-sgRNA- or CRISPR-typing PCR. The technique can detect and type target DNA easily, rapidly, specifically, and sensitively. This technique detects target DNA in three steps: (1) amplifying target DNA with PCR by using a pair of universal primers (PCR1); (2) treating PCR1 products with a process referred to as CAT, representing Cas9 cutting, A tailing and T adaptor ligation; (3) amplifying the CAT-treated DNA with PCR by using a pair of general-specific primers (gs-primers) (PCR2). This method was verified by detecting HPV16 and HPV18 L1 gene in 13 different high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) subtypes. This method was also verified by detecting the L1 and E6-E7 genes of two high-risk HPVs (HPV16 and 18) in cervical carcinoma cells and many clinical samples. In this method, PCR1 was performed to determine if the detected DNA sample contained the target DNA (such as virus infection), while PCR2 was performed to discriminate which genotypic target DNA was present in the detected DNA sample (such as virus subtypes). Based on these proof-of-concept experiments, this study provides a new CRISPR/Cas9-based DNA detection and typing method.	Q Wang|B Zhang|X Xu|F Long|J Wang

30231020	This paper applies objective methods to explore the technological origins of the widely acclaimed CRISPR breakthrough in the technological domain of genome engineering. Previously developed patent search techniques are first used to recover a set of patents that well-represent the genome editing domain before CRISPR. Main paths are then determined from the citation network associated with this patent set allowing identification of the three major knowledge trajectories. The most significant of these trajectories for CRISPR involves the core of genome editing with less significant trajectories involving cloning and endonuclease specific developments. The major patents on the core trajectory are consistent with qualitative expert knowledge of the topical area. A second set of patents that we call the CRISPR roots are obtained by finding the patents directly cited by the recent CRISPR patents along with patents cited by that set of patents. We find that the CRISPR roots contain 8 key patents from the genome engineering main path associated with restriction endonucleases and the expected strong connection of CRISPR to prior genome editing technology such as Zn finger nucleases. Nonetheless, analysis of the full CRISPR roots shows that a very wide array of technological knowledge beyond genome engineering has contributed to achieving the CRISPR breakthrough. Such breadth in origins is not surprising since "spillover" is generally perceived as important and previous qualitative studies of CRISPR have shown not only technological breadth in origins but scientific breadth as well. In addition, we find that the estimated rate of functional performance improvement of the CRISPR roots set is about 9% per year compared to the genome engineering set (~4% per year). These estimates indicate below average rates of improvement and may indicate that CRISPR (and perhaps yet undiscovered) genome engineering developments could evolve in effectiveness over an upcoming long rather than short time period.

30229357	Tendencies and efforts have shifted from genome description, DNA mapping, and DNA sequencing to active and profound re-programming, repairing life on genetic and molecular levels in some parts of contemporary life science research. Mirroring and materializing this atmosphere, various life engineering technologies have been used and established in many areas of life sciences in the last decades. A contemporary progressive example of one such technology is DNA editing. Novel developments related to reproductive technologies, particularly embryo editing, prenatal human life engineering, and germline engineering need to be analyzed against the broader social and structural background. The crucial analytical scope for this paper is a specific field: the life-editing technologies used in reproductive medicine and performed experimentally on viable human embryos, particularly CRISPR/Cas9 technology. This text argues that germline editing technologies, as a representative part of contemporary biomedicine, are merging ideas of treatment and enhancement to avoid future risks. Using this specific life manipulation of embryos and gametes, the text analyzes these processes within the concept of power over life-biopower and the specific governing rationality that imagines, classifies, and governs contemporary societies. The text specifically focuses on the potential to create, define, and manage future risks and uncertainties related to prenatal life.	E Šlesingerová
30227873	Microbial biosynthesis of natural products holds promise for preclinical studies and treating diseases. For instance, pinocembrin is a natural flavonoid with important pharmacologic characteristics and is widely used in preclinical studies. However, high yield of natural products production is often limited by the intracellular cofactor level, including adenosine triphosphate (ATP). To address this challenge, tailored modification of ATP concentration in Escherichia coli was applied in efficient pinocembrin production.	In the present study, a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) interference system was performed for screening several ATP-related candidate genes, where metK and proB showed its potential to improve ATP level and increased pinocembrin production. Subsequently, the repression efficiency of metK and proB were optimized to achieve the appropriate levels of ATP and enhancing the pinocembrin production, which allowed the pinocembrin titer increased to 102.02 mg/L. Coupled with the malonyl-CoA engineering and optimization of culture and induction condition, a final pinocembrin titer of 165.31 mg/L was achieved, which is 10.2-fold higher than control strains.	Our results introduce a strategy to approach the efficient biosynthesis of pinocembrin via ATP level strengthen using CRISPR interference. Furthermore coupled with the malonyl-CoA engineering and induction condition have been optimized for pinocembrin production. The results and engineering strategies demonstrated here would hold promise for the ATP level improvement of other flavonoids by CRISPRi system, thereby facilitating other flavonoids production.

30224801	The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an architecturally diverse organelle that serves as a membrane source for the replication of multiple viruses. Flaviviruses, including yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, dengue virus and Zika virus, induce unique single-membrane ER invaginations that house the viral replication machinery1. Whether this virus-induced ER remodelling is vulnerable to antiviral pathways is unknown. Here, we show that flavivirus replication at the ER is targeted by the interferon (IFN) response. Through genome-scale CRISPR screening, we uncovered an antiviral mechanism mediated by a functional gene pairing between IFI6 (encoding IFN-α-inducible protein 6), an IFN-stimulated gene cloned over 30 years ago2, and HSPA5, which encodes the ER-resident heat shock protein 70 chaperone BiP. We reveal that IFI6 is an ER-localized integral membrane effector that is stabilized through interactions with BiP. Mechanistically, IFI6 prophylactically protects uninfected cells by preventing the formation of virus-induced ER membrane invaginations. Notably, IFI6 has little effect on other mammalian RNA viruses, including the related Flaviviridae family member hepatitis C virus, which replicates in double-membrane vesicles that protrude outwards from the ER. These findings support a model in which the IFN response is armed with a membrane-targeted effector that discriminately blocks the establishment of virus-specific ER microenvironments that are required for replication.

30223943	Neuropeptides are evolutionarily ancient peptide hormones of the nervous and neuroendocrine systems, and are thought to have regulated metamorphosis in early animal ancestors. In particular, the deeply conserved Wamide family of neuropeptides-shared across Bilateria (e.g. insects and worms) and its sister group Cnidaria (e.g. jellyfishes and corals)-has been implicated in mediating life-cycle transitions, yet their endogenous roles remain poorly understood. By using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated reverse genetics, we show that cnidarian Wamide-referred to as GLWamide-regulates the timing of life cycle transition in the sea anemone cnidarian Nematostella vectensis. We find that mutant planula larvae lacking GLWamides transform into morphologically normal polyps at a rate slower than that of the wildtype control larvae. Treatment of GLWamide null mutant larvae with synthetic GLWamide peptides is sufficient to restore a normal rate of metamorphosis. These results demonstrate that GLWamide plays a dispensable, modulatory role in accelerating metamorphosis in a sea anemone.	N Nakanishi|MQ Martindale
30222773	The CRISPR/Cas9 system is an RNA guided nuclease system that evolved as a mechanism of adaptive immunity in bacteria. This system has been adopted for numerous genome engineering applications in research and recently, therapeutics. The CRISPR/Cas9 system has been largely implemented by delivery of Cas9 as protein, RNA, or plasmid along with a chimeric crRNA-tracrRNA guide RNA (gRNA) under the expression of a pol III promoter, such as U6. Using this approach, multiplex genome engineering has been achieved by delivering several U6-gRNA plasmids targeting multiple loci. However, this approach is limited due to the efficiently of delivering multiple plasmids to a single cell at one time. To augment the capability and accessibility of multiplexed genome engineering, we developed an efficient golden gate based method to assemble gRNAs linked by optimal Csy4 ribonuclease sequences to deliver up to 10 gRNAs as a single gRNA array transcript. Here we report the optimal expression of our guide RNA array under a strong pol II promoter. This system can be implemented alongside the myriad of CRISPR applications, allowing users to model complex biological processes requiring numerous gRNAs.

30217854	Klebsiella pneumoniae is a promising industrial microorganism as well as a major human pathogen. The recent emergence of carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae has posed a serious threat to public health worldwide, emphasizing a dire need for novel therapeutic means against drug-resistant K. pneumoniae Despite the critical importance of genetics in bioengineering, physiology studies, and therapeutic-means development, genome editing, in particular, the highly desirable scarless genetic manipulation in K. pneumoniae, is often time-consuming and laborious. Here, we report a two-plasmid system, pCasKP-pSGKP, used for precise and iterative genome editing in K. pneumoniae By harnessing the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas9 genome cleavage system and the lambda Red recombination system, pCasKP-pSGKP enabled highly efficient genome editing in K. pneumoniae using a short repair template. Moreover, we developed a cytidine base-editing system, pBECKP, for precise C→T conversion in both the chromosomal and plasmid-borne genes by engineering the fusion of the cytidine deaminase APOBEC1 and a Cas9 nickase. By using both the pCasKP-pSGKP and the pBECKP tools, the blaKPC-2 gene was confirmed to be the major factor that contributed to the carbapenem resistance of a hypermucoviscous carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae strain. The development of the two editing tools will significantly facilitate the genetic engineering of K. pneumoniaeIMPORTANCE Genetics is a key means to study bacterial physiology. However, the highly desirable scarless genetic manipulation is often time-consuming and laborious for the major human pathogen K. pneumoniae We developed a CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome-editing method and a cytidine base-editing system, enabling rapid, highly efficient, and iterative genome editing in both industrial and clinically isolated K. pneumoniae strains. We applied both tools in dissecting the drug resistance mechanism of a hypermucoviscous carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae strain, elucidating that the blaKPC-2 gene was the major factor that contributed to the carbapenem resistance of the hypermucoviscous carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae strain. Utilization of the two tools will dramatically accelerate a wide variety of investigations in diverse K. pneumoniae strains and relevant Enterobacteriaceae species, such as gene characterization, drug discovery, and metabolic engineering.

30217225	Homeodomain (HD) transcription factor (TF) NKX2-1 critical for the regional specification of the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) as well as promoting the GABAergic and cholinergic neuron fates via the induction of TFs such as LHX6 and LHX8. NKX2-1 defines MGE regional identity in large part through transcriptional repression, while specification and maturation of GABAergic and cholinergic fates is mediated in part by transcriptional activation via TFs such as LHX6 and LHX8. Here we analyze the signaling and TF pathways, downstream of NKX2-1, required for GABAergic and cholinergic neuron fate maturation.	Differential ChIP-seq analysis was used to identify regulatory elements (REs) where chromatin state was sensitive to change in the Nkx2-1cKO MGE at embryonic day (E) 13.5. TF motifs in the REs were identified using RSAT. CRISPR-mediated genome editing was used to generate enhancer knockouts. Differential gene expression in these knockouts was analyzed through RT-qPCR and in situ hybridization. Functional analysis of motifs within hs623 was analyzed via site directed mutagenesis and reporter assays in primary MGE cultures.	We identified 4782 activating REs (aREs) and 6391 repressing REs (rREs) in the Nkx2-1 conditional knockout (Nkx2-1cKO) MGE. aREs are associated with basic-Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLH) TFs. Deletion of hs623, an intragenic Tcf12 aRE, caused a reduction of Tcf12 expression in the sub-ventricular zone (SVZ) and mantle zone (MZ) of the MGE. Mutation of LHX, SOX and octamers, within hs623, caused a reduction of hs623 activity in MGE primary cultures.	Tcf12 expression in the SVZ of the MGE is mediated through aRE hs623. The activity of hs623 is dependent on LHX6, SOX and octamers. Thus, maintaining the expression of Tcf12 in the SVZ involves on TF pathways parallel and genetically downstream of NKX2-1.

30213916	The nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway preserves genome stability by ligating the ends of broken chromosomes together. It employs end-processing enzymes, including polymerases, to prepare ends for ligation. We show that two such polymerases incorporate primarily ribonucleotides during NHEJ-an exception to the central dogma of molecular biology-both during repair of chromosome breaks made by Cas9 and during V(D)J recombination. Moreover, additions of ribonucleotides but not deoxynucleotides effectively promote ligation. Repair kinetics suggest that ribonucleotide-dependent first-strand ligation is followed by complementary strand repair with deoxynucleotides, then by replacement of ribonucleotides embedded in the first strand with deoxynucleotides. Our results indicate that as much as 65% of cellular NHEJ products have transiently embedded ribonucleotides, which promote flexibility in repair at the cost of more fragile intermediates.

30211128	Infection with the apicomplexan protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii is an ongoing public health problem. The parasite's ability to invade and replicate within the host cell is dependent on many effectors, such as dense granule proteins (GRAs) released from the specialized organelle dense granules, into host cells. GRAs have emerged as important determinants of T. gondii pathogenesis. However, the functions of some GRAs remain undefined. In this study, we used CRISPR-Cas9 technique to disrupt 17 GRA genes (GRA11, GRA12 bis, GRA13, GRA14, GRA20, GRA21, GRA28-31, GRA33-38, and GRA40) in the virulent T. gondii RH strain. The CRISPR-Cas9 constructs abolished the expression of the 17 GRA genes. Functional characterization of single ΔGRA mutants was achieved in vitro using cell-based plaque assay and egress assay, and in vivo in BALB/c mice. Targeted deletion of these 17 GRA genes had no significant effect neither on the in vitro growth and egress of the mutant strains from the host cells nor on the parasite virulence in the mouse model of infection. Comparative analysis of the transcriptomics data of the 17 GRA genes suggest that GRAs may serve different functions in different genotypes and life cycle stages of the parasite. In sum, although these 17 GRAs might not be essential for RH strain growth in vitro or virulence in mice, they may have roles in other strains or parasite stages, which warrants further investigations.

30205712	Since the completion of genome sequencing, gene silencing technologies have emerged as powerful tools to study gene functions in various biological processes, both in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, they have also been proposed as therapeutic agents to inhibit selected genes in a variety of pathological conditions, such as cancer, neurodegenerative, and cardiovascular diseases. Area covered: This review summarizes the mechanisms of action and applications of genome editing tools, from RNA interference to clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-based systems, in research and in clinics. We describe their essential role in high-throughput genetic screens and, in particular, in functional proteomics studies, to identify diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets. Indeed, gene silencing and proteomics have been extensively integrated to study global proteome changes, posttranslational modifications, and protein-protein interactions. Expert commentary: Functional proteomics approaches that leverage gene silencing tools have been successfully applied to examine the role of several genes in various contexts, leading to a deeper knowledge of biological pathways and disease mechanisms. Recent developments of gene silencing tools have improved their performance, also in terms of off-targets effects reduction, paving the way for a wider therapeutic application of these systems.

30205462	Due to recent advances in next-generation sequencing over the past decade, our understanding of the human microbiome and its relationship to health and disease has increased dramatically. Yet, our insights into the human virome, and its interplay with important microbes that impact human health, is relatively limited. Prokaryotic and eukaryotic viruses are present throughout the human body, comprising a large and diverse population which influences several niches and impacts our health at various body sites. The presence of prokaryotic viruses like phages, has been documented at many different body sites, with the human gut being the richest ecological niche. Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) and associated proteins constitute the adaptive immune system of bacteria, which prevents attack by invasive nucleic acid. CRISPR-Cas systems function by uptake and integration of foreign genetic element sequences into the CRISPR array, which constitutes a genomic archive of iterative vaccination events. Consequently, CRISPR spacers can be investigated to reconstruct interplay between viruses and bacteria, and metagenomic sequencing data can be exploited to provide insights into host-phage interactions within a niche. Here, we show how the CRISPR spacer content of commensal and pathogenic bacteria can be used to determine the evidence of their phage exposure. This framework opens new opportunities for investigating host-virus dynamics in metagenomic data, and highlights the need to dedicate more efforts for virome sampling and sequencing.

30204770	CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) using dCas9-sgRNA is a powerful tool for the exploration and manipulation of gene functions. Here we quantify the reversible switching of a central process of the bacterial cell cycle by CRISPRi and an antisense RNA mechanism. Reversible induction of filamentous growth in E. coli has been recently demonstrated by controlling the expression levels of the bacterial cell division proteins FtsZ/FtsA via CRISPRi. If FtsZ falls below a critical level, cells cannot divide. However, the cells remain metabolically active and continue with DNA replication. We surmised that this makes them amenable to an inducible antisense RNA strategy to counteract FtsZ inhibition. We show that both static and inducible thresholds can adjust the characteristics of the switching process. Combining bulk data with single cell measurements, we characterize the efficiency of the switching process. Successful restoration of division is found to occur faster in the presence of antisense sgRNAs than upon simple termination of CRISPRi induction.	A Mückl|M Schwarz-Schilling|K Fischer|FC Simmel
30193985	CRISPR-Cas is a prokaryotic adaptive immune system that functions by incorporating fragments of foreign DNA into CRISPR arrays. The arrays containing spacers derived from foreign DNA are transcribed, and the transcripts are processed to generate spacer-containing mature CRISPR-RNAs that are employed as guides to specifically recognize and cleave the DNA or RNA of the cognate parasitic genetic elements. The CRISPR-Cas systems show remarkable complexity and diversity of molecular organization and appear to be involved in various cellular functions that are distinct from, even if connected to, adaptive immunity. In this review, we discuss some of such functional links of CRISPR-Cas systems including their effect on horizontal gene transfer that can be either inhibitory or stimulatory, connections between CRISPR-Cas and DNA repair systems as well as programmed cell death and signal transduction mechanisms, and potential role of CRISPR-Cas in transposon integration and plasmid maintenance. The interplay between the primary function of CRISPR-Cas as an adaptive immunity mechanism and these other roles defines the richness of the biological effects of these systems and affects their spread among bacteria and archaea.

30193849	Recognition of viral RNA by the retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) initiates innate antiviral immune response. How the binding of viral RNA to and activation of the RLRs are regulated remains enigmatic. In this study, we identified ZCCHC3 as a positive regulator of the RLRs including RIG-I and MDA5. ZCCHC3 deficiency markedly inhibited RNA virus-triggered induction of downstream antiviral genes, and ZCCHC3-deficient mice were more susceptible to RNA virus infection. ZCCHC3 was associated with RIG-I and MDA5 and functions in two distinct processes for regulation of RIG-I and MDA5 activities. ZCCHC3 bound to dsRNA and enhanced the binding of RIG-I and MDA5 to dsRNA. ZCCHC3 also recruited the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM25 to the RIG-I and MDA5 complexes to facilitate its K63-linked polyubiquitination and activation. Thus, ZCCHC3 is a co-receptor for RIG-I and MDA5, which is critical for RLR-mediated innate immune response to RNA virus.

30191429	Bacteriophage contamination and cell lysis have been recurring issues with some actinomycetes used in the pharmaceutical fermentation industry since the commercialization of streptomycin in the 1940s. In the early years, spontaneous phage-resistant mutants or lysogens were isolated to address the problem. In some cases, multiple phages were isolated from different contaminated fermentors, so strains resistant to multiple phages were isolated to stabilize the fermentation processes. With the advent of recombinant DNA technology, the early scaleup of the Escherichia coli fermentation process for the production of human insulin A and B chains encountered contamination with multiple coliphages. A genetic engineering solution was to clone and express a potent restriction/modification system in the production strains. Very recently, an E. coli fermentation of 1,3-propanediol was contaminated by a coliphage related to T1. CRISPR/Cas9 technology was applied to block future contamination by targeting seven different phage genes for double-strand cleavage. These approaches employing spontaneous mutation, genetic engineering, and synthetic biology can be applied to many current and future microorganisms used in the biotechnology industry.	RH Baltz
30190322	RNA-guided, engineered nucleases derived from the prokaryotic adaptive immune system CRISPR-Cas represent a powerful platform for gene deletion and editing. When used as a therapeutic approach, direct delivery of Cas9 protein and single-guide RNA (sgRNA) could circumvent the safety issues associated with plasmid delivery and therefore represents an attractive tool for precision genome engineering. Gene deletion or editing in adipose tissue to enhance its energy expenditure, fatty acid oxidation, and secretion of bioactive factors through a "browning" process presents a potential therapeutic strategy to alleviate metabolic disease. Here, we developed "CRISPR-delivery particles," denoted CriPs, composed of nano-size complexes of Cas9 protein and sgRNA that are coated with an amphipathic peptide called Endo-Porter that mediates entry into cells. Efficient CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene deletion of ectopically expressed GFP by CriPs was achieved in multiple cell types, including a macrophage cell line, primary macrophages, and primary pre-adipocytes. Significant GFP loss was also observed in peritoneal exudate cells with minimum systemic toxicity in GFP-expressing mice following intraperitoneal injection of CriPs containing Gfp-targeting sgRNA. Furthermore, disruption of a nuclear co-repressor of catabolism, the Nrip1 gene, in white adipocytes by CriPs enhanced adipocyte browning with a marked increase of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) expression. Of note, the CriP-mediated Nrip1 deletion did not produce detectable off-target effects. We conclude that CriPs offer an effective Cas9 and sgRNA delivery system for ablating targeted gene products in cultured cells and in vivo, providing a potential therapeutic strategy for metabolic disease.

30185626	A recent study reveals why the Cas12a genome-editing enzyme is more specific than the widely used Cas9. For Cas12a to cut, the guide RNA it carries must more closely match the sequence of the DNA target than with Cas9. The enzyme's specificity may make it a better choice for gene-editing applications.
30181344	Proteogenomics and ribosome profiling concurrently show that genes may code for both a large and one or more small proteins translated from annotated coding sequences (CDSs) and unannotated alternative open reading frames (named alternative ORFs or altORFs), respectively, but the stoichiometry between large and small proteins translated from a same gene is unknown. MIEF1, a gene recently identified as a dual-coding gene, harbors a CDS and a newly annotated and actively translated altORF located in the 5'UTR. Here, we use absolute quantification with stable isotope-labeled peptides and parallel reaction monitoring to determine levels of both proteins in two human cells lines and in human colon. We report that the main MIEF1 translational product is not the canonical 463 amino acid MiD51 protein but the small 70 amino acid alternative MiD51 protein (altMiD51). These results demonstrate the inadequacy of the single CDS concept and provide a strong argument for incorporating altORFs and small proteins in functional annotations.

30180948	Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are fundamental genomic regulatory factors under various physiological and pathological conditions. A class of lncRNAs termed architectural RNAs (arcRNAs) plays an essential scaffolding role in building nuclear bodies. NEAT1 arcRNA is an abundant, nuclear-retained lncRNA that constructs paraspeckle nuclear bodies. NEAT1 is upregulated in various developmental and disease conditions including cancer and virus infection. However, it remains unclear how elevated expression of NEAT1 influences such conditions. Here, we set up an experimental method to selectively increase NEAT1 expression. We applied the synergistic activation mediator (SAM) system using catalytically dead Cas9 (dCas9) proteins to activate transcription of the NEAT1 gene. We examined 10 pre-designed and 15 originally designed single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) in the NEAT1 promoter region for CRISPR activation (CRISPRa). We validated several sgRNAs that we designed for the SAM system to strongly activate NEAT1 expression in two human cell lines and induced formation of paraspeckles with intact core-shell structures. Thus, this selective NEAT1 upregulation method using the SAM system would be useful for further functional analyses of NEAT1 lncRNA in both basic and applied research.

30180160	Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 technology has rapidly emerged as a very effective tool for gene editing. Although great advances on gene editing in the medical entomology field have arisen, no attempts of gene editing have been reported in sand flies, the vectors of Leishmaniasis.	Here, we described a detailed protocol for sand fly embryo microinjection taking into consideration the sand fly life cycle, and manipulation and oviposition requirements of this non-model organism. Following our microinjection protocol, a hatching rate of injected embryos of 11.90%-14.22% was achieved, a rate consistent with other non-model organism dipterans such as mosquitoes. Essential factors for the adaptation of CRISPR/Cas9 technology to the sand fly field were addressed including the selection of a target gene and the design and production of sgRNA. An in vitro cleavage assay was optimized to test the activity of each sgRNA and a protocol for Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (spCas9) protein expression and purification was described. Relevant considerations for a successful gene editing in the sand fly such as specifics of embryology and double-stranded break DNA repair mechanisms were discussed.	The step-by-step methodology reported in this article will be of significant use for setting up a sand fly embryo microinjection station for the incorporation of CRISPR/Cas9 technology in the sand fly field. Gene editing strategies used in mosquitoes and other model insects have been adapted to work with sand flies, providing the tools and relevant information for adapting gene editing techniques to the vectors of Leishmaniasis. Gene editing in sand flies will provide essential information on the biology of these vectors of medical and veterinary relevance and will rise a better understanding of vector-parasite-host interactions.

30177380	High-throughput genetic screens interfering with gene expression are invaluable tools to identify gene function and phenotype-to-genotype interactions. Implementing such screens in the laboratory is challenging, and the choice between currently available technologies based on RNAi and CRISPR/Cas9 (CRISPR-associated protein 9) is not trivial. Identifying reliable candidate hits requires a streamlined experimental setup adjusted to the specific biological question. Here, we provide a critical assessment of the various RNAi/CRISPR approaches to pooled screens and discuss their advantages and pitfalls. We specify a set of best practices for key parameters enabling a reproducible screen and provide a detailed overview of analysis methods and repositories for identifying the best candidate gene hits.

30171202	Many bacteria and archaea have the unique ability to heritably alter their genomes by incorporating small fragments of foreign DNA, called spacers, into CRISPR loci. Once transcribed and processed into individual CRISPR RNAs, spacer sequences guide Cas effector nucleases to destroy complementary, invading nucleic acids. Collectively, these two processes are known as the CRISPR-Cas immune response. In this Progress article, we review recent studies that have advanced our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying spacer acquisition and that have revealed a fundamental link between the two phases of CRISPR immunity that ensures optimal immunity from newly acquired spacers. Finally, we highlight important open questions and discuss the potential basic and applied impact of spacer acquisition research.	J McGinn|LA Marraffini
30170999	Salmonella enterica is represented by >2,600 serovars that can differ in routes of transmission, host colonization, and in resistance to antimicrobials. S. enterica is the leading bacterial cause of foodborne illness in the United States, with well-established detection methodology. Current surveillance protocols rely on the characterization of a few colonies to represent an entire sample; thus, minority serovars remain undetected. Salmonella contains two CRISPR loci, CRISPR1 and CRISPR2, and the spacer contents of these can be considered serovar specific. We exploited this property to develop an amplicon-based and multiplexed sequencing approach, CRISPR-SeroSeq (serotyping by sequencing of the CRISPR loci), to identify multiple serovars present in a single sample. Using mixed genomic DNA from two Salmonella serovars, we were able to confidently detect a serovar that constituted 0.01% of the sample. Poultry is a major reservoir of Salmonella spp., including serovars that are frequently associated with human illness, as well as those that are not. Numerous studies have examined the prevalence and diversity of Salmonella spp. in poultry, though these studies were limited to culture-based approaches and therefore only identified abundant serovars. CRISPR-SeroSeq was used to investigate samples from broiler houses and a processing facility. Ninety-one percent of samples harbored multiple serovars, and there was one sample in which four different serovars were detected. In another sample, reads for the minority serovar comprised 0.003% of the total number of Salmonella spacer reads. The most abundant serovars identified were Salmonella enterica serovars Montevideo, Kentucky, Enteritidis, and Typhimurium. CRISPR-SeroSeq also differentiated between multiple strains of some serovars. This high resolution of serovar populations has the potential to be utilized as a powerful tool in the surveillance of Salmonella species.IMPORTANCESalmonella enterica is the leading bacterial cause of foodborne illness in the United States and is represented by over 2,600 distinct serovars. Some of these serovars are pathogenic in humans, while others are not. Current surveillance for this pathogen is limited by the detection of only the most abundant serovars, due to the culture-based approaches that are used. Thus, pathogenic serovars that are present in a minority remain undetected. By exploiting serovar-specific differences in the CRISPR arrays of Salmonella spp., we have developed a high-throughput sequencing tool to be able to identify multiple serovars in a single sample and tested this in multiple poultry samples. This novel approach allows differences in the dynamics of individual Salmonella serovars to be measured and can have a significant impact on understanding the ecology of this pathogen with respect to zoonotic risk and public health.

30170889	Currently, infertility affects ∼16% of couples worldwide. The causes are reported to involve both male and female factors, including fertilization failure between mature spermatozoa and eggs. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in each step of mammalian fertilization are yet to be fully elucidated. Although some of these steps can be rescued with assisted reproductive technologies, it is important to clarify the molecular mechanisms involved for the treatment and diagnosis of infertile couples. This review illustrates recent findings in mammalian fertilization, discovered by combining gene modification techniques with other new approaches, and aims to show how these findings will guide future research in mammalian fertilization.

30169977	Therapeutic gene editing is becoming a viable biomedical tool with the emergence of the CRISPR/Cas9 system. CRISPR-based technologies have promise as a therapeutic platform for many human genetic diseases previously considered untreatable, providing a flexible approach to high-fidelity gene editing. For many diseases, such as sickle-cell disease and beta thalassemia, curative therapy may already be on the horizon, with CRISPR-based clinical trials slated for the next few years. Translation of CRISPR-based therapy to in vivo application however, is no small feat, and major hurdles remain for efficacious use of the CRISPR/Cas9 system in clinical contexts.	In this topical review, we highlight recent advances to in vivo delivery of the CRISPR/Cas9 system using various packaging formats, including viral, mRNA, plasmid, and protein-based approaches. We also discuss some of the barriers which have yet to be overcome for successful translation of this technology.	This review focuses on the challenges to efficacy for various delivery formats, with specific emphasis on overcoming these challenges through the development of carrier vehicles for transient approaches to CRISPR/Cas9 delivery in vivo.

30169558	The RNA-guided CRISPR/Cas9 system has been widely applied to genome editing. CRISPR/Cas9 system can effectively edit the on-target genes. Nonetheless, it has recently been demonstrated that many homologous off-target genomic sequences could be mutated, leading to unexpected gene-editing outcomes. Therefore, a plethora of tools were proposed for the prediction of off-target activities of CRISPR/Cas9. Nonetheless, each computational tool has its own advantages and drawbacks under diverse conditions. It is hardly believed that a single tool is optimal for all conditions. Hence, we would like to explore the ensemble learning potential on synergizing multiple tools with genomic annotations together to enhance its predictive abilities.	We proposed an ensemble learning framework which synergizes multiple tools together to predict the off-target activities of CRISPR/Cas9 in different combinations. Interestingly, the ensemble learning using AdaBoost outperformed other individual off-target predictive tools. We also investigated the effect of evolutionary conservation (PhyloP and PhastCons) and chromatin annotations (ChromHMM and Segway) and found that only PhyloP can enhance the predictive capabilities further. Case studies are conducted to reveal ensemble insights into the off-target predictions, demonstrating how the current study can be applied in different genomic contexts. The best prediction predicted by AdaBoost is up to 0.9383 (AUC) and 0.2998 (PRC) that outperforms other classifiers. This is ascribable to the fact that AdaBoost introduces a new weak classifier (i.e. decision stump) in each iteration to learn the DNA sequences that were misclassified as off-targets until a small error rate is reached iteratively.

30159800	The development of biotechnologies has broadly interfered with a number of life processes, including human birth. An important moral question arises from the application of such medical technologies to birth: do biotechnological advancements violate human dignity? Many valid arguments have been raised. Yet bioethicists are still far from reaching a consensus on how best to protect the dignity of human birth. Confucianism is an influential ethical theory in China and presents a distinctive understanding of human dignity. In this paper, we reconstruct the two Confucian concepts of dignity-namely, universal dignity and personal dignity. We then apply these concepts to human birth in the context of biotechnologies involving embryos and genetic enhancement. We conclude that the dual Confucian understanding of dignity contributes a valuable perspective to the question of whether biotechnologies related to human birth violate human dignity.	J Li|Y Li

30157456	The Mediterranean fruit fly Ceratitis capitata is a highly polyphagous and invasive insect pest, causing enormous economic damage in horticultural systems. A successful and environment-friendly control strategy is the sterile insect technique (SIT) that reduces pest populations through infertile matings with mass-released, sterilized insects. However, the SIT is not readily applicable to each pest species. While transgenic approaches hold great promise to improve critical aspects of the SIT to transfer it to new species, they are suspect to strict or even prohibitive legislation regarding the release of genetically modified (GM) organisms. In contrast, specific mutations created via CRISPR-Cas genome editing are not regulated as GM in the US, and might thus allow creating optimal strains for SIT. Here, we describe highly efficient homology-directed repair genome editing in C. capitata by injecting pre-assembled CRISPR-Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes using different guide RNAs and a short single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide donor to convert an enhanced green fluorescent protein in C. capitata into a blue fluorescent protein. Six out of seven fertile and individually backcrossed G0 individuals generated 57-90% knock-in rate within their total offspring and 70-96% knock-in rate within their phenotypically mutant offspring. Based on the achieved efficiency, this approach could also be used to introduce mutations which do not produce a screenable phenotype and identify positive mutants with a reasonable workload. Furthermore, CRISPR-Cas HDR would allow to recreate mutations formerly identified in classical mutagenesis screens and to transfer them to related species to establish new (SIT-like) pest control systems. Considering the potential that CRISPR-induced alterations in organisms could be classified as non-GM in additional countries, such new strains could potentially be used for pest control applications without the need to struggle with GMO directives.

30157178	Over the last decade, multiple broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (bN-mAbs) to the HIV-1 envelope protein (Env) gp120 have been described. Many of these recognize epitopes consisting of both amino acid and glycan residues. Moreover, the glycans required for binding of these bN-mAbs are early intermediates in the N-linked glycosylation pathway. This type of glycosylation substantially alters the mass and net charge of Envs compared to molecules with the same amino acid sequence but possessing mature, complex (sialic acid-containing) carbohydrates. Since cell lines suitable for biopharmaceutical production that limit N-linked glycosylation to mannose-5 (Man5) or earlier intermediates are not readily available, the production of vaccine immunogens displaying these glycan-dependent epitopes has been challenging. Here, we report the development of a stable suspension-adapted Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line that limits glycosylation to Man5 and earlier intermediates. This cell line was created using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) gene editing system and contains a mutation that inactivates the gene encoding Mannosyl (Alpha-1,3-)-Glycoprotein Beta-1,2-N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferase (MGAT1). Monomeric gp120s produced in the MGAT1- CHO cell line exhibit improved binding to prototypic glycan-dependent bN-mAbs directed to the V1/V2 domain (e.g., PG9) and the V3 stem (e.g., PGT128 and 10-1074) while preserving the structure of the important glycan-independent epitopes (e.g., VRC01). The ability of the MGAT1- CHO cell line to limit glycosylation to early intermediates in the N-linked glycosylation pathway without impairing the doubling time or ability to grow at high cell densities suggests that it will be a useful substrate for the biopharmaceutical production of HIV-1 vaccine immunogens.

30156437	The complement system provides host defense against pathogens and environmental stress. C3, the central component of complement, is present in the blood and increases in BAL fluid after injury. We recently discovered that C3 is taken up by certain cell types and cleaved intracellularly to C3a and C3b. C3a is required for CD4+ T-cell survival. These observations made us question whether complement operates at environmental interfaces, particularly in the respiratory tract. We found that airway epithelial cells (AECs, represented by both primary human tracheobronchial cells and BEAS-2B [cell line]) cultured in C3-free media were unique from other cell types in that they contained large intracellular stores of de novo synthesized C3. A fraction of this protein reduced ("storage form") but the remainder did not, consistent with it being pro-C3 ("precursor form"). These two forms of intracellular C3 were absent in CRISPR knockout-induced C3-deficient AECs and decreased with the use of C3 siRNA, indicating endogenous generation. Proinflammatory cytokine exposure increased both stored and secreted forms of C3. Furthermore, AECs took up C3 from exogenous sources, which mitigated stress-associated cell death (e.g., from oxidative stress or starvation). C3 stores were notably increased within AECs in lung tissues from individuals with different end-stage lung diseases. Thus, at-risk cells furnish C3 through biosynthesis and/or uptake to increase locally available C3 during inflammation, while intracellularly, these stores protect against certain inducers of cell death. These results establish the relevance of intracellular C3 to airway epithelial biology and suggest novel pathways for complement-mediated host protection in the airway.

30156038	Lactic-acid bacteria such as Lactobacillus plantarum are commonly used for fermenting foods and as probiotics, where increasingly sophisticated genome-editing tools are employed to elucidate and enhance these microbes' beneficial properties. The most advanced tools to date utilize an oligonucleotide or double-stranded DNA donor for recombineering and Cas9 for targeted DNA cleavage. As the associated methods are often developed in isolation for one strain, it remains unclear how different Cas9-based editing methods compare across strains. Here, this work directly compares two methods in different strains of L. plantarum: one utilizing a plasmid-encoded recombineering template and another utilizing an oligonucleotide donor and an inducible DNA recombinase. This comparison reveals one instance in which only the recombineering-template method generates desired edits and another instance in which only the oligo method generates desired edits. It is further found that both methods exhibit highly variable success editing the same site across multiple L. plantarum strains. Finally, failure modes are identified for the recombineering-template method, including a consistent genomic deletion and reversion of a point mutation in the recombineering template. This study therefore highlights surprising differences for Cas9-mediated genome editing between methods and related strains, arguing for the need for multiple, distinct methods when performing CRISPR-based editing in bacteria.

30154261	Rathayibacter toxicus is a species of Gram-positive, corynetoxin-producing bacteria that causes annual ryegrass toxicity, a disease often fatal to grazing animals. A phylogenomic approach was employed to model the evolution of R. toxicus to explain the low genetic diversity observed among isolates collected during a 30-year period of sampling in three regions of Australia, gain insight into the taxonomy of Rathayibacter, and provide a framework for studying these bacteria. Analyses of a data set of more than 100 sequenced Rathayibacter genomes indicated that Rathayibacter forms nine species-level groups. R. toxicus is the most genetically distant, and evidence suggested that this species experienced a dramatic event in its evolution. Its genome is significantly reduced in size but is colinear to those of sister species. Moreover, R. toxicus has low intergroup genomic diversity and almost no intragroup genomic diversity between ecologically separated isolates. R. toxicus is the only species of the genus that encodes a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) locus and that is known to host a bacteriophage parasite. The spacers, which represent a chronological history of infections, were characterized for information on past events. We propose a three-stage process that emphasizes the importance of the bacteriophage and CRISPR in the genome reduction and low genetic diversity of the R. toxicus species.IMPORTANCERathayibacter toxicus is a toxin-producing species found in Australia and is often fatal to grazing animals. The threat of introduction of the species into the United States led to its inclusion in the Federal Select Agent Program, which makes R. toxicus a highly regulated species. This work provides novel insights into the evolution of R. toxicusR. toxicus is the only species in the genus to have acquired a CRISPR adaptive immune system to protect against bacteriophages. Results suggest that coexistence with the bacteriophage NCPPB3778 led to the massive shrinkage of the R. toxicus genome, species divergence, and the maintenance of low genetic diversity in extant bacterial groups. This work contributes to an understanding of the evolution and ecology of an agriculturally important species of bacteria.

30152993	Synthetic biology has created oscillators, latches, logic gates, logarithmically linear circuits, and load drivers that have electronic analogs in living cells. The ubiquitous operational amplifier, which allows circuits to operate robustly and precisely has not been built with biomolecular parts. As in electronics, a biological operational-amplifier could greatly improve the predictability of circuits despite noise and variability, a problem that all cellular circuits face. Here, we show how to create a synthetic three-stage inducer-input operational amplifier with a fast CRISPR-based differential-input push-pull stage, a slow transcription-and-translation amplification stage, and a fast-enzymatic output stage. Our "Bio-OpAmp" uses only 5 proteins including dCas9. It expands the toolkit of fundamental analog circuits in synthetic biology and provides a simple circuit motif for robust and precise molecular homeostasis.

30150992	Hepatitis B virus (HBV) remains a major cause of hepatic disease that threatens human health worldwide. Type I IFN (IFN-I) therapy is an important therapeutic option for HBV patients. The antiviral effect of IFN is mainly mediated via upregulation of the expressions of the downstream IFN-stimulated genes. However, the mechanisms by which IFN induces ISG production and inhibits HBV replication are yet to be clarified. TRIM14 was recently reported as a key molecule in the IFN-signaling pathway that regulates IFN production in response to viral infection. In this study, we sought to understand the mechanisms by which IFN restricts HBV replication. We confirmed that TRIM14 is an ISG in the hepatic cells, and that the pattern-recognition receptor ligands polyI:C and polydAdT induce TRIM14 dependent on IFN-I production. In addition, IFN-I-activated STAT1 (but not STAT3) directly bound to the TRIM14 promoter and mediated the induction of TRIM14. Interestingly, TRIM14 played an important role in IFN-I-mediated inhibition of HBV, and the TRIM14 SPRY domain interacted with the C-terminal of HBx, which might block the role of HBx in facilitating HBV replication by inhibiting the formation of the Smc-HBx-DDB1 complex. Thus, our study clearly demonstrates that TRIM14 is a STAT1-dependent ISG, and that the IFN-I-TRIM14-HBx axis shows an alternative way to understand the mechanism by which IFN-I inhibits virus replication.

30148842	Insufficient or dysregulated energy metabolism may underlie diverse inherited and degenerative diseases, cancer, and even aging itself. ATP is the central energy carrier in cells, but critical pathways for regulating ATP levels are not systematically understood. We combined a pooled clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats interference (CRISPRi) library enriched for mitochondrial genes, a fluorescent biosensor, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) in a high-throughput genetic screen to assay ATP concentrations in live human cells. We identified genes not known to be involved in energy metabolism. Most mitochondrial ribosomal proteins are essential in maintaining ATP levels under respiratory conditions, and impaired respiration predicts poor growth. We also identified genes for which coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) supplementation rescued ATP deficits caused by knockdown. These included CoQ10 biosynthetic genes associated with human disease and a subset of genes not linked to CoQ10 biosynthesis, indicating that increasing CoQ10 can preserve ATP in specific genetic contexts. This screening paradigm reveals mechanisms of metabolic control and genetic defects responsive to energy-based therapies.

30142928	Infection by the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes respiratory illness and has a high mortality rate (~35%). The requirement for the virus to be manipulated in a biosafety level three (BSL-3) facility has impeded development of urgently-needed antiviral agents. Here, we established anovel mouse model by inserting human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4) into the Rosa26 locus using CRISPR/Cas9, resulting in global expression of the transgene in a genetically stable mouse line. The mice were highly susceptible to infection by MERS-CoV clinical strain hCoV-EMC, which induced severe diffuse pulmonary disease in the animals, and could also be infected by an optimized pseudotyped MERS-CoV. Administration of the neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, H111-1 and m336, as well as a fusion inhibitor peptide, HR2P-M2, protected mice from challenge with authentic and pseudotyped MERS-CoV. These results confirmed that the hDPP4-knockin mouse is a novel model for studies of MERS-CoV pathogenesis and anti-MERS-CoV antiviral agents in BSL-3 and BSL-2facilities, respectively.

30138555	Methods for making specific modifications to the genomes of living cells are powerful research tools. Two methods currently dominate, CRISPR and Cre recombinase. CRISPR has the advantage that it can act on unmodified target genes; Cre has the advantage of being available in drug-inducible versions, allowing temporal control, but it requires engineering ("floxing") of the target gene. Here, we have combined these advantages by constructing drug (tamoxifen/mifepristone)-inducible Cas9 and Cpf1 CRISPR effectors. We demonstrate their low background activity and robust activation with drugs, by using gRNAs to target them to TetR, in a cell carrying a Tet-repressed reporter gene. As well as being useful in their own right, the research tools generated here will pave the way to making further drug-inducible effector proteins.	A Dominguez-Monedero|JA Davies

30133783	It is evidenced that 20% of all tumors in humans are caused by oncoviruses, including human papilloma viruses, Epstein-Barr virus, Kaposi sarcoma virus, human polyomaviruses, human T-lymphotrophic virus-1, and hepatitis B and C viruses. Human immunodeficiency virus is also involved in carcinogenesis, although not directly, but by facilitating the infection of many oncoviruses through compromising the immune system. Being intracellular parasites with the property of establishing latency and integrating into the host genome, these viruses are a therapeutic challenge for biomedical researchers. Therefore, strategies able to target nucleotide sequences within episomal or integrated viral genomes are of prime importance in antiviral or anticancerous armamentarium. Recently, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) has emerged as a powerful genome editing tool. Standing out as a precise and efficient oncoviruses method, it has been extensively applied in recent experimental ventures in the field of molecular medicine, particularly in combating infections including tumor inducing viruses. This review is aimed at collating the experimental and clinical advances in CRISPR/Cas9 technology in terms of its applications against oncoviruses. Primarily, it will focus on the application of CRISPR/Cas9 in combating tumor viruses, types of mechanisms targeted, and the significant outcomes till date. The technical pitfalls of the CRISPR/Cas9 and the comparative approaches in evaluating this technique with respect to other available alternatives are also described briefly. Furthermore, the review also discussed the clinical aspects and the ethical, legal, and social issues associated with the use of CRISPR/Cas9.

30131569	The European honeybee (Apis mellifera L.) exhibits various social behaviors. The molecular and neural mechanisms underlying these behaviors have long been explored, but causal relations between genes or neurons and behaviors remain to be elucidated because effective gene manipulation methods in the honeybee have not been available until recently. We recently established a basic technology to produce mutant honeybee drones using CRISPR/Cas9. Here we produced mutant drones using CRISPR/Cas9 targeting mKast, which is preferentially expressed in a certain subtype of class I Kenyon cells that comprise the mushroom bodies in the honeybee brain. By immunoblot analysis, we showed that mKast protein expression was completely lost in the mutant drone heads. In addition, during the production process of homozygous mutant workers, we demonstrated that heterozygous mutant workers could be produced by artificial insemination of wild-type queens with the sperm of mutant drones, indicating that mKast mutant drones were sexually mature. These results demonstrate that mKast is dispensable for normal development and sexual maturation in drone honeybees, and allow us to proceed with the production of homozygous mutant workers for the analysis of a particular gene by gene knockout in the future.

30127453	Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common, progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by classical motor dysfunction and is associated with α-synuclein-immunopositive pathology and the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN). Several missense mutations in the α-synuclein gene SCNA have been identified as cause of inherited PD, providing a practical strategy to generate genetically modified animal models for PD research. Since minipigs share many physiological and anatomical similarities to humans, we proposed that genetically modified minipigs carrying PD-causing mutations can serve as an ideal model for PD research. In the present study, we attempted to model PD by generating Guangxi Bama minipigs with three PD-causing missense mutations (E46K, H50Q and G51D) in SCNA using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing combining with somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) technique. We successfully generated a total of eight SCNT-derived Guangxi Bama minipigs with the desired heterozygous SCNA mutations integrated into genome, and we also confirmed by DNA sequencing that these minipigs expressed mutant α-synuclein at the transcription level. However, immunohistochemical analysis was not able to detect PD-specific pathological changes such as α-synuclein-immunopositive pathology and loss of SN dopaminergic neurons in the gene-edited minipigs at 3 months of age. In summary, we successfully generated Guangxi Bama minipigs harboring three PD-casusing mutations (E46K, H50Q and G51D) in SCNA. As they continue to develop, these gene editing minipigs need to be regularly teseted for the presence of PD-like pathological features in order to validate the use of this large-animal model in PD research.

30126924	Autophagy maintains cellular homeostasis by targeting damaged organelles, pathogens, or misfolded protein aggregates for lysosomal degradation. The autophagic process is initiated by the formation of autophagosomes, which can selectively enclose cargo via autophagy cargo receptors. A machinery of well-characterized autophagy-related proteins orchestrates the biogenesis of autophagosomes; however, the origin of the required membranes is incompletely understood. Here, we have applied sensitized pooled CRISPR screens and identify the uncharacterized transmembrane protein TMEM41B as a novel regulator of autophagy. In the absence of TMEM41B, autophagosome biogenesis is stalled, LC3 accumulates at WIPI2- and DFCP1-positive isolation membranes, and lysosomal flux of autophagy cargo receptors and intracellular bacteria is impaired. In addition to defective autophagy, TMEM41B knockout cells display significantly enlarged lipid droplets and reduced mobilization and β-oxidation of fatty acids. Immunostaining and interaction proteomics data suggest that TMEM41B localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Taken together, we propose that TMEM41B is a novel ER-localized regulator of autophagosome biogenesis and lipid mobilization.

30126863	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR associated protein 9 (Cas9), i.e., CRISPR-Cas9, has been extensively used as a gene-editing technology during recent years. Unlike earlier technologies for gene editing or gene knockdown, such as zinc finger nucleases and RNA interference, CRISPR-Cas9 is comparably easy to use, affordable, and versatile. Recently, CRISPR-Cas9 has been applied in studies of drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) and for ADME model generation. To date, about 50 papers have been published describing in vitro or in vivo CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing of ADME and ADME-related genes. Twenty of these papers describe gene editing of clinically relevant genes, such as ATP-binding cassette drug transporters and cytochrome P450 drug-metabolizing enzymes. With CRISPR-Cas9, the ADME tool box has been substantially expanded. This new technology allows us to develop better and more predictive in vitro and in vivo ADME models and map previously underexplored ADME genes and gene families. In this mini-review, we give an overview of the CRISPR-Cas9 technology and summarize recent applications of CRISPR-Cas9 within the ADME field. We also speculate about future applications of CRISPR-Cas9 in ADME research.	M Karlgren|I Simoff|M Keiser|S Oswald|P Artursson
30126372	Reproducibility of hits from independent CRISPR or siRNA screens is poor. This is partly due to data normalization primarily addressing technical variability within independent screens, and not the technical differences between them.	We present "rscreenorm", a method that standardizes the functional data ranges between screens using assay controls, and subsequently performs a piecewise-linear normalization to make data distributions across all screens comparable. In simulation studies, rscreenorm reduces false positives. Using two multiple-cell lines siRNA screens, rscreenorm increased reproducibility between 27 and 62% for hits, and up to 5-fold for non-hits. Using publicly available CRISPR-Cas screen data, application of commonly used median centering yields merely 34% of overlapping hits, in contrast with rscreenorm yielding 84% of overlapping hits. Furthermore, rscreenorm yielded at most 8% discordant results, whilst median-centering yielded as much as 55%.	Rscreenorm yields more consistent results and keeps false positive rates under control, improving reproducibility of genetic screens data analysis from multiple cell lines.

30122537	All immune systems use precise target recognition to interrogate foreign invaders. During CRISPR-Cas immunity, prokaryotes capture short spacer sequences from infecting viruses and insert them into the CRISPR array. Transcription and processing of the CRISPR locus generate small RNAs containing the spacer and repeat sequences that guide Cas nucleases to cleave a complementary protospacer in the invading nucleic acids. In most CRISPR systems, sequences flanking the protospacer drastically affect cleavage. Here, we investigated the target requirements of the recently discovered RNA-targeting type VI-A CRISPR-Cas system in its natural host, Listeria seeligeri. We discovered that target RNAs with extended complementarity between the protospacer flanking sequence and the repeat sequence of the guide RNA are not cleaved by the type VI-A nuclease Cas13, neither in vivo nor in vitro. These findings establish fundamental rules for the design of Cas13-based technologies and provide a mechanism for preventing self-targeting in type VI-A systems.	AJ Meeske|LA Marraffini

30117419	Genome editing technologies (GETs) can precisely alter the genomic sequences and modify the genetic information at the target site of an organism. Since the beginning of the 21st century, the GETs, including zinc finger nucleases (ZFN), transcription-activating-like receptor factor (TALEN), and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/Cas endonucleases (CRISPR/Cas), have been successively developed. The GETs can easily engineer the targeted genomic site of animals to exhibit a desired phenotype(s), thereby providing valuable tools in biomedical research. The pigs are closely related to human, in terms of similarities in physiological properties and pathogenic characters. Thus, pigs have been used as important animal models in studies of human disease, xenotransplantation, and humanized organs regeneration. In this review, we summarize the development of the three GETs, research progress of genome-edited pigs as disease models and organ donors for xenotransplantation, and the prospects of their applications in future biomedical research.

30114933	GUIDE-seq was developed to detect CRISPR/Cas9 off-target. However, as originally reported, it was associated with a high level of nonspecific amplification. In an attempt to improve it, we developed target-enriched GUIDE-seq (TEG-seq). The sensitivity level reached 0.1-10 reads-per-million depending on the NGS platform used, which was equivalent to 0.0002-1% measured by Targeted Amplicon-seq. Application of TEG-seq was demonstrated for the evaluation of various Cas9/gRNA configurations, which suggests delivery of Cas9/gRNA ribonucleoprotein results in significantly fewer off-targets than Cas9/gRNA plasmid. TEG-seq was also applied to 22 gRNAs with relatively high in silico ranking score that targeted the biological relevant SNPs. The result indicated the initial selection of gRNAs with high score is important, although it cannot exclude the possibility of off-target.	PZ Tang|B Ding|L Peng|V Mozhayskiy|J Potter|JD Chesnut
30113801	Nucleic acid detection is an important method for pathogen identification but can be expensive, have variable sensitivity and specificity, and require substantial infrastructure. Two new methods capitalize on unexpected in vitro properties of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) effectors, turning activated nucleases into intrinsic amplifiers of a specific nucleic-acid binding event. These effectors are coupled with a variety of reporters and used in tandem with existing isothermal amplification methods to produce sensitive, sequence-specific pathogen identification in multiple field-deployable formats. While still in their infancy, these modular CRISPR-based methods have the potential to transform pathogen identification and other aspects of infectious disease diagnostics.

30111865	Resolving functions of closely linked genes is challenging or nearly impossible with classical genetic tools. Four members of the Catharanthus roseus receptor-like kinase 1-like (CrRLK1L) family are clustered on Arabidopsis chromosome five. To resolve the potentially redundant functions of this subclass of CrRLK1Ls named MEDOS1 to 4 (MDS1 to 4), we generated a single CRISPR/Cas9 transformation vector using a Golden Gate based cloning system to target all four genes simultaneously. We introduce single mutations within and deletions between MDS genes as well as knock-outs of the whole 11 kb gene cluster. The large MDS cluster deletion was inherited in up to 25% of plants lacking the CRISPR/Cas9 construct in the T2 generation. In contrast to described phenotypes of already characterized CrRLK1L mutants, quadruple mds knock-outs were fully fertile, developed normal root hairs and trichomes and responded to pharmacological inhibition of cellulose biosynthesis similar to wildtype. Recently, we demonstrated the role of four CrRLK1L in growth adaptation to metal ion stress. Here we show the involvement of MDS genes in response to Ni2+ during hypocotyl elongation and to Cd2+ and Zn2+ during root growth. Our finding supports the model of an organ specific network of positively and negatively acting CrRLK1Ls.

30107853	CRISPR gene editing has revolutionized biomedicine and biotechnology by providing a simple means to engineer genes through targeted double-strand breaks in the genomic DNA of living cells. However, given the stochasticity of cellular DNA repair mechanisms and the potential for off-target mutations, technologies capable of introducing targeted changes with increased precision, such as single-base editors, are preferred. We present a versatile method termed CRISPR-SKIP that utilizes cytidine deaminase single-base editors to program exon skipping by mutating target DNA bases within splice acceptor sites. Given its simplicity and precision, CRISPR-SKIP will be broadly applicable in gene therapy and synthetic biology.	M Gapinske|A Luu|J Winter|WS Woods|KA Kostan|N Shiva|JS Song|P Perez-Pinera
30107450	Prokaryotes use primed CRISPR adaptation to update their memory bank of spacers against invading genetic elements that have escaped CRISPR interference through mutations in their protospacer target site. We previously observed a trend that nucleotide-dependent mismatches between crRNA and the protospacer strongly influence the efficiency of primed CRISPR adaptation. Here we show that guanine-substitutions in the target strand of the protospacer are highly detrimental to CRISPR interference and interference-dependent priming, while cytosine-substitutions are more readily tolerated. Furthermore, we show that this effect is based on strongly decreased binding affinity of the effector complex Cascade for guanine-mismatched targets, while cytosine-mismatched targets only minimally affect target DNA binding. Structural modeling of Cascade-bound targets with mismatches shows that steric clashes of mismatched guanines lead to unfavorable conformations of the RNA-DNA duplex. This effect has strong implications for the natural selection of target site mutations that lead to effective escape from type I CRISPR-Cas systems.

30104136	Despite the unparalleled therapeutic promise of genome editing, its curative power is currently limited by the substantial difficulty in delivering DNA-cutting enzymes to the cells in need of correction.

30098338	Cell-type specific gene expression programs are tightly linked to epigenetic modifications on DNA and histone proteins. Here, we used a novel CRISPR-based epigenome editing approach to control gene expression spatially and temporally. We show that targeting dCas9-p300 complex to distal non-regulatory genomic regions reprograms the chromatin state of these regions into enhancer-like elements. Notably, through controlling the spatial distance of these induced enhancers (i-Enhancer) to the promoter, the gene expression amplitude can be tightly regulated. To better control the temporal persistence of induced gene expression, we integrated the auxin-inducible degron technology with CRISPR tools. This approach allows rapid depletion of the dCas9-fused epigenome modifier complex from the target site and enables temporal control over gene expression regulation. Using this tool, we investigated the temporal persistence of a locally edited epigenetic mark and its functional consequences. The tools and approaches presented here will allow novel insights into the mechanism of epigenetic memory and gene regulation from distal regulatory sites.

30096312	Recent sequencing analyses have shed light on heterogeneous patterns of genomic aberrations in human gastric cancers (GCs). To explore how individual genetic events translate into cancer phenotypes, we established a biological library consisting of genetically engineered gastric organoids carrying various GC mutations and 37 patient-derived organoid lines, including rare genomically stable GCs. Phenotype analyses of GC organoids revealed divergent genetic and epigenetic routes to gain Wnt and R-spondin niche independency. An unbiased phenotype-based genetic screening identified a significant association between CDH1/TP53 compound mutations and the R-spondin independency that was functionally validated by CRISPR-based knockout. Xenografting of GC organoids further established the feasibility of Wnt-targeting therapy for Wnt-dependent GCs. Our results collectively demonstrate that multifaceted genetic abnormalities render human GCs independent of the stem cell niche and highlight the validity of the genotype-phenotype screening strategy in gaining deeper understanding of human cancers.

30096306	Viruses have evolved inhibitors to counteract the CRISPR immune response, but they are not fully potent and need some time to be expressed after the beginning of infection.

30093504	A study in four cell lines concludes that CRISPR/Cas9 editing causes unanticipated genomic alterations, including large deletions, translocations, and insertions. Some of these changes could be the first hits that cause cells to eventually become neoplastic.
30091705	We generated two new genetic tools to efficiently tag genes in Drosophila. The first, Double Header (DH) utilizes intronic MiMIC/CRIMIC insertions to generate artificial exons for GFP mediated protein trapping or T2A-GAL4 gene trapping in vivo based on Cre recombinase to avoid embryo injections. DH significantly increases integration efficiency compared to previous strategies and faithfully reports the expression pattern of genes and proteins. The second technique targets genes lacking coding introns using a two-step cassette exchange. First, we replace the endogenous gene with an excisable compact dominant marker using CRISPR making a null allele. Second, the insertion is replaced with a protein::tag cassette. This sequential manipulation allows the generation of numerous tagged alleles or insertion of other DNA fragments that facilitates multiple downstream applications. Both techniques allow precise gene manipulation and facilitate detection of gene expression, protein localization and assessment of protein function, as well as numerous other applications.

30089886	Mutations within the KRAS oncogene are associated with the proliferation of various cancers. Therapeutic approaches for treating cancers with such mutations have focused on targeting the downstream protein effectors of KRAS. However, to date, no approved treatment has targeted the mutated KRAS oncogene directly. Presently, we used the selectivity of the CRISPR/Cas9 system to directly target mutated KRAS alleles. We designed single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) to target two specific single-nucleotide missense mutations on KRAS codon-12 located in the seed region adjacent to a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). Lentiviral transduction of Cas9 and the sgRNAs into cancer cells with respective KRAS mutations resulted in high frequency of indels in the seed region. Indel-associated disruption of the mutant KRAS alleles correlated with reduced viability of the cancer cells. The results indicate that CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing can potentially be used for the treatment of cancer patients, specifically those with oncogenic KRAS mutations.

30089752	The CRISPR/Cas9 system can efficiently introduce biallelic mutations in ES cells (ESCs), and its application with fluorescently-tagged ESCs enables phenotype analysis in chimeric mice. We have utilized ESCs that express EGFP in the cytosol and acrosome [EGR-G101 129S2 × (CAG/Acr-EGFP) B6] in previous studies; however, the EGFP signal in the sperm cytosol is weak and the signal in the acrosome is lost after the acrosome reaction, precluding analysis between wild type and ESC derived spermatozoa. In this study, we established an ESC line from RBGS (Red Body Green Sperm) transgenic mice [B6D2-Tg (CAG/Su9-DsRed2, Acr3-EGFP) RBGS002Osb] whose spermatozoa exhibit green fluorescence in the acrosome and red fluorescence in the mitochondria within the flagellar midpiece that is retained after the acrosome reaction. We utilized these new ESCs to analyze HYDIN, which is reported to function in sperm motility in humans. Analysis of Hydin-disrupted spermatozoa in mice is difficult as Hydin-mutant mice (hy3) die within 3 weeks, before sexual maturation, due to hydrocephaly. To circumvent the early lethality of the whole-body knockout, we disrupted Hydin in RBGS-ESCs and generated chimeric mice, which survived into sexual maturity. Hydin-disrupted spermatozoa obtained from the chimeric mice possessed short tails and were immotile. When we injected Hydin-disrupted spermatozoa into oocytes, heterozygous pups were obtained, which suggests that the genome of Hydin-disrupted spermatozoa can produce viable pups. Consequently, RBGS-ESCs can be a useful tool for screening and analysis of male-fertility related genes in chimeric mice.	S Oura|H Miyata|T Noda|K Shimada|T Matsumura|A Morohoshi|A Isotani|M Ikawa
30086204	Tragopogon (Asteraceae) is an excellent natural system for studies of recent polyploidy. Development of an efficient CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing platform in Tragopogon will facilitate novel studies of the genetic consequences of polyploidy. Here, we report our initial results of developing CRISPR/Cas9 in Tragopogon. We have established a feasible tissue culture and transformation protocol for Tragopogon. Through protoplast transient assays, use of the TragCRISPR system (i.e. the CRISPR/Cas9 system adapted for Tragopogon) was capable of introducing site-specific mutations in Tragopogon protoplasts. Agrobacterium-mediated transformation with Cas9-sgRNA constructs targeting the phytoene desaturase gene (TraPDS) was implemented in this model polyploid system. Sequencing of PCR amplicons from the target regions indicated simultaneous mutations of two alleles and four alleles of TraPDS in albino shoots from Tragopogon porrifolius (2x) and Tragopogon mirus (4x), respectively. The average proportions of successfully transformed calli with the albino phenotype were 87% and 78% in the diploid and polyploid, respectively. This appears to be the first demonstration of CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing in any naturally formed neopolyploid system. Although a more efficient tissue culture system should be developed in Tragopogon, application of a robust CRISPR/Cas9 system will permit unique studies of biased fractionation, the gene-balance hypothesis and cytonuclear interactions in polyploids. In addition, the CRISPR/Cas9 platform enables investigations of those genes involved in phenotypic changes in polyploids and will also facilitate novel functional biology studies in Asteraceae. Our workflow provides a guide for applying CRISPR/Cas9 to other nongenetic model plant systems.	S Shan|EV Mavrodiev|R Li|Z Zhang|BA Hauser|PS Soltis|DE Soltis|B Yang
30081040	CRISPR-Cpf1 is a type V CRISPR system that has recently been exploited for genome engineering purposes. Compared to the well-known Streptococcus pyogenes CRISPR-Cas9 system, the effector protein Cpf1 recognizes T-rich protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) instead of G-rich PAM (used by CRISPR-Cas9), which could offer a substantial expansion of the existing genetic toolbox for genome editing. In this study, we report the implementation of the Acidaminococcus sp. Cpf1 (AsCpf1) for markerless genome engineering in Clostridium beijerinckii, a prominent species for biosolvent production through the well-known Acetone-Butanol-Ethanol (ABE) pathway. A lactose inducible promoter was used to control the expression of AsCpf1 to decrease its toxicity, while a constitutive small RNA promoter was employed to drive the expression of pre-crRNA. A One-Step-Assembly (OSA) approach was employed to construct the CRISPR-Cpf1-based vector in one single step, which simplified and streamlined the plasmid construction process. Using the customized CRISPR-Cpf1 system, we successfully deleted spo0A and pta genes in C. beijerinckii, with an editing efficiency of up to 100%. Altogether, our results demonstrated the easy programmability and high efficiency of the CRISPR-Cpf1 system for versatile genome engineering purposes. This study provides valuable guidance and essential references for repurposing the CRISPR-Cpf1 system for genome engineering in other microorganisms.	J Zhang|W Hong|W Zong|P Wang|Y Wang
30078724	Class 2 CRISPR-Cas nucleases are programmable genome editing tools with promising applications in human health and disease. However, DNA cleavage at off-target sites that resemble the target sequence is a pervasive problem that remains poorly understood mechanistically. Here, we use quantitative kinetics to dissect the reaction steps of DNA targeting by Acidaminococcus sp Cas12a (also known as Cpf1). We show that Cas12a binds DNA tightly in two kinetically separable steps. Protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) recognition is followed by rate-limiting R-loop propagation, leading to inevitable DNA cleavage of both strands. Despite functionally irreversible binding, Cas12a discriminates strongly against mismatches along most of the DNA target sequence. This result implies substantial reversibility during R-loop formation-a late transition state-and defies common descriptions of a "seed" region. Our results provide a quantitative basis for the DNA cleavage patterns measured in vivo and observations of greater reported target specificity for Cas12a than for the Cas9 nuclease.

30078067	Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR or more precisely CRISPR-Cas) system has proven to be a highly efficient and simple tool for achieving site-specific genome modifications in comparison to Zinc Finger Nucleases (ZFNs) and Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases (TALENs). The discovery of bacterial defense system that uses RNA-guided DNA cleaving enzymes for producing double-strand breaks along CRISPR has provided an exciting alternative to ZFNs and TALENs for gene editing & regulation, as the CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins remain the same for different gene targets and only the short sequence of the guide RNA needs to be changed to redirect the site-specific cleavage. Therefore, in recent years the CRISPR-Cas system has emerged as a revolutionary engineering tool for carrying out precise and controlled genetic modifications in many microbes such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Lactobacillus reuteri, Clostridium beijerinckii, Streptococcus pneumonia, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Though, concerns about CRISPR-Cas effectiveness in interlinked gene modifications and off-target effects need to be addressed. Nevertheless, it holds a great potential to speed up the pace of gene function discovery by interacting with previously intractable organisms and by raising the extent of genetic screens. Therefore, the potential applications of this system in microbial adaptive immune system, genome editing, gene regulations, functional genomics & biosynthesis along ethical issues, and possible harmful effects have been reviewed.

30077009	CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) system is the convenient tool for targeted-gene activation, it has been developed and combined with a lighting-based system that can control transcription initiation spatially and temporally by utilizing photoreceptor derived from plant Arabidopsis thaliana. A blue light photoreceptor the Cryptochrome 2 (CRY2), and its binding partner CIB1 will dimerize by exposure to the blue light and it has been applied to human cells. However, the application of a combination of these two systems to zebrafish cell is still not explored. We performed zebrafish gene activation using p65 and VP64 activators in the zebrafish cells (ZF4). Our study demonstrated that we have successfully controlled the transcription level of ASCL1a, BCL6a, and HSP70 genes using blue light-activated CRISPR activation system. The result showed that using this system, mRNA level expression of ASCL1a, BCL6a, and HSP70 genes increased after irradiated under blue light for several hours and significantly different to those which treated in the dark.

30076867	The recent availability of highly adaptable engineered nucleic acid binding proteins has brought about a revolution in the genome-editing field. Now, several studies have harnessed these Zinc-Finger-based, Transcription Activator-like Effector (TALE)-based, and Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-based programmable DNA and RNA-binding proteins to develop very specific diagnostic platforms to detect pathogen's nucleic acids, with sensitivities that go down to single molecule resolution. Particularly, the very recent descriptions of novel CRISPR associated enzymes with different target specificities and activities, including Cas13a (C2c2), Cas12a (Cpf1) and Csm6, have subsided the development of methods such as the DNA Endonuclease-Targeted CRISPR Trans Reporter (DETECTR) and the Specific High-Sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter UnLOCKing (SHERLOCK). The reliabilities of these new diagnostic technologies have already been demonstrated for detection of nucleic acids from classical bacterial pathogens and also for emerging viral threats, including Zika virus. Besides, efficient genotyping capabilities have been reported for some technologies, that were shown, for instance, to be able to differentiate between human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18. Recent advancements that include improvements in multiplexing and quantitative capabilities, and instrument-free detection of results will potentially leverage the introduction of these new technologies to bacterial and viral detection at the point-of-care.

30070695	The noradrenergic (NA) system of vertebrates is implicated in learning, memory, arousal, and neuroinflammatory responses, but is difficult to access experimentally. Small and optically transparent, larval zebrafish offer the prospect of exploration of NA structure and function in an intact animal. We made multiple transgenic zebrafish lines using the CRISPR/Cas9 system to insert fluorescent reporters upstream of slc6a2, the norepinephrine transporter gene. These lines faithfully express reporters in NA cell populations, including the locus coeruleus (LC), which contains only about 14 total neurons. We used the lines in combination with two-photon microscopy to explore the structure and projections of the NA system in the context of the columnar organization of cell types in the zebrafish hindbrain. We found robust alignment of NA projections with glutamatergic neurotransmitter stripes in some hindbrain segments, suggesting orderly relations to neuronal cell types early in life. We also quantified neurite density in the rostral spinal cord in individual larvae with as much as 100% difference in the number of LC neurons, and found no correlation between neuronal number in the LC and projection density in the rostral spinal cord. Finally, using light sheet microscopy, we performed bilateral calcium imaging of the entire LC. We found that large-amplitude calcium responses were evident in all LC neurons and showed bilateral synchrony, whereas small-amplitude events were more likely to show interhemispheric asynchrony, supporting the potential for targeted LC neuromodulation. Our observations and new transgenic lines set the stage for a deeper understanding of the NA system.	MJ Farrar|KE Kolkman|JR Fetcho
30065072	Rare diseases are collectively common and often extremely debilitating. Following the emergence of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, the variants underpinning rare genetic disorders are being unearthed at an accelerating rate. However, many rare conditions lack effective treatments due to their poorly understood pathophysiology. There is therefore a growing demand for the development of novel experimental models of rare genetic diseases, so that potentially causative variants can be validated, pathogenic mechanisms can be investigated and therapeutic targets can be identified. Animal models of rare diseases need to be genetically and physiologically similar to humans, and well-suited to large-scale experimental manipulation, considering the vast number of novel variants that are being identified through NGS. The zebrafish has emerged as a popular model system for investigating these variants, combining conserved vertebrate characteristics with a capacity for large-scale phenotypic and therapeutic screening. In this review, we aim to highlight the unique advantages of the zebrafish over other in vivo model systems for the large-scale study of rare genetic variants. We will also consider the generation of zebrafish disease models from a practical standpoint, by discussing how genome editing technologies, particularly the recently developed clustered regularly interspaced repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 system, can be used to model rare pathogenic variants in zebrafish. Finally, we will review examples in the literature where zebrafish models have played a pivotal role in confirming variant causality and revealing the underlying mechanisms of rare diseases, often with wider implications for our understanding of human biology.

30054595	CRISPR-Cas genome editing creates targeted DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) that are processed by cellular repair pathways, including the incorporation of exogenous DNA via single-strand template repair (SSTR). To determine the genetic basis of SSTR in human cells, we developed a coupled inhibition-cutting system capable of interrogating multiple editing outcomes in the context of thousands of individual gene knockdowns. We found that human Cas9-induced SSTR requires the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway, which is normally implicated in interstrand cross-link repair. The FA pathway does not directly impact error-prone, non-homologous end joining, but instead diverts repair toward SSTR. Furthermore, FANCD2 protein localizes to Cas9-induced DSBs, indicating a direct role in regulating genome editing. Since FA is itself a genetic disease, these data imply that patient genotype and/or transcriptome may impact the effectiveness of gene editing treatments and that treatments biased toward FA repair pathways could have therapeutic value.

30054476	Temozolomide (TMZ) was used for the treatment of glioblastoma (GBM) for over a decade, but its treatment benefits are limited by acquired resistance, a process that remains incompletely understood. Here we report that an enhancer, located between the promoters of marker of proliferation Ki67 (MKI67) and O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) genes, is activated in TMZ-resistant patient-derived xenograft (PDX) lines and recurrent tumor samples. Activation of the enhancer correlates with increased MGMT expression, a major known mechanism for TMZ resistance. We show that forced activation of the enhancer in cell lines with low MGMT expression results in elevated MGMT expression. Deletion of this enhancer in cell lines with high MGMT expression leads to a dramatic reduction of MGMT and a lesser extent of Ki67 expression, increased TMZ sensitivity, and impaired proliferation. Together, these studies uncover a mechanism that regulates MGMT expression, confers TMZ resistance, and potentially regulates tumor proliferation.

30054474	Therapeutic genome editing with Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 (SaCas9) requires a rigorous understanding of its potential off-target activity in the human genome. Here we report a high-throughput screening approach to measure SaCas9 genome editing variation in human cells across a large repertoire of 88,692 single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) paired with matched or mismatched target sites in a synthetic cassette. We incorporate randomized barcodes that enable whitelisting of correctly synthesized molecules for further downstream analysis, in order to circumvent the limitation of oligonucleotide synthesis errors. We find SaCas9 sgRNAs with 21-mer or 22-mer spacer sequences are generally more active, although high efficiency 20-mer spacers are markedly less tolerant of mismatches. Using this dataset, we developed an SaCas9 specificity model that performs robustly in ranking off-target sites.

30047111	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) are a genetic locus of prokaryotes and contain highly conserved direct repeats, spacers, and CRISPR-associated genes. Spacers in CRISPRs are known as adaptive immune markers and reveal what types of phage or foreign DNA have been introduced in the past. The primary objective of this study was to analyze spacer sequences in CRISPR arrays of 15 Salmonella enterica subspecies and to determine if Salmonella CRISPRs are indeed involved in resistance to foreign DNAs. Using a bioinformatics algorithm, the CRISPR arrays of 15 subspecies of S. enterica were predicted. The transformation efficiencies of the wild-type and mutant strains lacking a space were determined using the plasmid harboring the same sequences with the space. Analysis of the CRISPR arrays indicated that S. Typhimurium encoded three possible CRISPR regions in the genome. Notably, 48 or 55 spacers were predicted in the genomes of S. Typhimurium 14028 and LT2 strains, respectively, and 39 were precisely identical. To confirm this prediction, the predicted CRISPR regions of S. Typhimurium 14028 were sequenced using the specific primers. Interestingly, a homology search of individual spacers found that the 2nd spacer of CRISPR 2 was nearly identical to a partial genome region of phage FSL SP-016. The mutant strain showed two to threefold increased transformation efficiency compared to that of the wild-type strain. These results demonstrate that the spacer sequence is dependent on genetic relations, especially for adaptive immunity against phage or foreign DNAs.	JN Kim
30046034	CRISPR-Cas systems are bacterial anti-viral systems, and bacterial viruses (bacteriophages, phages) can carry anti-CRISPR (Acr) proteins to evade that immunity. Acrs can also fine-tune the activity of CRISPR-based genome-editing tools. While Acrs are prevalent in phages capable of lying dormant in a CRISPR-carrying host, their orthologs have been observed only infrequently in virulent phages. Here we identify AcrIIA6, an Acr encoded in 33% of virulent Streptococcus thermophilus phage genomes. The X-ray structure of AcrIIA6 displays some features unique to this Acr family. We compare the activity of AcrIIA6 to those of other Acrs, including AcrIIA5 (also from S. thermophilus phages), and characterize their effectiveness against a range of CRISPR-Cas systems. Finally, we demonstrate that both Acr families from S. thermophilus phages inhibit Cas9-mediated genome editing of human cells.

30040285	CRISPR/Cas gene editing makes it much easier to make targeted changes in the DNA of human cells than other forms of gene therapy. This revolutionary technology offers spectacular opportunities to study gene functions; the clinical consequences of gene variations in patients can be determined much faster. The efficacy and accuracy of CRISPR/Cas is so impressive that a breakthrough to therapeutic applications is approaching fast. CRISPR/Cas is already being used in immunotherapy against cancer, and trials for monogenetic blood disorders, such as beta-thalassemia, have been scheduled. However, broad clinical implementation of CRISPR/Cas is not feasible yet, due to off-target DNA changes that may occur as a by-product. Particularly in case of in-vivo applications there are therapeutic challenges. For gene editing in human embryos, technical shortcomings and open ethical issues need to be addressed. Gene-editing therapy for serious disorders with transplantable cell types, and therefore the option of verification of "CRISPRed" cells, is seen as a possible first application within the regular healthcare system.

30039929	Mycobacterium smegmatis is an important model strain of Mycobacterium for scientific study because it is non-pathogenic and grows rapidly. However, research is limited by the low efficiency and time-consuming nature of existing genome editing tools. Although the Streptococcus pyogenes CRISPR-Cas9 system is widely used in bacterial genome editing, it cannot be introduced into M. smegmatis because of its toxicity. The authors test 14 different Cas effector proteins in M. smegmatis. Cas9 (TdCas9_m) from Treponema denticola, Cas9 (NmCas9) from Neisseria meningitidis, and Corynebacterium glutamicum codon-optimized Cpf1 (FnCpf1_cg) from Francisella tularensis do not affect cell growth. The numbers of transformant plasmids expressing TdCas9_m, NmCas9, or FnCpf1_cg, and guide RNAs (gRNA) targeting ku(MSMEG_5580), ligD(MSMEG_6301), pta(MSMEG_0783), or ackA(MSMEG_0784) decreases by about 10-, 10-, or 100-fold, respectively, compared with plasmids expressing only the Cas effector proteins. Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is detected only in the CRISPR-FnCpf1_cg system. The one-plasmid-based, CRISPR-FnCpf1-assisted NHEJ system enables N iterative rounds of genome editing in 7N + 2 days, with an editing efficiency up to 70%; thus, this system should greatly reduce the necessary genome manipulation time for M. smegmatis.

30038015	Features of the CRISPR-Cas system, in which bacteria integrate small segments of phage genome (spacers) into their DNA to neutralize future attacks, suggest that its effect is not limited to individual bacteria but may control the fate and structure of whole populations. Emphasizing the population-level impact of the CRISPR-Cas system, recent experiments show that some bacteria regulate CRISPR-associated genes via the quorum sensing (QS) pathway. Here we present a model that shows that from the highly stochastic dynamics of individual spacers under QS control emerges a rank-abundance distribution of spacers that is time invariant, a surprising prediction that we test with dynamic spacer-tracking data from literature. This distribution depends on the state of the competing phage-bacteria population, which due to QS-based regulation may coexist in multiple stable states that vary significantly in their phage-to-bacterium ratio, a widely used ecological measure to characterize microbial systems.

30036575	Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a pathogenic bacterial species that causes infections and diseases in both plants and animals, including several human diseases, especially in immune-compromised patients, and many hospital-acquired infections. Given that P. aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen, the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance makes it difficult to treat and eradicate. Antimicrobial resistance in P. aeruginosa is categorized as intrinsic, acquired, or adaptive. Here, we different aspects of resistance and pathogenicity in P. aeruginosa, such as the role of outer membrane proteins, transcriptional regulators, efflux pumps, enzymes, and biofilms in antimicrobial resistance. We also highlight quorum-sensing (QS) genes, their protein secretion, and role in pathogenicity; different QS inhibitors; and the influence of QS on the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas system and virulence factor production.

30033371	Chromosomal rearrangements including large DNA-fragment inversions, deletions, and duplications by Cas9 with paired sgRNAs are important to investigate genome structural variations and developmental gene regulation, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms. Here, we report that disrupting CtIP or FANCD2, which have roles in alternative non-homologous end joining, enhances precise DNA-fragment deletion. By analyzing the inserted nucleotides at the junctions of DNA-fragment editing of deletions, inversions, and duplications and characterizing the cleaved products, we find that Cas9 endonucleolytically cleaves the noncomplementary strand with a flexible scissile profile upstream of the -3 position of the PAM site in vivo and in vitro, generating double-strand break ends with 5' overhangs of 1-3 nucleotides. Moreover, we find that engineered Cas9 nucleases have distinct cleavage profiles. Finally, Cas9-mediated nucleotide insertions are nonrandom and are equal to the combined sequences upstream of both PAM sites with predicted frequencies. Thus, precise and predictable DNA-fragment editing could be achieved by perturbing DNA repair genes and using appropriate PAM configurations.	J Shou|J Li|Y Liu|Q Wu
30033366	Seminal yeast studies have established the value of comprehensively mapping genetic interactions (GIs) for inferring gene function. Efforts in human cells using focused gene sets underscore the utility of this approach, but the feasibility of generating large-scale, diverse human GI maps remains unresolved. We developed a CRISPR interference platform for large-scale quantitative mapping of human GIs. We systematically perturbed 222,784 gene pairs in two cancer cell lines. The resultant maps cluster functionally related genes, assigning function to poorly characterized genes, including TMEM261, a new electron transport chain component. Individual GIs pinpoint unexpected relationships between pathways, exemplified by a specific cholesterol biosynthesis intermediate whose accumulation induces deoxynucleotide depletion, causing replicative DNA damage and a synthetic-lethal interaction with the ATR/9-1-1 DNA repair pathway. Our map provides a broad resource, establishes GI maps as a high-resolution tool for dissecting gene function, and serves as a blueprint for mapping the genetic landscape of human cells.

30030848	The use of epigenome editing is set to expand our knowledge of how epigenetic landscapes facilitate gene expression capacity within a given cell. As epigenetic landscape profiling in health and disease becomes more commonplace, so does the requirement to assess the functional impact that particular regulatory domains and DNA methylation profiles have upon gene expression capacity. That functional assessment is particularly pertinent when analysing epigenomes in disease states where the reversible nature of histone and DNA modification might yield plausible therapeutic targets. In this review we discuss first the nature of the epigenetic landscape, secondly the types of factors that deposit and erase the various modifications, consider how modifications transduce their signals, and lastly address current tools for experimental epigenome editing with particular emphasis on the immune system.

30030786	The interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) system is an immune system widely distributed in prokaryotes, resisting the invasion of the foreign mobile genetic elements like phages or plasmids. In this study, we present the comparative analysis of 182 CRISPR loci found in 46 publicly available complete genome sequences of Streptomyces. Overall, nine direct repeats (DRs) groups are identified while all the 2104 spacers are divided into three main groups according to the multiple sequence alignment. Only 11 spacers are identical with parts of 10 plasmid sequences, which indicates a possible origin. The cas gene clusters near the CRISPR arrays are found to mainly belong to the I-E subtype. These CRISPR loci might play an important role in the genome evolution of Streptomyces.	J Zhang|X Li|Z Deng|HY Ou
30028664	A monooxygenase-encoding gene (Mono) is located in the hypocrellin gene cluster of Shiraia sp. SUPER-H168 and was targeted by a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 system. The ΔMono mutant abolished hypocrellin production, whereas the ΔMono complement mutant restored hypocrellin production. Relative expression levels of the Mono and its adjacent genes were abolished in the ΔMono mutant compared with the wild-type strain. These results indicate the essential role of Mono in hypocrellin biosynthesis. The Mono gene of Shiraia bambusicola was further expressed in Pichia pastoris and salicylate monooxygenase activity was detected, which suggested that this monooxygenase has the ability to catalyse decarboxylative hydroxylation. The relative growth ratio of the ΔMono mutant was significantly improved compared with the wild-type strain. In contrast to the wild-type strain, the ΔMono mutant also represented excellent oxidative stress tolerance after exposure to high concentrations of H2O2 (16 mM) based on the increasing activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase. These results suggest that ΔMono mutants could be used as microbial cell factories to produce metabolites that will cause oxidative stress. This study also enhances our understanding of hypocrellin biosynthesis and opens an avenue for decoding the hypocrellin pathway.	H Deng|R Gao|X Liao|Y Cai
30027767	The CRISPR-Cas9, a part of the defence mechanism from bacteria, has rapidly become the simplest, fastest and the most precise genome-editing tool available. The therapeutic applications of CRISPR are boundless: correction of mutations in several disorders, inactivation of oncogenes and viral oncoproteins, and activation of tumor suppressor genes. In this review, we expose recent advances concerning animal models of cancer that use CRISPR-Cas9, addressing also the current efforts to develop CRISPR-Cas9-based therapies, focusing on proof-of-concept studies. Finally, the review exposes some of the main challenges that this genome-editing tool faces. The key issue remains: does CRISPR-Cas9 have real potential for therapeutic application or will it just remain a wonderful research tool?	D Estêvão|N Rios Costa|RG da Costa|R Medeiros

30026308	Spermatogenesis is a tightly regulated process involving germ cell-specific and germ cell-predominant genes. Here we investigate a novel germ cell-specific gene, Spatc1l (spermatogenesis and centriole associated 1 like). Expression analyses show that SPATC1L is expressed in mouse and human testes. We find that mouse SPATC1L localizes to the neck region in testicular sperm. Moreover, SPATC1L associates with the regulatory subunit of protein kinase A (PKA). Using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome engineering, we generate mice lacking SPATC1L. Disruption of Spatc1l in mice leads to male sterility owing to separation of sperm heads from tails. The lack of SPATC1L is associated with a reduction in PKA activity in testicular sperm, and we identify capping protein muscle Z-line beta as a candidate target of phosphorylation by PKA in testis. Taken together, our results implicate the SPATC1L-PKA complex in maintaining the stability of the sperm head-tail junction, thereby revealing a new molecular basis for sperm head-tail integrity.

30026278	Objective- Atherosclerosis studies in Ldlr knockout mice require breeding to homozygosity and congenic status on C57BL6/J background, a process that is both time and resource intensive. We aimed to develop a new method for generating atherosclerosis through somatic deletion of Ldlr in livers of adult mice. Approach and Results- Overexpression of PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) is currently used to study atherosclerosis, which promotes degradation of LDLR (low-density lipoprotein receptor) in the liver. We sought to determine whether CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-associated 9) could also be used to generate atherosclerosis through genetic disruption of Ldlr in adult mice. We engineered adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors expressing Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 and a guide RNA targeting the Ldlr gene (AAV-CRISPR). Both male and female mice received either (1) saline, (2) AAV-CRISPR, or (3) AAV-hPCSK9 (human PCSK9)-D374Y. A fourth group of germline Ldlr-KO mice was included for comparison. Mice were placed on a Western diet and followed for 20 weeks to assess plasma lipids, PCSK9 protein levels, atherosclerosis, and editing efficiency. Disruption of Ldlr with AAV-CRISPR was robust, resulting in severe hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerotic lesions in the aorta. AAV-hPCSK9 also produced hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis as expected. Notable sexual dimorphism was observed, wherein AAV-CRISPR was superior for Ldlr removal in male mice, while AAV-hPCSK9 was more effective in female mice. Conclusions- This all-in-one AAV-CRISPR vector targeting Ldlr is an effective and versatile tool to model atherosclerosis with a single injection and provides a useful alternative to the use of germline Ldlr-KO mice.

30024886	Cell autonomous cancer dependencies are now routinely identified using CRISPR loss-of-function viability screens. However, a bias exists that makes it difficult to assess the true essentiality of genes located in amplicons, since the entire amplified region can exhibit lethal scores. These false-positive hits can either be discarded from further analysis, which in cancer models can represent a significant number of hits, or methods can be developed to rescue the true-positives within amplified regions. We propose two methods to rescue true positive hits in amplified regions by correcting for this copy number artefact. The Local Drop Out (LDO) method uses the relative lethality scores within genomic regions to assess true essentiality and does not require additional orthogonal data (e.g. copy number value). LDO is meant to be used in screens covering a dense region of the genome (e.g. a whole chromosome or the whole genome). The General Additive Model (GAM) method models the screening data as a function of the known copy number values and removes the systematic effect from the measured lethality. GAM does not require the same density as LDO, but does require prior knowledge of the copy number values. Both methods have been developed with single sample experiments in mind so that the correction can be applied even in smaller screens. Here we demonstrate the efficacy of both methods at removing the copy number effect and rescuing hits from some of the amplified regions. We estimate a 70-80% decrease of false positive hits with either method in regions of high copy number compared to no correction.

30024364	Lactobacillus gasseri is a human commensal which carries CRISPR-Cas, an adaptive immune system that protects the cell from invasive mobile genetic elements (MGEs). However, MGEs occasionally escape CRISPR targeting due to DNA mutations that occur in sequences involved in CRISPR interference. To better understand CRISPR escape processes, a plasmid interference assay was used to screen for mutants that escape CRISPR-Cas targeting. Plasmids containing a target sequence and a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) were transformed for targeting by the native CRISPR-Cas system. Although the primary outcome of the assay was efficient interference, a small proportion of the transformed population overcame targeting. Mutants containing plasmids that had escaped were recovered to investigate the genetic routes of escape and their relative frequencies. Deletion of the targeting spacer in the native CRISPR array was the dominant pattern of escape, accounting for 52-70 % of the mutants from two L. gasseri strains. We repeatedly observed internal deletions in the chromosomal CRISPR array, characterized by polarized excisions from the leader end that spanned 1-15 spacers, and systematically included the leader-proximal targeting spacer. This study shows that deletions of spacers within CRISPR arrays constitute a key escape mechanism to evade CRISPR targeting, while preserving the functionality of the CRISPR-Cas system. This mechanism enables cells to maintain an active immune system, but allows the uptake of potentially beneficial plasmids. Our study revealed the co-occurrence of other genomic mutations associated with various phenotypes, showing how this selection process uncovers population diversification.

30021068	Efficient clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) guide RNA (gRNA) expression from RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) promoters will aid in construction of complex CRISPR-based synthetic gene networks. Yet, we require tools to properly visualize gRNA directly to quantitatively study the corresponding network behavior. To address this need, we employed a fluorescent gRNA (fgRNA) to visualize synthetic CRISPR network dynamics without affecting gRNA functionality. We show that studying gRNA dynamics directly enables circuit modification and improvement of network function in Pol II-driven CRISPR circuits. This approach generates information necessary for optimizing the overall function of these networks and provides insight into the hurdles remaining in Pol II-regulated gRNA expression.

30016482	In this study, Salmonella prevalence and antimicrobial resistance were evaluated at various production stages in 2 geographically separated breeder farms (referred to as G and F). Day-old chicks for the breeder flock at farm F were purchased from farm G. A total of 219 Salmonella isolates, all identified as Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Enteritidis, were recovered from 1,430 samples (sick chicken carcasses and/or dead embryos). The isolation rates at breeder farms G and F were 10.53% (56/532) and 18.15% (163/898), respectively. Resistance to 4-6 antimicrobial agents was the most frequent phenotype during the laying stage at both farms, suggesting that chicks are exposed to higher risk of antimicrobial-resistant Salmonella infection during this stage of the breeding process. Using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) typing, 5 CRISPR patterns were identified, out of which one pattern was shared by the 2 farms. In addition, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) typing result indicated that 2 clusters (PF-1 and PF-2) were shared among the 2 breeder farms, suggesting that strains were transmitted from breeder farm G to farm F via the trade of day-old chicks. Our findings suggested that the trade of day-old breeder chicks could be one of the potential Salmonella transmission routes, and antibiotics should be administered with caution during the laying stage.

The Csm4 protein expression in MS_Csm4 was detected by Western blot after electroporation of the recombinant plasmid into MS. The growth kinetics of MS_Csm4 in vitro and the influence of reactive N,O species on the growth of MS_Csm4were observed. The intracellular survival of MS_Csm4 and expressions of inducible nitric oxide synthase gene (iNOS) and nitric oxide production (NO) were detected after infection with THP-1 macrophages.	Csm4 protein was successfully expressed in MS_Csm4,which did not affect the growth of the recombinant MS. Reactive N,O species decreased MS_Csm4 colony forming unit (CFU) in vitro. THP-1 increased the expression of iNOS and NO production and decreased intracellular survival of MS_Csm4.	Recombinant MS_Csm4 is susceptible to reactive N,O species in vitro. THP-1 promotes NO release and thus discourages intracellular survival of MS.	XQ Zhai|L Bao|T Luo|X Peng|CF Sun|GP Yang
30014599	Although infrequently associated with illness in humans, Salmonella enterica, subsp. enterica serovar Kentucky is the most common non-clinical, non-human serovar reported in the United States, being largely found in poultry and poultry products, as well as being associated with cattle. This serovar is polyphyletic and can be separated into two groups, Group I and II, based on CRISPR-typing analysis. In Salmonella Kentucky isolates from human clinical samples in Pennsylvania, both lineages are equally represented. The goal of this study was to determine whether both groups were also represented in domestic food animals in Pennsylvania. We analysed the CRISPR arrays from 67 Salmonella Kentucky isolates used PCR and sequencing of CRISPR arrays or analysis of whole genome sequences to analyse the CRISPR arrays and Across a collection of 67 Salmonella Kentucky isolates that includes those collected from farms, veterinary clinical samples as well as isolates from retail meats, we show that Group I Salmonella Kentucky are the exclusive lineage present. We reveal that the specific subtype of over a quarter of these animal isolates are also found to be responsible for causing human salmonellosis in the same region over the same time period.

30009175	Sensorineural hearing loss is caused by the loss of sensory hair cells (HCs) or a damaged afferent nerve pathway to the auditory cortex. The most common option for the treatment of sensorineural hearing loss is hearing rehabilitation using hearing devices. Various kinds of hearing devices are available but, despite recent advancements, their perceived sound quality does not mimic that of the "naïve" cochlea. Damage to crucial cochlear structures is mostly irreversible and results in permanent hearing loss. Cochlear HC regeneration has long been an important goal in the field of hearing research. However, it remains challenging because, thus far, no medical treatment has successfully regenerated cochlear HCs. Recent advances in genetic modulation and developmental techniques have led to novel approaches to generating HCs or protecting against HC loss, to preserve hearing. In this review, we present and review the current status of two different approaches to restoring or protecting hearing, gene therapy, including the newly introduced CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, and stem cell therapy, and suggest the future direction.

30006994	The study of bacteriophages (phages) and prophages has provided key insights into almost every cellular process as well as led to the discovery of unexpected new mechanisms and the development of valuable tools. This is exemplified for RNA-based regulation. For instance, the characterization and exploitation of the antiphage CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat) systems is revolutionizing molecular biology. Phage-encoded proteins such as the RNA-binding MS2 protein, which is broadly used to isolate tagged RNAs, also have been developed as valuable tools. Hfq, the RNA chaperone protein central to the function of many base-pairing small RNAs (sRNAs), was first characterized as a bacterial host factor required for Qβ phage replication. The ongoing studies of RNAs are continuing to reveal regulatory connections between infecting phages, prophages, and bacteria and to provide novel insights. There are bacterial and prophage sRNAs that regulate prophage genes, which impact bacterial virulence as well as bacterial cell killing. Conversely, phage- and prophage-encoded sRNAs modulate the expression of bacterial genes modifying metabolism. An interesting subcategory of the prophage-encoded sRNAs are sponge RNAs that inhibit the activities of bacterial-encoded sRNAs. Phages also affect posttranscriptional regulation in bacteria through proteins that inhibit or alter the activities of key bacterial proteins involved in posttranscriptional regulation. However, what is most exciting about phage and prophage research, given the millions of phage-encoded genes that have not yet been characterized, is the vast potential for discovering new RNA regulators and novel mechanisms and for gaining insight into the evolution of regulatory RNAs.

This limitation must be overcome for some anticipated therapies.	D Carroll
30004018	The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein (Cas) system is a prokaryotic immune system that used to resist foreign genetic factors. It rapidly becomes the hot technology in life sciences and is applies for genome editing to solve the problem of genome-derived diseases. Using CRISPR/Cas technique, the biological DNA sequence can be repaired, cut, replaced, or added. It can effectively change the human stem cells and is expected to achieve results in the treatment. Compared with ZFN and TALEN genome editing techniques, CRISPR is more effective, accurate, and convenient. The application of CRISPR technique in three dimensional (3D) genome structure makes us understand the relationship between linear DNA sequence and 3D chromatin structure. Utilizing CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to reverse or delete CTCF binding sites, to recognize changes of topological isomerism of the genome and interactions between chromatin loops. The purpose of this review is to introduce the characteristics and classification of the current CRISPR/Cas system, multiple functions, and potential therapeutic uses, as well as to outline the effect of the technique on chromatin loops by changing CTCF sites in 3D genomes. We will also briefly describe the importance of ethical dilemmas to be faced in CRISPR applications and provide a perspective for potential CRISPR considerations.	W Wang|L Zhang|X Wang|Y Zeng
30003867	Bacterial regulatory RNAs are key players in adaptation to changing environmental conditions and response to diverse cellular stresses. However, while regulatory RNAs of bacterial pathogens have been intensely studied under defined conditions in vitro, characterization of their role during the infection of eukaryotic host organisms is lagging behind. This review summarizes our current understanding of the contribution of the different classes of regulatory RNAs and RNA-binding proteins to bacterial virulence and illustrates their role in infection by reviewing the mechanisms of some prominent representatives of each class. Emerging technologies are described that bear great potential for global, unbiased studies of virulence-related RNAs in bacterial model and nonmodel pathogens in the future. The review concludes by deducing common principles of RNA-mediated gene expression control of virulence programs in different pathogens, and by defining important open questions for upcoming research in the field.

29997250	Tumor cells engineered to express therapeutic agents have shown promise to treat cancer. However, their potential to target cell surface receptors specific to the tumor site and their posttreatment fate have not been explored. We created therapeutic tumor cells expressing ligands specific to primary and recurrent tumor sites (receptor self-targeted tumor cells) and extensively characterized two different approaches using (i) therapy-resistant cancer cells, engineered with secretable death receptor-targeting ligands for "off-the-shelf" therapy in primary tumor settings, and (ii) therapy-sensitive cancer cells, which were CRISPR-engineered to knock out therapy-specific cell surface receptors before engineering with receptor self-targeted ligands and reapplied in autologous models of recurrent or metastatic disease. We show that both approaches allow high expression of targeted ligands that induce tumor cell killing and translate into marked survival benefits in mouse models of multiple cancer types. Safe elimination of therapeutic cancer cells after treatment was achieved by co-engineering with a prodrug-converting suicide system, which also allowed for real-time in vivo positron emission tomography imaging of therapeutic tumor cell fate. This study demonstrates self-tumor tropism of engineered cancer cells and their therapeutic potential when engineered with receptor self-targeted molecules, and it establishes a roadmap toward a safe clinical translation for different cancer types in primary, recurrent, and metastatic settings.

29996108	The genetic basis of naive pluripotency maintenance and loss is a central question in embryonic stem cell biology. Here, we deploy CRISPR-knockout-based screens in mouse embryonic stem cells to interrogate this question through a genome-wide, non-biased approach using the Rex1GFP reporter as a phenotypic readout. This highly sensitive and efficient method identified genes in diverse biological processes and pathways. We uncovered a key role for negative regulators of mTORC1 in maintenance and exit from naive pluripotency and provided an integrated account of how mTORC1 activity influences naive pluripotency through Gsk3. Our study therefore reinforces Gsk3 as the central node and provides a comprehensive, data-rich resource that will improve our understanding of mechanisms regulating pluripotency and stimulate avenues for further mechanistic studies.

29989077	Custom-designed nucleases, including CRISPR-Cas9 and CRISPR-Cpf1, are widely used to realize the precise genome editing. The high-coverage, low-cost and quantifiability make high-throughput sequencing (NGS) to be an effective method to assess the efficiency of custom-designed nucleases. However, contrast to standardized transcriptome protocol, the NGS data lacks a user-friendly pipeline connecting different tools that can automatically calculate mutation, evaluate editing efficiency and realize in a more comprehensive dataset that can be visualized. Here, we have developed an automatic stand-alone toolkit based on python script, namely CRISPRMatch, to process the high-throughput genome-editing data of CRISPR nuclease transformed protoplasts by integrating analysis steps like mapping reads and normalizing reads count, calculating mutation frequency (deletion and insertion), evaluating efficiency and accuracy of genome-editing, and visualizing the results (tables and figures).

29982016	In this study, we investigated the effects of the association of a single plasmid or its co-complexation along with an oligonucleotide on the physicochemical properties of cationic nanoemulsions and liposomes intended for gene editing. Formulations composed of DOPE, DOTAP, DSPE-PEG (liposomes), MCT (nanoemulsions), and water were obtained by microfluidization. DSPE-PEG was found to play a crucial role on the size and polydispersity index of nanocarriers. Nucleic acids were complexated by adsorption at different charge ratios. No significant differences were noticed in the physicochemical properties of nanocarriers (i.e. droplet size, polydispersity index, or zeta potential) when a single plasmid or both plasmid and oligonucleotide were adsorbed to the formulations. Transmission electron microscopy photomicrographs suggested round nanostructures with the nucleic acids and DSPE-PEG enfolding the surface. Complexes at +4/-1 charge ratio protected nucleic acids against DNase I degradation. The oligonucleotide seemed to be released from the liposomal complexes, while nanoemulsions only released the plasmid after 24 and 48 h of incubation in DMEM supplemented or not. In vitro experiments demonstrated that complexes were highly tolerable to human fibroblasts, Hep-G2, and HEK-293 cells, demonstrating also an uptake ability of about 30%, 30%, and 90%, respectively, no matter what the formulation or the combination of nucleic acids used. Transfection efficiency of the formulations was around 25% in human fibroblasts, 32% in HEK-293, and 15% in Hep-G2 cells. The overall results demonstrated the behavior of liposomes and nanoemulsions complexed with a plasmid or a mixture of a plasmid and an oligonucleotide, and demonstrated that the association with one or two nucleic acids sequences of different length does not seem to interfere in the physicochemical characteristics of complexes or in the uptake capacity by three different types of cells.

29981237	Bacillus subtilis has been commonly applied to industrial enzyme production due to its genetic tractability, "generally recognized as safe (GRAS)" status, and robust growth characteristics. In spite of its ideal attributes as a biomanufacturing platform, B. subtilis has seen limited use in the production of other value-added biochemicals. Here, we report the derivation of engineered strains of B. subtilis for l-valine overproduction using our recently developed CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats)-Cas9 (CRISPR-associated [protein] 9) toolkit. We first manipulate the native l-valine biosynthetic pathway by relieving transcriptional and allosteric regulation, resulting in a >14-fold increase in the l-valine titer, compared to the wild-type strain. We subsequently identify and eliminate factors limiting l-valine overproduction, specifically increasing pyruvate availability and blocking the competing l-leucine and l-isoleucine biosynthetic pathways. By inactivating (a) pdhA, encoding the E1α subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, to increase the intracellular pyruvate pool, and (b) leuA and ilvA, respectively encoding 2-isopropylmalate synthase and l-threonine dehydratase, to abolish the competing pathways, the l-valine titer reached 4.61 g/L in shake flask cultures. Our engineered l-valine-overproducing strains of B. subtilis are devoid of plasmids and do not sporulate due to the inactivation of sigF, encoding the sporulation-specific transcription factor σ F , making them attractive for large-scale l-valine production. However, acetate dissimilation was identified as limiting l-valine overproduction in ΔpdhA B. subtilis strains, and improving acetate dissimilation or identifying alternate modes of increasing pyruvate pools to enhance l-valine-overproduction should be explored.

29980686	RNA-based drugs depend on chemical modifications to increase potency and to decrease immunogenicity in vivo. Chemical modification will likely improve the guide RNAs involved in CRISPR-Cas9-based therapeutics as well. Cas9 orthologs are RNA-guided microbial effectors that cleave DNA. Here, we explore chemical modifications at all positions of the crRNA guide and tracrRNA cofactor. We identify several heavily modified versions of crRNA and tracrRNA that are more potent than their unmodified counterparts. In addition, we describe fully chemically modified crRNAs and tracrRNAs (containing no 2'-OH groups) that are functional in human cells. These designs will contribute to Cas9-based therapeutics since heavily modified RNAs tend to be more stable in vivo (thus increasing potency). We anticipate that our designs will improve the use of Cas9 via RNP and mRNA delivery for in vivo and ex vivo purposes.

29980666	CRISPR-Cas9-based gene activation (CRISPRa) is an attractive tool for cellular reprogramming applications due to its high multiplexing capacity and direct targeting of endogenous loci. Here we present the reprogramming of primary human skin fibroblasts into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) using CRISPRa, targeting endogenous OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, MYC, and LIN28A promoters. The low basal reprogramming efficiency can be improved by an order of magnitude by additionally targeting a conserved Alu-motif enriched near genes involved in embryo genome activation (EEA-motif). This effect is mediated in part by more efficient activation of NANOG and REX1. These data demonstrate that human somatic cells can be reprogrammed into iPSCs using only CRISPRa. Furthermore, the results unravel the involvement of EEA-motif-associated mechanisms in cellular reprogramming.

29980561	Streptomyces has a strong capability for producing a large number of bioactive natural products and remains invaluable as a source for the discovery of novel drug leads. Although the Streptococcus pyogenes CRISPR-Cas9-assisted genome editing tool has been developed for rapid genetic engineering in Streptomyces, it has a number of limitations, including the toxicity of SpCas9 expression in some important industrial Streptomyces strains and the need for complex expression constructs when targeting multiple genomic loci. To address these problems, in this study, we developed a high-efficiency CRISPR-Cpf1 system (from Francisella novicida) for multiplex genome editing and transcriptional repression in Streptomyces Using an all-in-one editing plasmid with homology-directed repair (HDR), our CRISPR-Cpf1 system precisely deletes single or double genes at efficiencies of 75 to 95% in Streptomyces coelicolor When no templates for HDR are present, random-sized DNA deletions are achieved by FnCpf1-induced double-strand break (DSB) repair by a reconstituted nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway. Furthermore, a DNase-deactivated Cpf1 (ddCpf1)-based integrative CRISPRi system is developed for robust, multiplex gene repression using a single customized crRNA array. Finally, we demonstrate that FnCpf1 and SpCas9 exhibit different suitability in tested industrial Streptomyces species and show that FnCpf1 can efficiently promote HDR-mediated gene deletion in the 5-oxomilbemycin-producing strain Streptomyces hygroscopicus SIPI-KF, in which SpCas9 does not work well. Collectively, FnCpf1 is a powerful and indispensable addition to the Streptomyces CRISPR toolbox.IMPORTANCE Rapid, efficient genetic engineering of Streptomyces strains is critical for genome mining of novel natural products (NPs) as well as strain improvement. Here, a novel and high-efficiency Streptomyces genome editing tool is established based on the FnCRISPR-Cpf1 system, which is an attractive and powerful alternative to the S. pyogenes CRISPR-Cas9 system due to its unique features. When combined with HDR or NHEJ, FnCpf1 enables the creation of gene(s) deletion with high efficiency. Furthermore, a ddCpf1-based integrative CRISPRi platform is established for simple, multiplex transcriptional repression. Of importance, FnCpf1-based genome editing proves to be a highly efficient tool for genetic modification of some important industrial Streptomyces strains (e.g., S. hygroscopicus SIPI-KF) that cannot utilize the SpCRISPR-Cas9 system. We expect the CRISPR-Cpf1-assisted genome editing tool to accelerate discovery and development of pharmaceutically active NPs in Streptomyces as well as other actinomycetes.

29976198	Genome-wide knockout studies, noncoding deletion scans, and other large-scale studies require a simple and lightweight framework that can quickly discover and score thousands of candidate CRISPR guides targeting an arbitrary DNA sequence. While several CRISPR web applications exist, there is a need for a high-throughput tool to rapidly discover and process hundreds of thousands of CRISPR targets.	Here, we introduce FlashFry, a fast and flexible command-line tool for characterizing large numbers of CRISPR target sequences. With FlashFry, users can specify an unconstrained number of mismatches to putative off-targets, richly annotate discovered sites, and tag potential guides with commonly used on-target and off-target scoring metrics. FlashFry runs at speeds comparable to commonly used genome-wide sequence aligners, and output is provided as an easy-to-manipulate text file.	FlashFry is a fast and convenient command-line tool to discover and score CRISPR targets within large DNA sequences.	A McKenna|J Shendure
29975607	Genome editing by sequence-specific nucleases (SSNs) has revolutionized biology by enabling targeted modifications of genomes. Although routine plant genome editing emerged only a few years ago, we are already witnessing the first applications to improve disease resistance. In particular, CRISPR-Cas9 has democratized the use of genome editing in plants thanks to the ease and robustness of this method. Here, we review the recent developments in plant genome editing and its application to enhancing disease resistance against plant pathogens. In the future, bioedited disease resistant crops will become a standard tool in plant breeding.	T Langner|S Kamoun|K Belhaj
29974860	Zebrafish is a powerful model for forward genetics. Reverse genetic approaches are limited by the time required to generate stable mutant lines. We describe a system for gene knockout that consistently produces null phenotypes in G0 zebrafish. Yolk injection of sets of four CRISPR/Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes redundantly targeting a single gene recapitulated germline-transmitted knockout phenotypes in >90% of G0 embryos for each of 8 test genes. Early embryonic (6 hpf) and stable adult phenotypes were produced. Simultaneous multi-gene knockout was feasible but associated with toxicity in some cases. To facilitate use, we generated a lookup table of four-guide sets for 21,386 zebrafish genes and validated several. Using this resource, we targeted 50 cardiomyocyte transcriptional regulators and uncovered a role of zbtb16a in cardiac development. This system provides a platform for rapid screening of genes of interest in development, physiology, and disease models in zebrafish.	RS Wu|II Lam|H Clay|DN Duong|RC Deo|SR Coughlin
29973285	Targeting specificity has been a barrier to applying genome editing systems in functional genomics, precise medicine and plant breeding. In plants, only limited studies have used whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to test off-target effects of Cas9. The cause of numerous discovered mutations is still controversial. Furthermore, WGS-based off-target analysis of Cpf1 (Cas12a) has not been reported in any higher organism to date.	We conduct a WGS analysis of 34 plants edited by Cas9 and 15 plants edited by Cpf1 in T0 and T1 generations along with 20 diverse control plants in rice. The sequencing depths range from 45× to 105× with read mapping rates above 96%. Our results clearly show that most mutations in edited plants are created by the tissue culture process, which causes approximately 102 to 148 single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and approximately 32 to 83 insertions/deletions (indels) per plant. Among 12 Cas9 single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) and three Cpf1 CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) assessed by WGS, only one Cas9 sgRNA resulted in off-target mutations in T0 lines at sites predicted by computer programs. Moreover, we cannot find evidence for bona fide off-target mutations due to continued expression of Cas9 or Cpf1 with guide RNAs in T1 generation.	Our comprehensive and rigorous analysis of WGS data across multiple sample types suggests both Cas9 and Cpf1 nucleases are very specific in generating targeted DNA modifications and off-targeting can be avoided by designing guide RNAs with high specificity.

29968790	Multiple applications of genome editing by CRISPR-Cas9 necessitate stringent regulation and Cas9 variants have accordingly been generated whose activity responds to small ligands, temperature or light. However, these approaches are often impracticable, for example in clinical therapeutic genome editing in situ or gene drives in which environmentally-compatible control is paramount. With this in mind, we have developed heritable Cas9-mediated mammalian genome editing that is acutely controlled by the cheap lysine derivative, Lys(Boc) (BOC). Genetic code expansion permitted non-physiological BOC incorporation such that Cas9 (Cas9BOC) was expressed in a full-length, active form in cultured somatic cells only after BOC exposure. Stringently BOC-dependent, heritable editing of transgenic and native genomic loci occurred when Cas9BOC was expressed at the onset of mouse embryonic development from cRNA or Cas9BOC transgenic females. The tightly controlled Cas9 editing system reported here promises to have broad applications and is a first step towards purposed, spatiotemporal gene drive regulation over large geographical ranges.

29968520	In recent years there has been great progress with the implementation and utilization of Clustered Regularly Interspaced Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated protein (Cas) systems in the world of genetic engineering. Many forms of CRISPR-Cas9 have been developed as genome editing tools and techniques and, most recently, several non-genome editing CRISPR-Cas systems have emerged. Most of the CRISPR-Cas systems have been classified as either Class I or Class II and are further divided among several subtypes within each class. Research teams and companies are currently in dispute over patents for these CRISPR-Cas systems as numerous powerful applications are concurrently under development. This mini review summarizes the appearance of CRISPR-Cas systems with a focus on the predominant CRISPR-Cas9 system as well as the classifications and subtypes for CRISPR-Cas. Non-genome editing uses of CRISPR-Cas are also highlighted and a brief overview of the commercialization of CRISPR is provided.	F Perez Rojo|RKM Nyman|AAT Johnson|MP Navarro|MH Ryan|W Erskine|P Kaur
29968495	The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated Cas9 system has been used to excise the HIV-1 proviral genome from latently infected cells, potentially offering a cure for HIV-infected patients. Recent studies have shown that most published HIV-1 guide RNAs (gRNAs) do not account for the diverse viral quasispecies within or among patients, which continue to diversify with time even in long-term antiretroviral therapy (ART)-suppressed patients. Given this observation, proviral genomes were deep sequenced from 23 HIV-1-infected patients in the Drexel Medicine CNS AIDS Research and Eradication Study cohort at two different visits. Based on the spectrum of integrated proviral DNA polymorphisms observed, three gRNA design strategies were explored: based on the patient's own HIV-1 sequences (personalized), based on consensus sequences from a large sample of patients [broad-spectrum (BS)], or a combination of both approaches. Using a bioinformatic algorithm, the personalized gRNA design was predicted to cut 46 of 48 patient samples at 90% efficiency, whereas the top 4 BS gRNAs (BS4) were predicted to excise provirus from 44 of 48 patient samples with 90% efficiency. Using a mixed design with the top three BS gRNAs plus one personalized gRNA (BS3 + PS1) resulted in predicted excision of provirus from 45 of 48 patient samples with 90% efficiency. In summary, these studies used an algorithmic design strategy to identify potential BS gRNAs to target a spectrum of HIV-1 long teriminal repeat (LTR) quasispecies for use with a small HIV-1-infected population. This approach should advance CRISPR/Cas9 excision technology taking into account the extensive molecular heterogeneity of HIV-1 that persists in situ after prolonged ART.

29968018	This paper presents an overview of the key ethical questions of performing gene editing research on military service members. The recent technological advance in gene editing capabilities provided by CRISPR/Cas9 and their path towards first-in-human trials has reinvigorated the debate on human enhancement for non-medical purposes. Human performance optimization has long been a priority of military research in order to close the gap between the advancement of warfare and the limitations of human actors. In spite of this focus on temporary performance improvement, biomedical enhancement is an extension of these endeavours and the ethical issues of such research should be considered. In this paper, we explore possible applications of CRISPR to military human gene editing research and how it could be specifically applied towards protection of service members against biological or chemical weapons. We analyse three normative areas including risk-benefit analysis, informed consent, and inequality of access as it relates to CRISPR applications for military research to help inform and provide considerations for military institutional review boards and policymakers.

29967440	Prophages are known to encode important virulence factors in the human pathogen Vibrio cholerae. However, little is known about the occurrence and composition of prophage-encoded traits in environmental vibrios. A database of 5,674 prophage-like elements constructed from 1,874 Vibrio genome sequences, covering sixty-four species, revealed that prophage-like elements encoding possible properties such as virulence and antibiotic resistance are widely distributed among environmental vibrios, including strains classified as non-pathogenic. Moreover, we found that 45% of Vibrio species harbored a complete prophage-like element belonging to the Inoviridae family, which encode the zonula occludens toxin (Zot) previously described in the V. cholerae. Interestingly, these zot-encoding prophages were found in a variety of Vibrio strains covering both clinical and marine isolates, including strains from deep sea hydrothermal vents and deep subseafloor sediments. In addition, the observation that a spacer from the CRISPR locus in the marine fish pathogen V. anguillarum strain PF7 had 95% sequence identity with a zot gene from the Inoviridae prophage found in V. anguillarum strain PF4, suggests acquired resistance to inoviruses in this species. Altogether, our results contribute to the understanding of the role of prophages as drivers of evolution and virulence in the marine Vibrio bacteria.

29964176	The impact of the CRISPR-Cas biotechnological systems has recently broadened the genome editing toolbox available to different model organisms further with the addition of new efficient RNA-guided endonucleases. We have recently optimized CRISPR-Cpf1 (renamed Cas12a) system in zebrafish. We showed that (i) in the absence of Cpf1 protein, crRNAs are unstable and degraded in vivo, and CRISPR-Cpf1 RNP complexes efficiently mutagenize the zebrafish genome; and (ii) temperature modulates Cpf1 activity especially affecting AsCpf1, which experiences a reduced performance below 37 °C. Here, we describe a step-by-step protocol on how to easily design and generate crRNAs in vitro, purify recombinant Cpf1 proteins, and assemble ribonucleoprotein complexes to carry out efficient mutagenesis in zebrafish in a constitutive and temperature-controlled manner. Finally, we explain how to induce Cpf1-mediated homology-directed repair using single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides. In summary, this protocol includes the steps to efficiently modify the zebrafish genome and other ectothermic organisms using the CRISPR-Cpf1 system.

29963983	The CRISPR system for prokaryotic adaptive immunity provides RNA-mediated protection from viruses and mobile genetic elements. When viral RNA transcripts are detected, type III systems adopt an activated state that licenses DNA interference and synthesis of cyclic oligoadenylate (cOA). cOA activates nucleases and transcription factors that orchestrate the antiviral response. We demonstrate that cOA synthesis is subject to tight temporal control, commencing on target RNA binding, and is deactivated rapidly as target RNA is cleaved and dissociates. Mismatches in the target RNA are well tolerated and still activate the cyclase domain, except when located close to the 3' end of the target. Phosphorothioate modification reduces target RNA cleavage and stimulates cOA production. The 'RNA shredding' activity originally ascribed to type III systems may thus be a reflection of an exquisite mechanism for control of the Cas10 subunit, rather than a direct antiviral defence.

29961565	Disrupted in schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) has been implicated in a number of psychiatric diseases along with neurodevelopmental phenotypes such as the proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitor cells. While there has been significant effort directed toward understanding the function of DISC1 through the determination of its protein-protein interactions within an in vitro setting, endogenous interactions involving DISC1 within a cell type-specific setting relevant to neural development remain unclear.	Using CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9) genome engineering technology, we inserted an endogenous 3X-FLAG tag at the C-terminus of the canonical DISC1 gene in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We further differentiated these cells and used affinity purification to determine protein-protein interactions involving DISC1 in iPSC-derived neural progenitor cells and astrocytes.	We were able to determine 151 novel cell type-specific proteins present in DISC1 endogenous interactomes. The DISC1 interactomes can be clustered into several subcomplexes that suggest novel DISC1 cell-specific functions. In addition, the DISC1 interactome in iPSC-derived neural progenitor cells associates in a connected network containing proteins found to harbor de novo mutations in patients affected by schizophrenia and contains a subset of novel interactions that are known to harbor syndromic mutations in neurodevelopmental disorders.	Endogenous DISC1 interactomes within iPSC-derived human neural progenitor cells and astrocytes are able to provide context to DISC1 function in a cell type-specific setting relevant to neural development and enables the integration of psychiatric disease risk factors within a set of defined molecular functions.

29961307	The establishment of protocols to differentiate kidney organoids from human pluripotent stem cells provides potential applications of kidney organoids in regenerative medicine. Modeling of renal diseases, drug screening, nephrotoxicity testing of compounds, and regenerative therapy are attractive applications. Although much progress still remains to be made in the development of kidney organoids, recent advances in clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated system 9 (Cas9) genome editing and three-dimensional bioprinting technologies have contributed to the application of kidney organoids in clinical fields. In this section, we review recent advances in the applications of kidney organoids to kidney disease modelling, drug screening, nephrotoxicity testing, and regenerative therapy.	YK Kim|SA Nam|CW Yang
29959923	RNA-guided CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat)-associated Cas proteins have recently emerged as versatile tools to investigate and engineer the genome. The programmability of CRISPR-Cas has proven especially useful for probing genomic function in high-throughput. Facile single-guide RNA library synthesis allows CRISPR-Cas screening to rapidly investigate the functional consequences of genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic perturbations. Furthermore, by combining CRISPR-Cas perturbations with downstream single-cell analyses (flow cytometry, expression profiling, etc.), forward screens can generate robust data sets linking genotypes to complex cellular phenotypes. In the following review, we highlight recent advances in CRISPR-Cas genomic screening while outlining protocols and pitfalls associated with screen implementation. Finally, we describe current challenges limiting the utility of CRISPR-Cas screening as well as future research needed to resolve these impediments. As CRISPR-Cas technologies develop, so too will their clinical applications. Looking ahead, patient centric functional screening in primary cells will likely play a greater role in disease management and therapeutic development.	K Ford|D McDonald|P Mali
29958882	Programmable control of gene expression is essential to understanding gene function, engineering cellular behaviors, and developing therapeutics. Beyond the gene editing applications enabled by the nuclease CRISPR-Cas9 and CRISPR-Cas12a, the invention of the nuclease-dead Cas molecules (dCas9 and dCas12a) offers a platform for the precise control of genome function without gene editing. Diverse dCas tools have been developed, which constitute a comprehensive toolbox that allows for interrogation of gene function and modulation of the cellular behaviors. This review summarizes current applications of the dCas tools for transcription regulation, epigenetic engineering, genome imaging, genetic screens, and chromatin immunoprecipitation. We also highlight the advantages and existing challenges of the current dCas tools in genetic engineering and synthetic biology, and provide perspectives on future directions and applications.

29951376	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins provide acquired genetic immunity against the entry of mobile genetic elements (MGEs). The immune defense provided by various subtypes of the CRISPR-Cas system has been confirmed and is closely associated with the formation of immunological memory in CRISPR arrays, called CRISPR adaptation or spacer acquisition. However, whether type II-C CRISPR-Cas systems are also involved in spacer acquisition remains largely unknown. This study explores and provides some definitive evidence regarding spacer acquisition of the type II-C CRISPR-Cas system from Riemerella anatipestifer (RA) CH-2 (RA-CH-2). Firstly, introducing an exogenous plasmid into RA-CH-2 triggered spacer acquisition of RA CRISPR-Cas system, and the acquisition of new spacers led to plasmid instability in RA-CH-2. Furthermore, deletion of cas1 or cas2 of RA-CH-2 abrogated spacer acquisition and subsequently stabilized the exogenous plasmid, suggesting that both Cas1 and Cas2 are required for spacer acquisition of RA-CH-2 CRISPR-Cas system, consistent with the reported role of Cas1 and Cas2 in type I-E and II-A systems. Finally, assays for studying Cas1 nuclease activity and the interaction of Cas1 with Cas2 contributed to a better understanding of the adaptation mechanism of RA CRISPR-Cas system. This is the first experimental identification of the naïve adaptation of type II-C CRISPR-Cas system.

29950320	Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is a multi-copy genome whose cell copy number varies depending on tissue type. Mutations in mtDNA can cause a wide spectrum of diseases. Mutated mtDNA is often found as a subset of the total mtDNA population in a cell or tissue, a situation known as heteroplasmy. As mitochondrial dysfunction only presents after a certain level of heteroplasmy has been acquired, ways to artificially reduce or replace the mutated species have been attempted. This review addresses recent approaches and advances in this field, focusing on the prevention of pathogenic mtDNA transfer via mitochondrial donation techniques such as maternal spindle transfer and pronuclear transfer in which mutated mtDNA in the oocyte or fertilized embryo is substituted with normal copies of the mitochondrial genome. This review also discusses the molecular targeting and cleavage of pathogenic mtDNA to shift heteroplasmy using antigenomic therapy and genome engineering techniques including Zinc-finger nucleases and transcription activator-like effector nucleases. Finally, it considers CRISPR technology and the unique difficulties that mitochondrial genome editing presents.	PK Rai|L Craven|K Hoogewijs|OM Russell|RN Lightowlers
29946044	The necrotrophic fungal plant pathogen Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is responsible for substantial global crop losses annually resulting in localized food insecurity and loss of livelihood. Understanding the basis of this broad-host-range and aggressive pathogenicity is hampered by the quantitative nature of both host resistance and pathogen virulence. To improve this understanding, methods for efficient functional gene characterization that build upon the existing complete S. sclerotiorum genome sequence are needed. Here, we report on the development of a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR-Cas9)-mediated strategy for creating gene disruption mutants and the application of this technique for exploring roles of known and hypothesized virulence factors. A key finding of this research is that transformation with a circular plasmid encoding Cas9, target single guide RNA (sgRNA), and a selectable marker resulted in a high frequency of targeted, insertional gene mutation. We observed that 100% of the mutants integrated large rearranged segments of the transforming plasmid at the target site facilitated by the nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) repair pathway. This result was confirmed in multiple target sites within the same gene in three independent wild-type isolates of S. sclerotiorum and in a second independent gene. Targeting the previously characterized Ssoah1 gene allowed us to confirm the loss-of-function nature of the CRISPR-Cas9-mediated mutants and explore new aspects of the mutant phenotype. Applying this technology to create mutations in a second previously uncharacterized gene allowed us to determine the requirement for melanin accumulation in infection structure development and function.IMPORTANCE Fungi that cause plant diseases by rotting or blighting host tissue with limited specificity remain among the most difficult to control. This is largely due to the quantitative nature of host resistance and a limited understanding of fungal pathogenicity. A mechanistic understanding of pathogenicity requires the ability to manipulate candidate virulence genes to test hypotheses regarding their roles in disease development. Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is among the most notorious of these so-called broad-host-range necrotrophic plant pathogens. The work described here provides a new method for rapidly constructing gene disruption vectors to create gene mutations with high efficiency compared with existing methods. Applying this method to characterize gene functions in S. sclerotiorum, we confirm the requirement for oxalic acid production as a virulence factor in multiple isolates of the fungus and demonstrate that melanin accumulation is not required for infection. Using this approach, the pace of functional gene characterization and the understanding of pathogenicity and related disease resistance will increase.	J Li|Y Zhang|Y Zhang|PL Yu|H Pan|JA Rollins
29945667	Previous work aimed at understanding the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) governing caudal hindbrain formation identified morphogens such as Retinoic Acid (RA) and Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), as well as transcription factors like hoxb1b, hoxb1a, hnf1ba, and valentino as being required for rhombomere (r) r4-r6 formation in zebrafish. Considering that the caudal hindbrain is relatively complex - for instance, unique sets of neurons are formed in each rhombomere segment - it is likely that additional essential genes remain to be identified and integrated into the caudal hindbrain GRN.	By taking advantage of gene expression data available in the Zebrafish Information Network (ZFIN), we identified 84 uncharacterized genes that are expressed in r4-r6. We selected a representative set of 22 genes and assayed their expression patterns in hoxb1b, hoxb1a, hnf1b, and valentino mutants with the goal of positioning them in the caudal hindbrain GRN. We also investigated the effects of RA and FGF on the expression of this gene set. To examine whether these genes are necessary for r4-r6 development, we analyzed germline mutants for six of the genes (gas6, gbx1, sall4, eglf6, celf2, and greb1l) for defects in hindbrain development.	Our results reveal that r4 gene expression is unaffected by the individual loss of hoxb1b, hoxb1a or RA, but is under the combinatorial regulation of RA together with hoxb1b. In contrast, r5/r6 gene expression is dependent on RA, FGF, hnf1ba and valentino - as individual loss of these factors abolishes r5/r6 gene expression. Our analysis of six mutant lines did not reveal rhombomere or neuronal defects, but transcriptome analysis of one line (gas6 mutant) identified expression changes for genes involved in several developmental processes - suggesting that these genes may have subtle roles in hindbrain development.	We conclude that r4-r6 formation is relatively robust, such that very few genes are absolutely required for this process. However, there are mechanistic differences in r4 versus r5/r6, such that no single factor is required for r4 development while several genes are individually required for r5/r6 formation.

29943304	Functional genomics aims to develop an in-depth understanding of how specific gene dysfunctions are related to diseases. A common method for investigating the genome and its complex functions is via perturbation of the interactions between the DNA, RNA and their protein respective protein derivatives. Commonly, arrayed and pooled genetic screens are utilized to achieve this and in recent years have been fundamental in achieving the current level of understanding for gene dysfunctions. However, they are limited in specific aspects which scientists have attempted to address. Clustered regularly palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based methods for genetic screens have in recent years become more prevalent but crucially shared similar properties to previous methods and failing to provide a distinct advantage over previous methods. CROP-seq, Perturb-seq, and CRISPR-seq have combined CRISPR and single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and is the newest addition to the geneticist's arsenal, providing scientists with methods to edit DNA with improved speed, accuracy, and efficiency which could usher us into a new era of study methods for functional genomics. We briefly overview the CRISPR-Cas9 systems, the evolution of genetic screening in recent years, and evaluate and discuss the significance of CROP-seq, Perturb-seq, and CRISPR-seq.	J Yao|HL Dai
29941452	CRISPR/Cas9 is now widely used in biomedical research and has great potential for clinical applications. However, the safety and efficacy of this gene-editing technique are significant issues. Recent reports on mouse models and human cells have raised concerns that off-target mutations could hamper applying the CRISPR technology in patients. The high similarities of nonhuman primates to humans in genome content and organization, genetic diversity, physiology, and cognitive abilities have made these animals ideal experimental models for understanding human diseases and developing therapeutics. Off-target mutations of CRISPR/Cas9 have been analyzed in previous studies of nonhuman primates, but no report has investigated genome-wide off-target effects in living monkeys. Here, we used rhesus monkeys in which a genetic disorder mimicking Duchenne muscular dystrophy had previously been produced with CRISPR/Cas9. Using whole-genome sequencing to comprehensively assess on- and off-target mutations in these animals, we found that CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing is active on the expected genomic sites without producing off-target modifications in other functional regions of the genome. These findings suggest that the CRISPR/Cas9 technique could be relatively safe and effective in modeling genetic disease in nonhuman primates and in future therapeutic research of human diseases.

29940185	Prokaryotic adaptive immune systems use Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPRs) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins for RNA-guided cleavage of foreign genetic elements. The focus of this review, Type VI CRISPR-Cas systems, contain a single protein, Cas13 (formerly C2c2) that when assembled with a CRISPR RNA (crRNA) forms a crRNA-guided RNA-targeting effector complex. Type VI CRISPR-Cas systems can be divided into four subtypes (A-D) based on Cas13 phylogeny. All Cas13 proteins studied to date possess two enzymatically distinct ribonuclease activities that are required for optimal interference. One RNase is responsible for pre-crRNA processing to form mature Type VI interference complexes, while the other RNase activity provided by the two Higher Eukaryotes and Prokaryotes Nucleotide-binding (HEPN) domains, is required for degradation of target-RNA during viral interference. In this review, I will compare and contrast what is known about the molecular architecture and behavior of Type VI (A-D) CRISPR-Cas13 interference complexes, how this allows them to carry out their RNA-targeting function, how Type VI accessory proteins are able to modulate Cas13 activity, and how together all of these features have led to the rapid development of a range of RNA-targeting applications. Throughout I will also discuss some of the outstanding questions regarding Cas13's molecular behavior, and its role in bacterial adaptive immunity and RNA-targeting applications.	MR O'Connell
29939993	Plague, caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, is a highly infectious, zoonotic disease. Hundreds of human plague cases are reported across the world annually. Qinghai Plateau is one of the most severely affected plague regions in China, with more than 240 fatal cases of Y. pestis in the last 60 years. Conventional epidemiologic analysis has effectively guided the prevention and control of local plague transmission; however, molecular genetic analysis is more effective for investigating population diversity and transmission. In this report, we employed different genetic markers to analyze the population structure of Y. pestis in Qinghai Plateau.	We employed a two-step hierarchical strategy to analyze the phylogeny of 102 Qinghai Plateau isolates of Y. pestis, collected between 1954 and 2011. First, we defined the genealogy of Y. pestis by constructed minimum spanning tree based on 25 key SNPs. Seven groups were identified, with group 1.IN2 being identified as the dominant population. Second, two methods, MLVA and CRISPR, were applied to examine the phylogenetic detail of group 1.IN2, which was further divided into three subgroups. Subgroups of 1.IN2 revealed a clear geographic cluster, possibly associated with interaction between bacteriophage and Y. pestis. More recently, Y. pestis populations appear to have shifted from the east toward the center and west of Qinghai Plateau. This shift could be related to destruction of the local niche of the original plague focus through human activities. Additionally, we found that the abundance and relative proportion of 1.IN2 subgroups varied by decade and might be responsible for the fluctuations of plague epidemics in Qinghai Plateau.	Molecular genotyping methods provided us with detailed information on population diversity and the spatial-temporal distribution of dominant populations of Y. pestis, which will facilitate future surveillance, prevention, and control of plague in Qinghai Plateau.

29939793	Several real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays have been developed for detection and quantification of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in complex matrices by targeting genes for serogroup-specific O-antigen (rfbEO157), H7 antigen, and one or more major virulence factors (Shiga toxin and intimin). A major limitation of such assays is that coamplification of H7 and virulence genes in a sample does not signal association of those genes with the O157 serogroup. Clusters of regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) polymorphisms are highly correlated with certain enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) serotypes, including O157:H7, and the presence of genes for Shiga toxin (stx1 and stx2) and intimin (eae). Our objectives were to develop and validate a qPCR assay targeting the CRISPR array for the detection and quantification of EHEC O157:H7 in cattle feces and to evaluate the applicability of the assay for detection of and comparison with a four-plex qPCR assay targeting rfbEO157, stx1, stx2, and eae genes and a culture method. Detection limits of the CRISPRO157:H7 qPCR assay for cattle feces spiked with pure cultures were 2.1 × 103 and 2.3 × 100 CFU/g before and after enrichment, respectively. Detection of E. coli O157 in feedlot cattle fecal samples (n = 576) was compared among the CRISPRO157:H7 qPCR assay, culture method, and four-plex qPCR assay. The CRISPRO157:H7 qPCR detected 42.2% of the samples (243 of 576 samples) as positive for E. coli O157:H7, compared with 30.4% (175 samples) by the culture method. Nearly all samples (97.2%; 560 samples) were positive for rfbEO157 by the four-plex PCR, but 21.8% (122 of 560 samples) were negative for the stx and/or eae genes, making it unlikely that EHEC O157:H7 was present in these samples. Cohen's kappa statistic indicated a fair and poor agreement beyond that due to chance between the CRISPR assay and the culture method and four-plex assay, respectively. This novel qPCR assay can detect the EHEC O157:H7 serotype in cattle feces by targeting CRISPR polymorphisms.	LW Noll|R Chall|PB Shridhar|X Liu|J Bai|S Delannoy|P Fach|TG Nagaraja
29937051	In metabolic engineering, the production of industrially relevant chemicals, via rational engineering of microorganisms, is an intensive area of research. One particular group of microorganisms that is fast becoming recognized for their commercial potential is cyanobacteria. Through the process of photosynthesis, cyanobacteria can use CO2 as a building block to synthesize carbon-based chemicals. In recent years, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-dependent approaches have rapidly gained popularity for engineering cyanobacteria. Such approaches permit markerless genome editing, simultaneous manipulation of multiple genes, and transcriptional regulation of genes. The drastically shortened timescale for mutant selection and segregation is especially advantageous for cyanobacterial work. In this review, we highlight studies that have implemented CRISPR-based tools for the metabolic engineering of cyanobacteria.	J Behler|D Vijay|WR Hess|MK Akhtar
29927077	Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) play a pivotal role in spatiotemporal control of tissue-specific gene expression, yet the molecular composition of the vast majority of CREs in native chromatin remains unknown. In this article, we describe the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) affinity purification in situ of regulatory elements (CAPTURE) approach to simultaneously identify locus-specific chromatin-regulating protein complexes and long-range DNA interactions. Using an in vivo biotinylated nuclease-deficient Cas9 (dCas9) protein and programmable single guide RNAs (sgRNAs), this approach allows for high-resolution and locus-specific isolation of protein complexes and long-range chromatin looping associated with single copy CREs in mammalian cells. Unbiased analysis of the compositional structure of developmentally regulated or disease-associated CREs identifies new features of transcriptional regulation. Hence, CAPTURE provides a versatile platform to study genomic locus-regulating chromatin composition in a mammalian genome. © 2018 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

29924937	DSP (desmoplakin), the most abundant component of desmosomes, which maintain the mechanical integrity of epithelium, is a genome-wide association study-identified genetic risk locus in human idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Subjects with IPF express a significantly higher level of DSP than control subjects.	Determine potential mechanisms by which DSP is regulated in lung fibrosis.	Matrigel-coated soft and stiff polyacrylamide gels were made to simulate the stiffness of normal and fibrotic lungs. Quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assay were used to evaluate transcription factor binding to the DSP promoter. Targeted DNA methylation was achieved by CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/dCas9 (deactivated CRISPR-associated protein-9 nuclease)-mediated Dnmt3A (DNA methyltransferase 3A) expression under the guidance of sequence-specific single guide RNAs.	Stiff matrix promotes DSP gene expression in both human and rodent lung epithelial cells as compared with soft matrix. A conserved region in the proximal DSP promoter is hypermethylated under soft matrix conditions and becomes hypomethylated/demethylated under stiff matrix conditions. Demethylation of this conserved DSP promoter region is associated with transactivation of transcription factor EGR1 (early growth response protein 1), resulting in EGR1-dependent DSP overexpression. Targeted DNA methylation by CRISPR/dCas9/Dnmt3A-mediated epigenome editing blocks EGR1 binding to the DSP promoter and inhibits stiff matrix-induced DSP overexpression.	DSP is a matrix stiffness-regulated mechanosensitive gene. CRISPR/dCas9-Dnmt3A-mediated epigenome editing reverses DSP overexpression by reestablishment of the epigenetic control of DSP under the mechanically homeostatic environment. It provides a useful tool for investigations of the functional role of DSP in the pathogenesis of lung fibrosis.	J Qu|L Zhu|Z Zhou|P Chen|S Liu|ML Locy|VJ Thannickal|Y Zhou
29922059	Over the last few decades, the incidence of oral cancer has gradually increased, due to the negative influence of environmental factors and also abnormalities within the genome. The main issues in oral cancer treatment consist in surpassing resistance and recurrence. However, continuous discovery of altered signaling pathways in these tumors provides valuable information for the identification of novel gene candidates targeted in personalized therapy. RNA interference (RNAi) is a natural mechanism that involves small interfering RNA (siRNA); this can be exploited in biomedical research by using natural or synthetic constructs for activation of the mechanism. Synthetic siRNA transcripts were developed as a versatile class of molecular tools that have a diverse range of programmable roles, being involved in the regulation of several biological processes, thereby providing the perspective of an alternative option to classical treatment. In this review, we summarize the latest information related to the application of siRNA in oral malignancy together with molecular aspects of the technology and also the perspective upon the delivery system. Also, the emergence of newer technologies such as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/Cas9 or transcription activator-like effector nucleases in comparison with the RNAi approach is discussed in this paper.

29921669	Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) has two critical virulence factors-a type III secretion system (T3SS) and Shiga toxins (Stxs)-that are required for the pathogen to colonize the intestine and cause diarrheal disease. Here, we carried out a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats with Cas9) loss-of-function screen to identify host loci that facilitate EHEC infection of intestinal epithelial cells. Many of the guide RNAs identified targeted loci known to be associated with sphingolipid biosynthesis, particularly for production of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3), the Stx receptor. Two loci (TM9SF2 and LAPTM4A) with largely unknown functions were also targeted. Mutations in these loci not only rescued cells from Stx-mediated cell death, but also prevented cytotoxicity associated with the EHEC T3SS. These mutations interfered with early events associated with T3SS and Stx pathogenicity, markedly reducing entry of T3SS effectors into host cells and binding of Stx. The convergence of Stx and T3SS onto overlapping host targets provides guidance for design of new host-directed therapeutic agents to counter EHEC infection.IMPORTANCE Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) has two critical virulence factors-a type III secretion system (T3SS) and Shiga toxins (Stxs)-that are required for colonizing the intestine and causing diarrheal disease. We screened a genome-wide collection of CRISPR mutants derived from intestinal epithelial cells and identified mutants with enhanced survival following EHEC infection. Many had mutations that disrupted synthesis of a subset of lipids (sphingolipids) that includes the Stx receptor globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and hence protect against Stx intoxication. Unexpectedly, we found that sphingolipids also mediate early events associated with T3SS pathogenicity. Since antibiotics are contraindicated for the treatment of EHEC, therapeutics targeting sphingolipid biosynthesis are a promising alternative, as they could provide protection against both of the pathogen's key virulence factors.

29915899	To establish stable infliximab-expressing Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with high tolerance to serum-free culture.	Bcl-2 antagonist/killer 1 (BAK1), which is a key mediator of the apoptosis pathway, was disrupted, and infliximab, which is a broadly used monoclonal antibody for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases, was incorporated into the BAK1 locus of the CHO chromosome using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas genome-editing technique. The activating effects of serum starvation on BAK1 and cytochrome C (CytC) were suppressed in the genome-edited cells, and the ability of the cells to resist the serum starvation-induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and apoptosis was increased, as indicated by the results of polymerase chain reaction (PCR), flow cytometry, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. In addition, during subsequent passages, infliximab could be stably produced in the genome-edited CHO cells, and the recombinant antibody could effectively antagonize the cytotoxic effect of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα).	A CHO cell line capable of stably expressing infliximab and adapting to serum-free culture was constructed. This work lays the foundation for the development of infliximab biosimilars.

29912950	Mutant KRAS represents one of the most frequently observed oncogenes in NSCLC, yet no therapies are approved for tumors that express activated KRAS variants. While there is strong rationale for the use of MEK inhibitors to treat tumors with activated RAS/MAPK signaling, these have proven ineffective clinically. We therefore implemented a CRISPR screening approach to identify novel agents to sensitize KRAS mutant NSCLC cells to MEK inhibitor treatment. This approach identified multiple components of the canonical RAS/MAPK pathway consistent with previous studies. In addition, we identified MAPK7 as a novel, strong hit and validated this finding using multiple orthogonal approaches including knockdown and pharmacological inhibition. We show that MAPK7 inhibition attenuates the re-activation of MAPK signaling occurring following long-term MEK inhibition, thereby illustrating that MAPK7 mediates pathway reactivation in the face of MEK inhibition. Finally, genetic knockdown of MAPK7 combined with the MEK inhibitor cobimetinib in a mutant KRAS NSCLC xenograft model to mediate improved tumor growth inhibition. These data highlight that MAPK7 represents a promising target for combination treatment with MEK inhibition in KRAS mutant NSCLC.

29912475	Nuclear organization has an important role in determining genome function; however, it is not clear how spatiotemporal organization of the genome relates to functionality. To elucidate this relationship, a method for tracking any locus of interest is desirable. Recently clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) or transcription activator-like effectors were adapted for imaging endogenous loci; however, they are mostly limited to visualization of repetitive regions. Here, we report an efficient and scalable method named SHACKTeR (Short Homology and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated Knock-in of a TetO Repeat) for live cell imaging of specific chromosomal regions without the need for a pre-existing repetitive sequence. SHACKTeR requires only two modifications to the genome: CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-in of an optimized TetO repeat and its visualization by TetR-EGFP expression. Our simplified knock-in protocol, utilizing short homology arms integrated by polymerase chain reaction, was successful at labeling 10 different loci in HCT116 cells. We also showed the feasibility of knock-in into lamina-associated, heterochromatin regions, demonstrating that these regions prefer non-homologous end joining for knock-in. Using SHACKTeR, we were able to observe DNA replication at a specific locus by long-term live cell imaging. We anticipate the general applicability and scalability of our method will enhance causative analyses between gene function and compartmentalization in a high-throughput manner.

29912402	The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated nuclease 9 (Cas9) system is a genome editing technology transforming the field of plant biology by virtue of the system's efficiency and specificity. The system has quickly evolved for many diverse applications including multiplex gene mutation, gene replacement and transcriptional control. As CRISPR/Cas9 is increasingly applied to plants, it is becoming clear that each component of the system can be modified to improve editing results. This review aims to highlight common considerations and options when conducting CRISPR/Cas9 experiments.	CL Soyars|BA Peterson|CA Burr|ZL Nimchuk
29910681	During early vertebrate embryogenesis, maternal Wnt/β-catenin signaling is thought to locally initiate expression of dorsal-specific genes. Here, eaf1 and eaf2 were identified as important maternal and zygotic modulators of Wnt signaling to initiate and specify ventral genes. Expression of ventral ved, vent, and vox was all obviously enhanced in either maternal or zygotic eaf1/2 morphants, and in both eaf1 heterozygous and homozygous mutants, but their expression was suppressed in embryos with over-expression of eaf1/2. Additionally, eaf1/2 were revealed to suppress ventral fates in embryos via Wnt/β-catenin1/Tcf signaling, complimentary to their roles in suppressing dorsal fates via Wnt/β-catenin2 signaling. Moreover, eaf1/2 were also revealed to obviously suppress the expression of axin2 induced by β-catenin2 rather than by β-catenin1, and the dorsal expression of axin2 in embryos was obviously suppressed by ectopic expression of eaf1/2. This study uncovers a novel dorsal-ventral patterning pathway, with eaf1 and eaf2 inhibiting ventral cells via suppressing Wnt/β-catenin1/Tcf signaling and inducing dorsal cells indirectly via suppressing β-catenin2-induced-axin2 on the dorsal side of embryos.

29905858	We have optimized point mutation knock-ins into zebrafish genomic sites using clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 reagents and single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides. The efficiency of knock-ins was assessed by a novel application of allele-specific polymerase chain reaction and confirmed by high-throughput sequencing. Anti-sense asymmetric oligo design was found to be the most successful optimization strategy. However, cut site proximity to the mutation and phosphorothioate oligo modifications also greatly improved knock-in efficiency. A previously unrecognized risk of off-target trans knock-ins was identified that we obviated through the development of a workflow for correct knock-in detection. Together these strategies greatly facilitate the study of human genetic diseases in zebrafish, with additional applicability to enhance CRISPR-based approaches in other animal model systems.

29904383	Human influenza virus (IAV) are among the most common pathogens to cause human respiratory infections. A better understanding on interplay between IAV and host factors may provide clues for disease prevention and control. While many viruses are known to downregulate p53 upon entering the cell to reduce the innate host antiviral response, IAV infection is unusual in that it activates p53. However, it has not been clear whether this process has proviral or antiviral effects. In this study, using human isogenic p53 wild-type and p53null A549 cells generated from the CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we observed that p53null cells exhibit significantly reduced viral propagation when infected with influenza A virus (strain A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 H1N1). Genome-wide microarray analysis revealed that p53 regulates the expression of a large set of interferon-inducible genes, among which the interferon-induced transmembrane family members IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 were most significantly downregulated by the expression of p53. Knockdown of interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) by short interfering RNAs enhanced influenza virus infectivity in p53null A549 cells, while overexpressed IFITMs in A549 cells blocked virus entry. Intriguingly, regulation of IFITMs by p53 is independent of its transcriptional activity, as the p53 short isoform Δ40p53 recapitulates IFITM regulation. Taken together, these data reveal that p53 activation by IAV is an essential step in maintaining its infectivity. This novel association between human p53 and the broad spectrum antiviral proteins, the IFITMs, demonstrates a previous mechanism employed by influenza virus to enhance its propagation via p53 inhibition of IFITMs.	B Wang|TH Lam|MK Soh|Z Ye|J Chen|EC Ren

29899105	Klebsiella pneumoniae is one of the most common nosocomial opportunistic pathogens and usually exhibits multiple-drug resistance. Phage therapy, a potential therapeutic to replace or supplement antibiotics, has attracted much attention. However, very few Klebsiella phages have been well characterized because of the lack of efficient genome-editing tools. Here, Cas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes and a single guide RNA (sgRNA) were used to modify a virulent Klebsiella bacteriophage, phiKpS2. We first evaluated the distribution of sgRNA activity in phages and proved that it is largely inconsistent with the predicted activity from current models trained on eukaryotic cell data sets. A simple CRISPR-based phage genome-editing procedure was developed based on the discovery that homologous arms as short as 30 to 60 bp were sufficient to introduce point mutation, gene deletion, and swap. We also demonstrated that weak sgRNAs could be used for precise phage genome editing but failed to select random recombinants, possibly because inefficient cleavage can be tolerated through continuous repair by homologous recombination with the uncut genomes. Small frameshift deletion was proved to be an efficient way to evaluate the essentiality of phage genes. By using the abovementioned strategies, a putative promoter and nine genes of phiKpS2 were successfully deleted. Interestingly, the holin gene can be deleted with little effect on phiKpS2 infection, but the reason is not yet clear. This study established an efficient, time-saving, and cost-effective procedure for phage genome editing, which is expected to significantly promote the development of bacteriophage therapy.IMPORTANCE In the present study, we have addressed efficient, time-saving, and cost-effective CRISPR-based phage genome editing of Klebsiella phage, which has the potential to significantly expand our knowledge of phage-host interactions and to promote applications of phage therapy. The distribution of sgRNA activity was first evaluated in phages. Short homologous arms were proven to be enough to introduce point mutation, small frameshift deletion, gene deletion, and swap into phages, and weak sgRNAs were proven useful for precise phage genome editing but failed to select random recombinants, all of which makes the CRISPR-based phage genome-editing method easier to use.

29898980	Cryptococcus neoformans and related species are encapsulated basidiomycetous fungi that cause meningoencephalitis in individuals with immune deficiency. This pathogen has a tractable genetic system; however, gene disruption via electroporation remains difficult, while biolistic transformation is often limited by lack of multiple genetic markers and the high initial cost of equipment. The approach using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) has become the technology of choice for gene editing in many organisms due to its simplicity, efficiency, and versatility. The technique has been successfully demonstrated in C. neoformans and Cryptococcus deneoformans in which two DNA plasmids expressing either the Streptococcus pyogenesCAS9 gene or the guide RNA (gRNA) were employed. However, potential adverse effects due to constitutive expression and the time-consuming process of constructing vectors to express each gRNA remain as a primary barrier for wide adaptation. This report describes the delivery of preassembled CRISPR-Cas9-gRNA ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) via electroporation that is able to generate edited mutant alleles. RNP-mediated CRISPR-Cas9 was used to replace the wild-type GIB2 gene encoding a Gβ-like/RACK1 Gib2 protein with a gib2::NAT allele via homologous recombination in both C. neoformans and C. deneoformans In addition, a DNA plasmid (pCnCas9:U6-gRNA) that expresses both Cas9 and gRNA, allowing for convenient yet low-cost DNA-mediated gene editing, is described. pCnCas9:U6-gRNA contains an endogenous U6 promoter for gRNA expression and restriction sites for one-step insertion of a gRNA. These approaches and resources provide new opportunities to accelerate genetic studies of Cryptococcus species.IMPORTANCE For genetic studies of the Cryptococcus genus, generation of mutant strains is often hampered by a limited number of selectable genetic markers, the tedious process of vector construction, side effects, and other limitations, such as the high cost of acquiring a particle delivery system. CRISPR-Cas9 technology has been demonstrated in Cryptococcus for genome editing. However, it remains labor-intensive and time-consuming since it requires the identification of a suitable type III RNA polymerase promoter for gRNA expression. In addition, there may be potential adverse effects caused by constitutive expressions of Cas9 and gRNA. Here, I report the use of a ribonucleoprotein-mediated CRISPR-Cas9 technique for genome editing of C. neoformans and related species. Together with the custom-constructed pCnCas9:U6-gRNA vector that allows low-cost and time-saving DNA-based CRISPR-Cas9, my approach adds to the molecular toolbox for dissecting the molecular mechanism of pathogenesis in this important group of fungal pathogens.

29898790	The engineered DNA-binding molecule-mediated chromatin immunoprecipitation (enChIP) technology enables purification of specific genomic regions interacting with their associated molecules. In enChIP, the locus to be purified is first tagged with engineered DNA-binding molecules. An example of such engineered DNA-binding molecules to tag the locus of interest is the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) system, consisting of a catalytically-inactive form of Cas9 (dCas9) and guide RNA (gRNA). Subsequently, the tagged locus is subjected to affinity purification for identification of interacting molecules. In our previous studies, we developed enChIP systems for analysis of mammalian genome functions. Here, we developed an enChIP system to analyze bacterial genome functions.	We generated a plasmid inducibly expressing Streptococcus pyogenes dCas9 fused to a 3xFLAG-tag (3xFLAG-dCas9) in bacteria. Inducible expression of 3xFLAG-dCas9 in Escherichia coli was confirmed by immunoblot analysis. We were able to purify specific genomic regions of E. coli preserving their molecular interactions. The system is potentially useful for analysis of interactions between specific genomic regions and their associated molecules in bacterial cells to understand genome functions such as transcription, DNA repair, and DNA recombination.

29895256	The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-associated protein 9 or CRISPR/Cas9 system is one of the hottest topics discussed lately due to its robustness and effectiveness in genome editing. The technology has been widely used in life science research including microbial, plant, animal, and human cell studies. Combined with the pluripotency of stem cells, the technology represents a powerful tool to generate various cell types for disease modeling, drug screening, toxicology, and targeted therapies. Generally, the CRISPR/Cas9 system has been applied in genetic modification of pluripotent or multipotent stem cells, after which the cells are differentiated into specific cell types and used for functional analysis or even clinical transplantation. Recent advancement in CRISPR/Cas9 technology has widened the scope of stem cell research and its therapeutic application. This review provides an overview of the current application and the prospect of CRISPR/Cas9 technology, particularly in stem cell research and therapy.

29893914	Expression of CRISPR-Cas systems is a prerequisite for their defensive role against invading genetic elements. Yet, much remains unknown about how this crucial step is regulated. We describe a new mechanism controlling CRISPR-cas expression, which requires an extracytoplasmic function (ECF) σ factor (DdvS), its membrane-bound anti-σ (DdvA) and a global regulatory complex (CarD-CarG). Transcriptomic analyses revealed that the DdvS/CarD/CarG-dependent regulon comprises a type III-B CRISPR-Cas system in Myxococcus xanthus. We mapped four DdvS-driven CarD/CarG-dependent promoters, with one lying immediately upstream of the cas cluster. Consistent with direct action, DdvS and CarD-CarG localize at these promoters in vivo. The cas genes are transcribed as a polycistronic mRNA that reads through the leader into the CRISPR array, a putative σA-dependent promoter in the leader having negligible activity in vivo. Consequently, expression of the entire CRISPR-Cas system and mature CRISPR-RNA (crRNA) production is DdvS/CarD/CarG-dependent. DdvA likely uses its large C-terminal domain to sense and transduce the extracytoplasmic signal triggering CRISPR-cas expression, which we show is not starvation-induced multicellular development. An ECF-σ/anti-σ pair and a global regulatory complex provide an effective mechanism to coordinate signal-sensing with production of precursor crRNA, its processing Cas6 endoribonuclease and other Cas proteins for mature crRNA biogenesis and interference.

29891558	Polycomb-repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is a histone methyltransferase that promotes epigenetic gene silencing, but the dynamics of its interactions with chromatin are largely unknown. Here we quantitatively measured the binding of PRC2 to chromatin in human cancer cells. Genome editing of a HaloTag into the endogenous EZH2 and SUZ12 loci and single-particle tracking revealed that ∼80% of PRC2 rapidly diffuses through the nucleus, while ∼20% is chromatin-bound. Short-term treatment with a small molecule inhibitor of the EED-H3K27me3 interaction had no immediate effect on the chromatin residence time of PRC2. In contrast, separation-of-function mutants of SUZ12, which still form the core PRC2 complex but cannot bind accessory proteins, revealed a major contribution of AEBP2 and PCL homolog proteins to chromatin binding. We therefore quantified the dynamics of this chromatin-modifying complex in living cells and separated the contributions of H3K27me3 histone marks and various PRC2 subunits to recruitment of PRC2 to chromatin.

29890193	Strategies for biotechnology must take account of opportunities for research, innovation and business growth. At a regional level, public-private collaborations provide potential for such growth and the creation of centres of excellence. By considering recent progress in areas such as genomics, healthcare diagnostics, synthetic biology, gene editing and bio-digital technologies, opportunities for smart, strategic and specialised investment are discussed. These opportunities often involve convergent or disruptive technologies, combining for example elements of pharma-science, molecular biology, bioinformatics and novel device development to enhance biotechnology and the life sciences. Analytical applications use novel devices in mobile health, predictive diagnostics and stratified medicine. Synthetic biology provides opportunities for new product development and increased efficiency for existing processes. Successful centres of excellence should promote public-private business partnerships, clustering and global collaborations based on excellence, smart strategies and innovation if they are to remain sustainable in the longer term.

29885329	With the emergence of CRISPR technology, targeted editing of a wide variety of genomes is no longer an abstract hypothetical, but occurs regularly. As application areas of CRISPR are exceeding beyond research and biomedical therapies, new and existing ethical concerns abound throughout the global community about the appropriate scope of the systems' use. Here we review fundamental ethical issues including the following: 1) the extent to which CRISPR use should be permitted; 2) access to CRISPR applications; 3) whether a regulatory framework(s) for clinical research involving human subjects might accommodate all types of human genome editing, including editing of the germline; and 4) whether international regulations governing inappropriate CRISPR utilization should be crafted and publicized. We conclude that moral decision making should evolve as the science of genomic engineering advances and hold that it would be reasonable for national and supranational legislatures to consider evidence-based regulation of certain CRISPR applications for the betterment of human health and progress.

29884993	Staphylococcus aureus needs to control the position and timing of cell division and cell wall synthesis to maintain its spherical shape. We identified two membrane proteins, named CozEa and CozEb, which together are important for proper cell division in S. aureus. CozEa and CozEb are homologs of the cell elongation regulator CozESpn of Streptococcus pneumoniae. While cozEa and cozEb were not essential individually, the ΔcozEaΔcozEb double mutant was lethal. To study the functions of cozEa and cozEb, we constructed a CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) system for S. aureus, allowing transcriptional knockdown of essential genes. CRISPRi knockdown of cozEa in the ΔcozEb strain (and vice versa) causes cell morphological defects and aberrant nucleoid staining, showing that cozEa and cozEb have overlapping functions and are important for normal cell division. We found that CozEa and CozEb interact with and possibly influence localization of the cell division protein EzrA. Furthermore, the CozE-EzrA interaction is conserved in S. pneumoniae, and cell division is mislocalized in cozESpn -depleted S. pneumoniae cells. Together, our results show that CozE proteins mediate control of cell division in S. aureus and S. pneumoniae, likely via interactions with key cell division proteins such as EzrA.

29884474	The CRISPR technology is rapidly transforming the field of liver research by its versatility and easy use. In vivo gene editing of hepatocytes in adult mice can be achieved using a broad toolbox for both fundamental research and development of therapeutic strategies for future clinical applications. Recent studies showed that CRISPR has a real potential to treat hereditary liver diseases as well as virally induced pathologies. This short review recapitulates very recent advancements regarding the use of CRISPR in liver research and therapy.	R Loesch|C Desbois-Mouthon|S Colnot
29884309	CD9, a member of the tetraspanin superfamily, has been implicated in regulating various physiological processes, including cell motility, adhesion, apoptosis and metastasis. Recently, interleukin-16 (IL-16), a pro-inflammatory cytokine released by normal airway and alveolar epithelial cells, has been implicated as a possible ligand for CD9 as an alternative receptor. In this study, using A549 cells as a model of human alveolar epithelium, CD9 expression was ablated using CRISPR/Cas technology. Decreased expression of CD9 mRNA and protein levels was confirmed through RT-qPCR and flow cytometry, respectively. Individual clones were generated that expressed high levels of CD9 (wild-type, WT) or significantly less CD9 (knockdown, KD). Both wild-type and knockdown A549 cell migration was quantified using a FluoroBloc transwell chemotaxis assay. Our results indicate that wild-type A549 cells migrated towards chemoattractants. Moreover, CD9 expression was required in this process since the CD9 knockdown cells had a significantly reduced migration towards growth serum and IL-16. These results support the migratory properties for CD9 in human lung cells and support the hypothesis that CD9 serves as an alternative receptor for IL-16.	DJ Blake|JD Martiszus|TH Lone|SD Fenster
29883605	To achieve adaptive and heritable immunity against viruses and other mobile genetic elements, CRISPR-Cas systems must capture and store short DNA fragments (spacers) from these foreign elements into host genomic CRISPR arrays. This process is catalyzed by conserved Cas1/Cas2 integration complexes, but the specific roles of another highly conserved protein linked to spacer acquisition, the Cas4 nuclease, are just now emerging. Here, we show that two Cas4 nucleases (Cas4-1 and Cas4-2) play critical roles in CRISPR spacer acquisition in Pyrococcus furiosus. The nuclease activities of both Cas4 proteins are required to process protospacers to the correct size. Cas4-1 specifies the upstream PAM (protospacer adjacent motif), while Cas4-2 specifies the conserved downstream motif. Both Cas4 proteins ensure CRISPR spacer integration in a defined orientation leading to CRISPR immunity. Collectively, these findings provide in vivo evidence for critical roles of Cas4 nucleases in protospacer generation and functional spacer integration at CRISPR arrays.

Some of these, such as restriction endonucleases and CRISPR-Cas, have revolutionized genome editing methodology. A systematic strategy combining computation and experiment led to discovery of ten new defense systems that remain to be characterized mechanistically.	EV Koonin
29883600	Cas4 nucleases are conserved factors in many CRISPR systems, yet their molecular role has remained enigmatic. In this issue of Molecular Cell, Shiimori et al. (2018) report that two Cas4 nucleases together determine the size, orientation, and PAM for foreign DNA snippets acquired by CRISPR loci as immunological memory.	Z Hou|Y Zhang
29882154	Comparing the functional gene composition of soils at opposite extremes of environmental gradients may allow testing of hypotheses about community and ecosystem function. Here, we were interested in comparing how tropical microbial ecosystems differ from those of polar climates. We sampled several sites in the equatorial rainforest of Malaysia and Brunei, and the high Arctic of Svalbard, Canada, and Greenland, comparing the composition and the functional attributes of soil biota between the two extremes of latitude, using shotgun metagenomic Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencing. Based upon "classical" views of how tropical and higher latitude ecosystems differ, we made a series of predictions as to how various gene function categories would differ in relative abundance between tropical and polar environments. Results showed that in some respects our predictions were correct: the polar samples had higher relative abundance of dormancy related genes, and lower relative abundance of genes associated with respiration, and with metabolism of aromatic compounds. The network complexity of the Arctic was also lower than the tropics. However, in various other respects, the pattern was not as predicted; there were no differences in relative abundance of stress response genes or in genes associated with secondary metabolism. Conversely, CRISPR genes, phage-related genes, and virulence disease and defense genes, were unexpectedly more abundant in the Arctic, suggesting more intense biotic interaction. Also, eukaryote diversity and bacterial diversity were higher in the Arctic of Svalbard compared to tropical Brunei, which is consistent with what may expected from amplicon studies in terms of the higher pH of the Svalbard soil. Our results in some respects confirm expectations of how tropical versus polar nature may differ, and in other respects challenge them.

29878242	Genome editing technology based on engineered nucleases has been increasingly applied for targeted modification of genes in a variety of cell types and organisms. However, the methods currently used for evaluating the editing efficiency still suffer from many limitations, including preferential detection of some mutation types, sensitivity to polymorphisms that hamper mismatch detection, lack of multiplex capability, or sensitivity to assay conditions. Here, we describe qEva-CRISPR, a new quantitative method that overcomes these limitations and allows simultaneous (multiplex) analysis of CRISPR/Cas9-induced modifications in a target and the corresponding off-targets or in several different targets. We demonstrate all of the advantages of the qEva-CRISPR method using a number of sgRNAs targeting the TP53, VEGFA, CCR5, EMX1 and HTT genes in different cell lines and under different experimental conditions. Unlike other methods, qEva-CRISPR detects all types of mutations, including point mutations and large deletions, and its sensitivity does not depend on the mutation type. Moreover, this approach allows for successful analysis of targets located in 'difficult' genomic regions. In conclusion, qEva-CRISPR may become a method of choice for unbiased sgRNA screening to evaluate experimental conditions that affect genome editing or to distinguish homology-directed repair from non-homologous end joining.

29874914	Photoautotrophic production of fuels and chemicals by cyanobacteria typically gives lower volumetric productivities and titers than heterotrophic production. Cyanobacteria cultures become light limited above an optimal cell density, so that this substrate is not supplied to all cells sufficiently. Here, we investigate genetic strategies for a two-phase cultivation, where biofuel-producing Synechocystis cultures are limited to an optimal cell density through inducible CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) repression of cell growth. Fixed CO2 is diverted to ethanol or n-butanol. Among the most successful strategies was partial repression of citrate synthase gltA. Strong repression (>90%) of gltA at low culture densities increased carbon partitioning to n-butanol 5-fold relative to a nonrepression strain, but sacrificed volumetric productivity due to severe growth restriction. CO2 fixation continued for at least 3 days after growth was arrested. By targeting sgRNAs to different regions of the gltA gene, we could modulate GltA expression and carbon partitioning between growth and product to increase both specific and volumetric productivity. These growth arrest strategies can be useful for improving performance of other photoautotrophic processes.	K Shabestary|J Anfelt|E Ljungqvist|M Jahn|L Yao|EP Hudson
29874158	Xanthomonas fragariae is a quarantine organism in Europe, causing angular leaf spots on strawberry plants. It is spreading worldwide in strawberry-producing regions due to import of plant material through trade and human activities. In order to resolve the population structure at the strain level, we have employed high-resolution molecular typing tools on a comprehensive strain collection representing global and temporal distribution of the pathogen. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat regions (CRISPRs) and variable number of tandem repeats (VNTRs) were identified within the reference genome of X. fragariae LMG 25863 as a potential source of variation. Strains from our collection were whole-genome sequenced and used in order to identify variable spacers and repeats for discriminative purpose. CRISPR spacer analysis and multiple-locus VNTR analysis (MLVA) displayed a congruent population structure, in which two major groups and a total of four subgroups were revealed. The two main groups were genetically separated before the first X. fragariae isolate was described and are potentially responsible for the worldwide expansion of the bacterial disease. Three primer sets were designed for discriminating CRISPR-associated markers in order to streamline group determination of novel isolates. Overall, this study describes typing methods to discriminate strains and monitor the pathogen population structure, more especially in the view of a new outbreak of the pathogen.

29872908	The ability to predict phenotype from genotype has been an elusive goal for the biological sciences for several decades. Progress decoding genotype-phenotype relationships has been hampered by the challenge of introducing precise genetic changes to specific genomic locations. Here we provide a comparative review of the major techniques that have been historically used to make genetic changes in cells as well as the development of the CRISPR technology which enabled the ability to make marker-free disruptions in endogenous genomic locations. We also discuss how the achievement of truly scarless genome editing has required further adjustments of the original CRISPR method. We conclude by examining recently developed genome editing methods which are not reliant on the induction of a DNA double strand break and discuss the future of both genome engineering and the study of genotype-phenotype relationships.

29871865	Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked muscle-wasting disorder caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene, with an incidence of 1 in 3500 in new male births. Mdx mice are widely used as an animal model for DMD. However, these mice do not faithfully recapitulate DMD patients in many aspects, rendering the preclinical findings in this model questionable. Although larger animal models of DMD, such as dogs and pigs, have been generated, usage of these animals is expensive and only limited to several facilities in the world. Here, we report the generation of a rabbit model of DMD by co-injection of Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA targeting exon 51 into rabbit zygotes. The DMD knockout (KO) rabbits exhibit the typical phenotypes of DMD, including severely impaired physical activity, elevated serum creatine kinase levels, and progressive muscle necrosis and fibrosis. Moreover, clear pathology was also observed in the diaphragm and heart at 5 months of age, similar to DMD patients. Echocardiography recording showed that the DMD KO rabbits had chamber dilation with decreased ejection fraction and fraction shortening. In conclusion, this novel rabbit DMD model generated with the CRISPR/Cas9 system mimics the histopathological and functional defects in DMD patients, and could be valuable for preclinical studies.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.

29863336	Clostridium difficile is often the primary cause of nosocomial diarrhea, leading to thousands of deaths annually worldwide. The availability of an efficient genome editing tool for C. difficile is essential to understanding its pathogenic mechanism and physiological behavior. Although CRISPR-Cas9 has been extensively employed for genome engineering in various organisms, large gene deletion and multiplex genome editing is still challenging in microorganisms with underdeveloped genetic engineering tools. Here, we describe a streamlined CRISPR-Cpf1-based toolkit to achieve precise deletions of fur, tetM, and ermB1/2 in C. difficile with high efficiencies. All of these genes are relevant to important phenotypes (including iron uptake, antibiotics resistance, and toxin production) as related to the pathogenesis of C. difficile infection (CDI). Furthermore, we were able to delete an extremely large locus of 49.2-kb comprising a phage genome (phiCD630-2) and realized multiplex genome editing in a single conjugation with high efficiencies (simultaneous deletion of cwp66 and tcdA). Our work highlighted the first application of CRISPR-Cpf1 for multiplexed genome editing and extremely large gene deletion in C. difficile, which are both crucial for understanding the pathogenic mechanism of C. difficile and developing strategies to fight against CDI. In addition, for the DNA cloning, we developed a one-step-assembly protocol along with a Python-based algorithm for automatic primer design, shortening the time for plasmid construction to half that of conventional procedures. The approaches we developed herein are easily and broadly applicable to other microorganisms. Our results provide valuable guidance for establishing CRISPR-Cpf1 as a versatile genome engineering tool in prokaryotic cells.	W Hong|J Zhang|G Cui|L Wang|Y Wang
29857552	Burkholderia cenocepacia, is a Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen that belongs to Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC) group. BCC representatives carry various pathogenicity factors and can infect humans and plants. Phages as bacterial viruses play a significant role in biodiversity and ecological balance in the environment. Specifically, horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and lysogenic conversion (temperate phages) influence microbial diversification and fitness. In this study, we describe the prevalence and gene content of prophages in 16 fully sequenced B. cenocepacia genomes stored in NCBI database. The analysis was conducted in silico by manual and automatic approaches. Sixty-three potential prophage regions were found and classified as intact, incomplete, questionable, and artifacts. The regions were investigated for the presence of known virulence factors, resulting in the location of sixteen potential pathogenicity mechanisms, including toxin⁻antitoxin systems (TA), Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) transporters and responsible for drug resistance. Investigation of the region's closest neighborhood highlighted three groups of genes with the highest occurrence-tRNA-Arg, dehydrogenase family proteins, and ABC transporter substrate-binding proteins. Searches for antiphage systems such as BacteRiophage EXclusion (BREX) and Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) in the analyzed strains suggested 10 sequence sets of CRISPR elements. Our results suggest that intact B. cenocepacia prophages may provide an evolutionary advantage to the bacterium, while domesticated prophages may help to maintain important genes.

29857168	DNA editing using CRISPR/Cas has emerged as a potential treatment for diseases caused by pathogenic human DNA viruses. One potential target is HIV-1, which replicates via a chromosomally integrated DNA provirus. While CRISPR/Cas can protect T cells from de novo HIV-1 infection, HIV-1 frequently becomes resistant due to mutations in the chosen single guide RNA (sgRNA) target site. To address this problem, we asked whether an sgRNA targeted to a conserved, functionally critical HIV-1 sequence might prevent the selection of escape mutants. We report that two sgRNAs specific for the HIV-1 transactivation response (TAR) element produce opposite results: the TAR2 sgRNA rapidly selects for mutants that retain TAR function, but are no longer inhibited by Cas9, while the TAR1 sgRNA fails to select any replication competent TAR mutants, most probably because it is targeted to a region of TAR that is disrupted by even minor mutations.

29853845	Inherited retinal dystrophies (IRDs) are a leading cause of visual impairment in the developing world. These conditions present an irreversible dysfunction or loss of neural retinal cells, which significantly impacts quality of life. Due to the anatomical accessibility and immunoprivileged status of the eye, ophthalmological research has been at the forefront of innovative and advanced gene- and cell-based therapies, both of which represent great potential as therapeutic treatments for IRD patients. However, due to a genetic and clinical heterogeneity, certain IRDs are not candidates for these approaches. New advances in the field of genome editing using Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated protein (Cas) have provided an accurate and efficient way to edit the human genome and represent an appealing alternative for treating IRDs. We provide a brief update on current gene augmentation therapies for retinal dystrophies. Furthermore, we discuss recent advances in the field of genome editing and stem cell technologies, which together enable precise and personalized therapies for patients. Lastly, we highlight current technological limitations and barriers that need to be overcome before this technology can become a viable treatment option for patients.	C Sanjurjo-Soriano|V Kalatzis
29844520	Gene tagging with fluorescent proteins is essential for investigations of the dynamic properties of cellular proteins. CRISPR-Cas9 technology is a powerful tool for inserting fluorescent markers into all alleles of the gene of interest (GOI) and allows functionality and physiological expression of the fusion protein. It is essential to evaluate such genome-edited cell lines carefully in order to preclude off-target effects caused by (i) incorrect insertion of the fluorescent protein, (ii) perturbation of the fusion protein by the fluorescent proteins or (iii) nonspecific genomic DNA damage by CRISPR-Cas9. In this protocol, we provide a step-by-step description of our systematic pipeline to generate and validate homozygous fluorescent knock-in cell lines.We have used the paired Cas9D10A nickase approach to efficiently insert tags into specific genomic loci via homology-directed repair (HDR) with minimal off-target effects. It is time-consuming and costly to perform whole-genome sequencing of each cell clone to check for spontaneous genetic variations occurring in mammalian cell lines. Therefore, we have developed an efficient validation pipeline of the generated cell lines consisting of junction PCR, Southern blotting analysis, Sanger sequencing, microscopy, western blotting analysis and live-cell imaging for cell-cycle dynamics. This protocol takes between 6 and 9 weeks. With this protocol, up to 70% of the targeted genes can be tagged homozygously with fluorescent proteins, thus resulting in physiological levels and phenotypically functional expression of the fusion proteins.

29812974	Numerous feasible methods for inserting large fragments of exogenous DNA sequences into the zebrafish genome have been developed, as has genome editing technology using programmable nucleases. However, the coding sequences of targeted endogenous genes are disrupted, and the expression patterns of inserted exogenous genes cannot completely recapitulate those of endogenous genes. Here we describe the establishment of a novel strategy for endogenous promoter-driven and microhomology-mediated end-joining-dependent integration of a donor vector using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) 9. We successfully integrated mCherry into the final coding sequence of targeted genes to generate seamless transgenic zebrafish lines with high efficiency. This novel seamless transgenesis technique not only maintained the integrity of the endogenous gene but also did not disrupt the function of targeted gene. Therefore, our microhomology-mediated end-joining-mediated transgenesis strategy may have broader applications in gene therapy. Moreover, this novel seamless gene-editing strategy in zebrafish provides a valuable new transgenesis technique, which was driven by endogenous promoters and in vivo animal reporter modes for translational medicine. It is expected to be a standard gene-editing technique in the field of zebrafish, leading to some important breakthroughs for studies in early embryogenesis.-Luo, J.-J., Bian, W.-P., Liu, Y., Huang, H.-Y., Yin, Q., Yang, X.-J., Pei, D.-S.

29809142	The CRISPR-Cas9 targeted nuclease technology allows the insertion of genetic modifications with single base-pair precision. The preference of mammalian cells to repair Cas9-induced DNA double-strand breaks via error-prone end-joining pathways rather than via homology-directed repair mechanisms, however, leads to relatively low rates of precise editing from donor DNA. Here we show that spatial and temporal co-localization of the donor template and Cas9 via covalent linkage increases the correction rates up to 24-fold, and demonstrate that the effect is mainly caused by an increase of donor template concentration in the nucleus. Enhanced correction rates were observed in multiple cell types and on different genomic loci, suggesting that covalently linking the donor template to the Cas9 complex provides advantages for clinical applications where high-fidelity repair is desired.

29806481	In this review, we introduce current developments in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), site-specific nuclease (SSN)-mediated genome editing tools, and the combined application of these two novel technologies in biomedical research and therapeutic trials. The sustainable pluripotent property of iPSCs in vitro not only provides unlimited cell sources for basic research but also benefits precision medicines for human diseases. In addition, rapidly evolving SSN tools efficiently tailor genetic manipulations for exploring gene functions and can be utilized to correct genetic defects of congenital diseases in the near future. Combining iPSC and SSN technologies will create new reliable human disease models with isogenic backgrounds in vitro and provide new solutions for cell replacement and precise therapies.

29804829	The RNA-guided DNA endonuclease Cas9 is a powerful tool for genome editing. Little is known about the kinetics and fidelity of the double-strand break (DSB) repair process that follows a Cas9 cutting event in living cells. Here, we developed a strategy to measure the kinetics of DSB repair for single loci in human cells. Quantitative modeling of repaired DNA in time series after Cas9 activation reveals variable and often slow repair rates, with half-life times up to ∼10 hr. Furthermore, repair of the DSBs tends to be error prone. Both classical and microhomology-mediated end joining pathways contribute to the erroneous repair. Estimation of their individual rate constants indicates that the balance between these two pathways changes over time and can be altered by additional ionizing radiation. Our approach provides quantitative insights into DSB repair kinetics and fidelity in single loci and indicates that Cas9-induced DSBs are repaired in an unusual manner.

29803706	Structural maintenance of chromosome (Smc) protein complex (condensin) plays a central role in organizing and compacting chromosomes, which determines DNA-binding activity and gene expression; however, the role of condensin Smc in innate immunity and inflammation remains largely unknown. Through a high-throughput screening of the epigenetic modifiers, we identified Smc4, a core subunit of condensin, to potentially promote inflammatory innate immune response. Knockdown or deficiency of Smc4 inhibited TLR- or virus-triggered production of proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNF-α and IFN-β in macrophages. Mice with Smc4 knockdown were less susceptible to sepsis. Mechanistically, Smc4 enhanced NEMO transcription by recruiting H4K5ac to and increasing H4K5 acetylation of nemo promoter, leading to innate signals-triggered more potent activation of NF-κB and IRF3 pathways. Therefore, Smc4 promotes inflammatory innate immune responses by enhancing NEMO transcription, and our data add insight to epigenetic regulation of innate immunity and inflammation, and outline potential target for controlling inflammatory diseases.

29802757	Despite great efforts to control and modify gene expression of Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells by conventional genetic engineering approaches, i.e. overexpression or knockdown/-out, subclonal variation, induced unknown regulatory effects as well as overexpression stress are still a major hurdle for efficient cell line engineering and for unequivocal characterization of gene function. The use of epigenetic modulators - key players in CHO clonal heterogeneity - has only been marginally addressed so far. Here, we present the application of an alternative engineering strategy in CHO cells by utilizing targeted epigenetic editing tools that enable the turning-on or -off of genes without altering the genomic sequence. The present, but silent beta-galactoside alpha-2,6-sialyltransferase 1 (ST6GAL1) gene is activated by targeting the catalytic domain (CD) of Ten-Eleven Translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase 1 (TET1) via deactivated Cas9 (dCas9) to its methylated promoter. Stable upregulation in up to 60% of transfected cells is achieved over a time span of more than 80 days. No difference in growth and recombinant protein productivity is observed between activated and control cultures. Re-silencing by targeted methylation via DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) 3A-CD resulted in an up to 5.4-fold reduction of ST6GAL1 mRNA expression in ST6GAL1 expressing cells. This proof-of-concept demonstrates the feasibility of using epigenetic editing tools to efficiently modulate gene expression and provide a promising complement to conventional genetic engineering in CHO cells.

29801422	Gene therapy has long held promise to correct a variety of human diseases and defects. Discovery of the Clustered Regularly-Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR), the mechanism of the CRISPR-based prokaryotic adaptive immune system (CRISPR-associated system, Cas), and its repurposing into a potent gene editing tool has revolutionized the field of molecular biology and generated excitement for new and improved gene therapies. Additionally, the simplicity and flexibility of the CRISPR/Cas9 site-specific nuclease system has led to its widespread use in many biological research areas including development of model cell lines, discovering mechanisms of disease, identifying disease targets, development of transgene animals and plants, and transcriptional modulation. In this review, we present the brief history and basic mechanisms of the CRISPR/Cas9 system and its predecessors (ZFNs and TALENs), lessons learned from past human gene therapy efforts, and recent modifications of CRISPR/Cas9 to provide functions beyond gene editing. We introduce several factors that influence CRISPR/Cas9 efficacy which must be addressed before effective in vivo human gene therapy can be realized. The focus then turns to the most difficult barrier to potential in vivo use of CRISPR/Cas9, delivery. We detail the various cargos and delivery vehicles reported for CRISPR/Cas9, including physical delivery methods (e.g. microinjection; electroporation), viral delivery methods (e.g. adeno-associated virus (AAV); full-sized adenovirus and lentivirus), and non-viral delivery methods (e.g. liposomes; polyplexes; gold particles), and discuss their relative merits. We also examine several technologies that, while not currently reported for CRISPR/Cas9 delivery, appear to have promise in this field. The therapeutic potential of CRISPR/Cas9 is vast and will only increase as the technology and its delivery improves.	CA Lino|JC Harper|JP Carney|JA Timlin

29789544	Limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2L (LGMD2L) and Miyoshi myopathy type 3 (MMD3) are autosomal recessive muscular dystrophy caused by mutations in the gene encoding anoctamin-5 (ANO5), which belongs to the anoctamin protein family. Two independent lines of mice with complete disruption of ANO5 transcripts did not exhibit overt muscular dystrophy phenotypes; instead, one of these mice was observed to present with some abnormality in sperm motility. In contrast, a third line of ANO5-knockout (KO) mice with residual expression of truncated ANO5 expression was reported to display defective membrane repair and very mild muscle pathology. Many of the ANO5-related patients carry point mutations or small insertions/deletions (indels) in the ANO5 gene. To more closely mimic the human ANO5 mutations, we engineered mutant ANO5 rabbits via co-injection of Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA into the zygotes. CRISPR-mediated small indels in the exon 12 and/or 13 in the mutant rabbits lead to the development of typical signs of muscular dystrophy with increased serum creatine kinase (CK), muscle necrosis, regeneration, fatty replacement and fibrosis. This novel ANO5 mutant rabbit model would be useful in studying the disease pathogenesis and therapeutic treatments for ANO5-deficient muscular dystrophy.

In a 29-year-old patient with rapid disease progression, we discovered a novel mutation (Q108P) in a conserved residue within the coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix (CHCH) domain. The aggressive clinical phenotype prompted us to probe its pathogenicity. Unlike the wild-type protein, mitochondrial import of CHCHD10 Q108P was blocked nearly completely resulting in diffuse cytoplasmic localization and reduced stability. Other CHCHD10 variants reported in patients showed impaired mitochondrial import (C122R) or clustering within mitochondria (especially G66V and E127K) often associated with reduced expression. Truncation experiments suggest mitochondrial import of CHCHD10 is mediated by the CHCH domain rather than the proposed N-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal. Knockdown of Mia40, which introduces disulfide bonds into CHCH domain proteins, blocked mitochondrial import of CHCHD10. Overexpression of Mia40 rescued mitochondrial import of CHCHD10 Q108P by enhancing disulfide-bond formation. Since reduction in CHCHD10 inhibits respiration, mutations in its CHCH domain may cause aggressive disease by impairing mitochondrial import. Our data suggest Mia40 upregulation as a potential therapeutic salvage pathway.

29786424	Functional genomics studies in minimal mycoplasma cells enable unobstructed access to some of the most fundamental processes in biology. Conventional transposon bombardment and gene knockout approaches often fail to reveal functions of genes that are essential for viability, where lethality precludes phenotypic characterization. Conditional inactivation of genes is effective for characterizing functions central to cell growth and division, but tools are limited for this purpose in mycoplasmas. Here we demonstrate systems for inducible repression of gene expression based on clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-mediated interference (CRISPRi) in Mycoplasma pneumoniae and synthetic Mycoplasma mycoides, two organisms with reduced genomes actively used in systems biology studies. In the synthetic cell, we also demonstrate inducible gene expression for the first time. Time-course data suggest rapid kinetics and reversible engagement of CRISPRi. Targeting of six selected endogenous genes with this system results in lowered transcript levels or reduced growth rates that agree with lack or shortage of data in previous transposon bombardment studies, and now produces actual cells to analyze. The ksgA gene encodes a methylase that modifies 16S rRNA, rendering it vulnerable to inhibition by the antibiotic kasugamycin. Targeting the ksgA gene with CRISPRi removes the lethal effect of kasugamycin and enables cell growth, thereby establishing specific and effective gene modulation with our system. The facile methods for conditional gene activation and inactivation in mycoplasmas open the door to systematic dissection of genetic programs at the core of cellular life.

29786090	Despite widespread use of CRISPR, comprehensive data on the frequency and impact of Cas9-mediated off-targets in modified rodents are limited. Here we present deep-sequencing data from 81 genome-editing projects on mouse and rat genomes at 1,423 predicted off-target sites, 32 of which were confirmed, and show that high-fidelity Cas9 versions reduced off-target mutation rates in vivo. Using whole-genome sequencing data from ten mouse embryos, treated with a single guide RNA (sgRNA), and from their genetic parents, we found 43 off-targets, 30 of which were predicted by an adapted version of GUIDE-seq.

29785946	Researches on CRISPR/Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated genes) systems, that are adaptive immunity systems encoded by prokaryotes, have promoted the development of new genome-editing tools. Bacteriophages are not only the driving elements for the evolution of prokaryotes' CRISPR arrays, but also the targets of the CRISPR/Cas systems. Studies on functional genomics of bacteriophages have been lagging behind the discovery of new phage strains and the sequencing of their genomes. CRISPR/Cas systems-driven genome engineering of bacteriophages provides a novel approach for bacteriophage functional genomics. This review comments on a few profound cases of genome engineering of bacteriophages that employed the CRISPR/Cas systems, and compares multiple procedures illustrating common or distinct features as well as advantages and disadvantages underlying each procedure. We design new applications of the CRISPR/Cas systems coupled with bacteriophage recombination systems, discuss their potential constraints, and offer suggestions for each option.

29784811	The CRISPR-Cas systems of bacterial and archaeal adaptive immunity consist of direct repeat arrays separated by unique spacers and multiple CRISPR-associated (cas) genes encoding proteins that mediate all stages of the CRISPR response. In addition to the relatively small set of core cas genes that are typically present in all CRISPR-Cas systems of a given (sub)type and are essential for the defense function, numerous genes occur in CRISPR-cas loci only sporadically. Some of these have been shown to perform various ancillary roles in CRISPR response, but the functional relevance of most remains unknown. We developed a computational strategy for systematically detecting genes that are likely to be functionally linked to CRISPR-Cas. The approach is based on a "CRISPRicity" metric that measures the strength of CRISPR association for all protein-coding genes from sequenced bacterial and archaeal genomes. Uncharacterized genes with CRISPRicity values comparable to those of cas genes are considered candidate CRISPR-linked genes. We describe additional criteria to predict functionally relevance for genes in the candidate set and identify 79 genes as strong candidates for functional association with CRISPR-Cas systems. A substantial majority of these CRISPR-linked genes reside in type III CRISPR-cas loci, which implies exceptional functional versatility of type III systems. Numerous candidate CRISPR-linked genes encode integral membrane proteins suggestive of tight membrane association of CRISPR-Cas systems, whereas many others encode proteins implicated in various signal transduction pathways. These predictions provide ample material for improving annotation of CRISPR-cas loci and experimental characterization of previously unsuspected aspects of CRISPR-Cas system functionality.

29766738	Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), at least including Alzheimer's, Huntington's, and Parkinson's diseases, have become the most dreaded maladies because there are no precise diagnostic tools or definite treatments for these debilitating diseases. The increased prevalence and a substantial impact on the social-economic and medical care of NDs propel governments to develop policies to counteract the impact. Although the etiologies of NDs are still unknown, growing evidence suggests that genetic, cellular, and circuit alternations may cause the generation of abnormal misfolded proteins, which uncontrolledly accumulate to damage and eventually overwhelm the protein-disposal mechanisms of these neurons, leading to a common pathological feature of NDs. If the functions and the connectivity can be restored, alterations and accumulated damages may improve. The gene-editing tools including zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-associated nucleases (CRISPR/CAS) have emerged as a novel tool not only for generating specific ND animal models for interrogating the mechanisms and screening potential drugs against NDs but also for the editing sequence-specific genes to help patients with NDs to regain function and connectivity. This review introduces the clinical manifestations of three distinct NDs and the applications of the gene-editing technology on these debilitating diseases.

29765036	High-throughput CRISPR-Cas9 screens have recently emerged as powerful tools to decipher gene functions and genetic interactions. Here we use a genome-wide library of guide RNAs to direct the catalytically dead Cas9 (dCas9) to block gene transcription in Escherichia coli. Using a machine-learning approach, we reveal that guide RNAs sharing specific 5-nucleotide seed sequences can produce strong fitness defects or even kill E. coli regardless of the other 15 nucleotides of guide sequence. This effect occurs at high dCas9 concentrations and can be alleviated by tuning the expression of dCas9 while maintaining strong on-target repression. Our results also highlight the fact that off-targets with as little as nine nucleotides of homology to the guide RNA can strongly block gene expression. Altogether this study provides important design rules to safely use dCas9 in E. coli.	L Cui|A Vigouroux|F Rousset|H Varet|V Khanna|D Bikard
29765029	CRISPR is becoming an indispensable tool in biological research. Once known as the bacterial immune system against invading viruses, the programmable capacity of the Cas9 enzyme is now revolutionizing diverse fields of medical research, biotechnology, and agriculture. CRISPR-Cas9 is no longer just a gene-editing tool; the application areas of catalytically impaired inactive Cas9, including gene regulation, epigenetic editing, chromatin engineering, and imaging, now exceed the gene-editing functionality of WT Cas9. Here, we will present a brief history of gene-editing tools and describe the wide range of CRISPR-based genome-targeting tools. We will conclude with future directions and the broader impact of CRISPR technologies.	M Adli
29764210	Hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT1) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by deficiency of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH). It has been previously shown that ex vivo hepatocyte-directed gene therapy using an integrating lentiviral vector to replace the defective Fah gene can cure liver disease in small- and large-animal models of HT1. This study hypothesized that ex vivo hepatocyte-directed gene editing using CRISPR/Cas9 could be used to correct a mouse model of HT1, in which a single point mutation results in loss of FAH function. To achieve high transduction efficiencies of primary hepatocytes, this study utilized a lentiviral vector (LV) to deliver both the Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 nuclease and target guide RNA (LV-Cas9) and an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector to deliver a 1.2 kb homology template (AAV-HT). Cells were isolated from Fah-/- mice and cultured in the presence of LV and AAV vectors. Transduction of cells with LV-Cas9 induced significant indels at the target locus, and correction of the point mutation in Fah-/- cells ex vivo using AAV-HT was completely dependent on LV-Cas9. Next, hepatocytes transduced ex vivo by LV-Cas9 and AAV-HT were transplanted into syngeneic Fah-/- mice that had undergone a two-thirds partial hepatectomy or sham hepatectomy. Mice were cycled on/off the protective drug 2-(2-nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl)-1,3-cyclohexanedione (NTBC) to stimulate expansion of corrected cells. All transplanted mice became weight stable off NTBC. However, a significant improvement was observed in weight stability off NTBC in animals that received partial hepatectomy. After 6 months, mice were euthanized, and thorough biochemical and histological examinations were performed. Biochemical markers of liver injury were significantly improved over non-transplanted controls. Histological examination of mice revealed normal tissue architecture, while immunohistochemistry showed robust repopulation of recipient animals with FAH+ cells. In summary, this is the first report of ex vivo hepatocyte-directed gene repair using CRISPR/Cas9 to demonstrate curative therapy in an animal model of liver disease.

29762900	We developed simplified single transcriptional unit (SSTU) CRISPR systems for multiplex gene editing in rice using FnCpf1, LbCpf1 or Cas9, in which the nuclease and its crRNA array are co-expressed from a single Pol II promoter, without any additional processing machinery. Our SSTU systems are easy to construct and effective in mediating multiplex genome editing.	M Wang|Y Mao|Y Lu|Z Wang|X Tao|JK Zhu
29761214	To clarify the resistance mechanisms of Pannonibacter phragmitetus 31801, isolated from the blood of a liver abscess patient, at the genomic level, we performed whole genomic sequencing using a PacBio RS II single-molecule real-time long-read sequencer. Bioinformatic analysis of the resulting sequence was then carried out to identify any possible resistance genes. Analyses included Basic Local Alignment Search Tool searches against the Antibiotic Resistance Genes Database, ResFinder analysis of the genome sequence, and Resistance Gene Identifier analysis within the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database. Prophages, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR), and other putative virulence factors were also identified using PHAST, CRISPRfinder, and the Virulence Factors Database, respectively. The circular chromosome and single plasmid of P. phragmitetus 31801 contained multiple antibiotic resistance genes, including those coding for three different types of β-lactamase [NPS β-lactamase (EC 3.5.2.6), β-lactamase class C, and a metal-dependent hydrolase of β-lactamase superfamily I]. In addition, genes coding for subunits of several multidrug-resistance efflux pumps were identified, including those targeting macrolides (adeJ, cmeB), tetracycline (acrB, adeAB), fluoroquinolones (acrF, ceoB), and aminoglycosides (acrD, amrB, ceoB, mexY, smeB). However, apart from the tripartite macrolide efflux pump macAB-tolC, the genome did not appear to contain the complete complement of subunit genes required for production of most of the major multidrug-resistance efflux pumps.

29760071	PRDM1 is a tumor suppressor that plays an important role in B and T cell lymphomas. Our previous studies demonstrated that PRDM1β is a p53-response gene in human colorectal cancer cells. However, the function of PRDM1β in colorectal cancer cells and colon tumor organoids is not clear. Here we show that PRDM1β is a p53-response gene in human colon organoids and that low PRDM1 expression predicts poor survival in colon cancer patients. We engineered PRDM1 knockouts and overexpression clones in RKO cells and characterized the PRDM1-dependent transcript landscapes, revealing that both the α and β transcript isoforms repress MYC-response genes and stem cell-related genes. Finally, we show that forced expression of PRDM1 in human colon cancer organoids prevents the formation and growth of colon tumor organoids in vitro. These results suggest that p53 may exert tumor-suppressive effects in part through a PRDM1-dependent silencing of stem cell genes, depleting the size of the normal intestinal stem cell compartment in response to DNA damage.

29759937	Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is caused by epigenetic de-repression of the disease locus, leading to pathogenic misexpression of the DUX4 gene in skeletal muscle. While the factors and pathways involved in normal repression of the FSHD locus in healthy cells have been well characterized, very little is known about those responsible for the aberrant activation of DUX4-fl in FSHD myocytes. Reasoning that DUX4-fl activators might represent useful targets for small molecule inhibition, we performed a highly targeted, candidate-based screen of epigenetic regulators in primary FSHD myocytes. We confirmed several of the strongest and most specific candidates (ASH1L, BRD2, KDM4C, and SMARCA5) in skeletal myocytes from two other unrelated FSHD1 patients, and we showed that knockdown led to reduced levels of DUX4-fl and DUX4-FL target genes, as well as altered chromatin at the D4Z4 locus. As a second mode of validation, targeting the CRISPR/dCas9-KRAB transcriptional repressor to the promoters of several candidates also led to reduced levels of DUX4-fl. Furthermore, these candidates can be repressed by different methods in skeletal myocytes without major effects on certain critical muscle genes. Our results demonstrate that expression of DUX4-fl is regulated by multiple epigenetic pathways, and they indicate viable, druggable candidates for therapeutic target development.

29759820	To develop a universal gene therapy to overcome the genetic heterogeneity in retinitis pigmentosa (RP) resulting from mutations in rhodopsin (RHO).	Experimental study for a combination gene therapy that uses both gene ablation and gene replacement.	This study included 2 kinds of human RHO mutation knock-in mouse models: RhoP23H and RhoD190N. In total, 23 RhoP23H/P23H, 43 RhoP23H/+, and 31 RhoD190N/+ mice were used for analysis.	This study involved gene therapy using dual adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) that (1) destroy expression of the endogenous Rho gene in a mutation-independent manner via an improved clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-based gene deletion and (2) enable expression of wild-type protein via exogenous cDNA.	Electroretinographic and histologic analysis.	The thickness of the outer nuclear layer (ONL) after the subretinal injection of combination ablate-and-replace gene therapy was approximately 17% to 36% more than the ONL thickness resulting from gene replacement-only therapy at 3 months after AAV injection. Furthermore, electroretinography results demonstrated that the a and b waves of both RhoP23H and RhoD190N disease models were preserved more significantly using ablate-and-replace gene therapy (P < 0.001), but not by gene replacement monotherapy.	As a proof of concept, our results suggest that the ablate-and-replace strategy can ameliorate disease progression as measured by photoreceptor structure and function for both of the human mutation knock-in models. These results demonstrate the potency of the ablate-and-replace strategy to treat RP caused by different Rho mutations. Furthermore, because ablate-and-replace treatment is mutation independent, this strategy may be used to treat a wide array of dominant diseases in ophthalmology and other fields. Clinical trials using ablate-and-replace gene therapy would allow researchers to determine if this strategy provides any benefits for patients with diseases of interest.

29757291	With an increasing incidence of prostate cancer, identification of new tumor drivers or modulators is crucial. Genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) for prostate cancer are hampered by tumor heterogeneity and its complex microevolution dynamics. Traditional prostate cancer mouse models include, amongst others, germline and conditional knockouts, transgenic expression of oncogenes, and xenograft models. Generation of de novo mutations in these models is complex, time-consuming, and costly. In addition, most of traditional models target the majority of the prostate epithelium, whereas human prostate cancer is well known to evolve as an isolated event in only a small subset of cells. Valuable models need to simulate not only prostate cancer initiation, but also progression to advanced disease. Here we describe a method to target a few cells in the prostate epithelium by transducing cells by viral particles. The delivery of an engineered virus to the murine prostate allows alteration of gene expression in the prostate epithelia. Virus type and quantity will hereby define the number of targeted cells for gene alteration by transducing a few cells for cancer initiation and many cells for gene therapy. Through surgery-based injection in the anterior lobe, distal from the urinary track, the tumor in this model can expand without impairing the urinary function of the animal. Furthermore, by targeting only a subset of prostate epithelial cells the technique enables clonal expansion of the tumor, and therefore mimics human tumor initiation, progression, as well as invasion through the basal membrane. This novel technique provides a powerful prostate cancer model with improved physiological relevance. Animal suffering is limited, and since no additional breeding is required, overall animal count is reduced. At the same time, analysis of new candidate genes and pathways is accelerated, which in turn is more cost efficient.	M Riedel|MF Berthelsen|L Bakiri|EF Wagner|MK Thomsen
29754814	Embryonic cell fates are defined by transcription factors that are rapidly deployed, yet attempts to visualize these factors in vivo often fail because of slow fluorescent protein maturation. Here, we pioneer a protein tag, LlamaTag, which circumvents this maturation limit by binding mature fluorescent proteins, making it possible to visualize transcription factor concentration dynamics in live embryos. Implementing this approach in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, we discovered stochastic bursts in the concentration of transcription factors that are correlated with bursts in transcription. We further used LlamaTags to show that the concentration of protein in a given nucleus heavily depends on transcription of that gene in neighboring nuclei; we speculate that this inter-nuclear signaling is an important mechanism for coordinating gene expression to delineate straight and sharp boundaries of gene expression. Thus, LlamaTags now make it possible to visualize the flow of information along the central dogma in live embryos.	JP Bothma|MR Norstad|S Alamos|HG Garcia
29754775	Development of efficacious in vivo delivery platforms for CRISPR-Cas9-based epigenome engineering will be critical to enable the ability to target human diseases without permanent modification of the genome. Toward this, we utilized split-Cas9 systems to develop a modular adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector platform for CRISPR-Cas9 delivery to enable the full spectrum of targeted in situ gene regulation functionalities, demonstrating robust transcriptional repression (up to 80%) and activation (up to 6-fold) of target genes in cell culture and mice. We also applied our platform for targeted in vivo gene-repression-mediated gene therapy for retinitis pigmentosa. Specifically, we engineered targeted repression of Nrl, a master regulator of rod photoreceptor determination, and demonstrated Nrl knockdown mediates in situ reprogramming of rod cells into cone-like cells that are resistant to retinitis pigmentosa-specific mutations, with concomitant prevention of secondary cone loss. Furthermore, we benchmarked our results from Nrl knockdown with those from in vivo Nrl knockout via gene editing. Taken together, our AAV-CRISPR-Cas9 platform for in vivo epigenome engineering enables a robust approach to target disease in a genomically scarless and potentially reversible manner.

29754247	Plasmids are highly useful tools for studying living cells and for heterologous expression of genes and pathways in cell factories. Standardized tools and operating procedures for handling such DNA vectors are core principles in synthetic biology. Here, we describe protocols for molecular cloning and exchange of genetic parts in the Standard European Vectors Architecture (SEVA) vector system. Additionally, to facilitate rapid testing and iterative bioengineering using different vector designs, we provide a one-step protocol for a universal CRISPR-Cas9-based plasmid curing system (pFREE) and demonstrate the application of this system to cure SEVA constructs (all vectors are available at SEVA/Addgene).

29754237	The discovery and adaptation of RNA-guided nucleases has resulted in the rapid development of efficient, scalable, and easily accessible synthetic biology tools for targeted genome editing and transcriptional control. In these systems, for example CRISPR-Cas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes, a protein with nuclease activity is targeted to a specific nucleotide sequence by a short RNA molecule, whereupon binding it cleaves the targeted nucleotide strand. To extend this genome-editing ability to the industrially important oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica, we developed a set of easily usable and effective CRISPR-Cas9 episomal vectors. In this protocols chapter, we first present a method by which arbitrary protein-coding genes can be disrupted via indel formation after CRISPR-Cas9 targeting. A second method demonstrates how the same CRISPR-Cas9 system can be used to induce markerless gene cassette integration into the genome by inducing homologous recombination after DNA cleavage by Cas9. Finally, we describe how a catalytically inactive form of Cas9 fused to a transcriptional repressor can be used to control transcription of native genes in Y. lipolytica. The CRISPR-Cas9 tools and strategies described here greatly increase the types of genome editing and transcriptional control that can be achieved in Y. lipolytica, and promise to facilitate more advanced engineering of this important oleaginous host.

29754236	CRISPR-Cas9 has been explored as a transformative genome engineering tool for many eukaryotic organisms. However, its utilization in bacteria remains limited and ineffective. This chapter, taking Clostridium beijerinckii as an example, describes the use of Streptococcus pyogenes CRISPR-Cas9 system guided by the single chimeric guide RNA (gRNA) for diverse genome-editing purposes, including chromosomal gene deletion, integration, single nucleotide modification, as well as "clean" mutant selection. The general principle is to use CRISPR-Cas9 as an efficient selection tool for the edited mutant (whose CRISPR-Cas9 target site has been disrupted through a homologous recombination event and thus can survive selection) against? the wild type background cells. This protocol is broadly applicable to other microorganisms for genome-editing purposes.	ZT Zhang|P Jiménez-Bonilla|SO Seo|T Lu|YS Jin|HP Blaschek|Y Wang
29754234	Genome editing using programmable DNA endonucleases enables the engineering of eukaryotic cells and living organisms with desirable properties or traits. Among the various molecular scissors that have been developed to date, the most versatile and easy-to-use family of nucleases derives from CRISPR-Cas, which exists naturally as an adaptive immune system in bacteria. Recent advances in the CRISPR-Cas technology have expanded our ability to manipulate complex genomes for myriad biomedical and biotechnological applications. Some of these applications are time-sensitive or demand high spatial precision. Here, we describe the use of an inducible CRISPR-Cas9 system, termed iCas, which we have developed to enable rapid and tight control of genome editing in mammalian cells. The iCas system can be switched on or off as desired through the introduction or removal of the small molecule tamoxifen or its related analogs such as 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-HT).

29754231	Several CRISPR/Cas9 tools have been recently established for precise genome editing in a wide range of filamentous fungi. This genome editing platform offers high flexibility in target selection and the possibility of introducing genetic deletions without the introduction of transgenic sequences . This chapter describes an approach for the transformation of Penicillium chrysogenum protoplasts with preassembled ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs) consisting of purified Cas9 protein and in vitro transcribed single guide RNA (sgRNA) for the deletion of genome sequences or their replacement with alternative sequences. This method is potentially transferable to all fungal strains where protoplasts can be obtained from.	C Pohl|L Mózsik|AJM Driessen|RAL Bovenberg|YI Nygård
29754227	Recent advances in the CRISPR/Cas9 system have dramatically facilitated genome engineering in various cell systems. Among the protocols, the direct delivery of the Cas9-sgRNA ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex into cells is an efficient approach to increase genome editing efficiency. This method uses purified Cas9 protein and in vitro transcribed sgRNA to edit the target gene without vector DNA. We have applied the RNP complex to CHO cell engineering to obtain desirable phenotypes and to reduce unintended insertional mutagenesis and off-target effects. Here, we describe our routine methods for RNP complex-mediated gene deletion including the protocols to prepare the purified Cas9 protein and the in vitro transcribed sgRNA. Subsequently, we also describe a protocol to confirm the edited genomic positions using the T7E1 enzymatic assay and next-generation sequencing.	J Shin|N Lee|S Cho|BK Cho
29752298	Heterogeneity of cell states represented in pluripotent cultures has not been described at the transcriptional level. Since gene expression is highly heterogeneous between cells, single-cell RNA sequencing can be used to identify how individual pluripotent cells function. Here, we present results from the analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data from 18,787 individual WTC-CRISPRi human induced pluripotent stem cells. We developed an unsupervised clustering method and, through this, identified four subpopulations distinguishable on the basis of their pluripotent state, including a core pluripotent population (48.3%), proliferative (47.8%), early primed for differentiation (2.8%), and late primed for differentiation (1.1%). For each subpopulation, we were able to identify the genes and pathways that define differences in pluripotent cell states. Our method identified four transcriptionally distinct predictor gene sets composed of 165 unique genes that denote the specific pluripotency states; using these sets, we developed a multigenic machine learning prediction method to accurately classify single cells into each of the subpopulations. Compared against a set of established pluripotency markers, our method increases prediction accuracy by 10%, specificity by 20%, and explains a substantially larger proportion of deviance (up to threefold) from the prediction model. Finally, we developed an innovative method to predict cells transitioning between subpopulations and support our conclusions with results from two orthogonal pseudotime trajectory methods.

29752075	The rate of crop improvement must increase to meet rising global demand for food. Crop breeding pipelines can be hampered by the imprecision and multi-generational timeframe of methods such as intercrossing and stochastic mutagenesis used to generate variation. Genome editing can generate targeted allelic series of trait-related genes and regulatory elements, creating a series of variable phenotypes for breeding within a single generation. Disrupting genic and regulatory regions is particularly effective for engineering quantitative traits. Although qualitative traits can be more difficult to engineer using disruption, precise base editing may allow an efficient path to rationally improve qualitative traits if protein function can be accurately modelled. As functional understanding of genes and regulatory elements increases, genome editing can enhance the predictability of plant breeding outcomes and will ensure food security.	A Scheben|D Edwards
29751014	The efficient site-specific DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) created by CRISPR/Cas9 has revolutionized genome engineering and has great potential for editing hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs). However, detailed understanding of the variables that influence choice of DNA-DSB repair (DDR) pathways by HSPC is required for therapeutic levels of editing in these clinically relevant cells. We developed a hematopoietic-reporter system that rapidly quantifies the three major DDR pathways utilized at the individual DSB created by CRISPR/Cas9-NHEJ, MMEJ, and HDR-and show its applicability in evaluating the different DDR outcomes utilized by human hematopoietic cell lines and primary human HSPC.

29748649	CRISPR/Cas9 technology has transformed mouse genome editing with unprecedented precision, efficiency, and ease; however, the current practice of microinjecting CRISPR reagents into pronuclear-stage embryos remains rate-limiting. We thus developed CRISPR ribonucleoprotein (RNP) electroporation of zygotes (CRISPR-EZ), an electroporation-based technology that outperforms pronuclear and cytoplasmic microinjection in efficiency, simplicity, cost, and throughput. In C57BL/6J and C57BL/6N mouse strains, CRISPR-EZ achieves 100% delivery of Cas9/single-guide RNA (sgRNA) RNPs, facilitating indel mutations (insertions or deletions), exon deletions, point mutations, and small insertions. In a side-by-side comparison in the high-throughput KnockOut Mouse Project (KOMP) pipeline, CRISPR-EZ consistently outperformed microinjection. Here, we provide an optimized protocol covering sgRNA synthesis, embryo collection, RNP electroporation, mouse generation, and genotyping strategies. Using CRISPR-EZ, a graduate-level researcher with basic embryo-manipulation skills can obtain genetically modified mice in 6 weeks. Altogether, CRISPR-EZ is a simple, economic, efficient, and high-throughput technology that is potentially applicable to other mammalian species.

29748595	LbCpf1, derived from Lachnospiraceae bacterium ND2006, is a CRISPR RNA-guided endonuclease and holds promise for therapeutic applications. Here we show that LbCpf1 can be used for therapeutic gene editing in a mouse model of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The intravitreal delivery of LbCpf1, targeted to two angiogenesis-associated genes encoding vascular endothelial growth factor A (Vegfa) and hypoxia inducing factor 1a (Hif1a), using adeno-associated virus, led to efficient gene disruption with no apparent off-target effects in the retina and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells. Importantly, LbCpf1 targeted to Vegfa or Hif1a in RPE cells reduced the area of laser-induced choroidal neovascularization as efficiently as aflibercept, an anti-VEGF drug currently used in the clinic, without inducing cone dysfunction. Unlike aflibercept, LbCpf1 targeted to Vegfa or Hif1a achieved a long-term therapeutic effect on CNV, potentially avoiding repetitive injections. Taken together, these results indicate that LbCpf1-mediated in vivo genome editing to ablate pathologic angiogenesis provides an effective strategy for the treatment of AMD and other neovascularization-associated diseases.

29748239	Since the discovery of CRISPR-Cas (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, CRISPR-associated genes) immune systems, astonishing progress has been made on revealing their mechanistic foundations. Due to the immense potential as genome engineering tools, research has mainly focussed on a subset of Cas nucleases that target DNA. In addition, however, distinct types of RNA-targetting CRISPR-Cas systems have been identified.

29746416	Recent concerns regarding the clinical utilization of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) involve uncertainties about the potential detrimental effects that many arise due to unintended genetic changes, as in off-target mutagenesis, during CRISPR genome surgery. This review gives an overview of off-targeting detection methods and CRISPR's place in the clinical setting, specifically in the field of ophthalmology.	As CRISPR utilization in the laboratory setting has increased, knowledge regarding CRISPR mechanisms including its off-target effects has also increased. Although a perfect method for achieving 100% specificity is yet to be determined, the past few years have seen many developments in off-targeting detection and in increasing efficacy of CRISPR tools.	The CRISPR system has high potential to be an invaluable therapeutic tool as it has the ability to modify and repair pathogenic retinal lesions. Although it is not yet a perfect system, with further efforts to improve its specificity and efficacy along with careful screening of off-target mutations, CRISPR-mediated genome surgery potential can become maximized and applied to patients.

29746102	DNA substitutions in RNA can probe the importance of A-form structure, 2'-hydroxyl contacts, and conformational constraints within RNA-guided enzymes. Using this approach, we found that Cas9 biochemical activity tolerated significant substitution with DNA nucleotides in the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat RNA (crRNA). Only minimal RNA content was needed in or near the seed region. Simultaneous substitution at all positions with predicted crRNA-Cas9 2'-hydroxyl contacts had no effect on enzyme activity. The trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) also tolerated >50% substitution with DNA. DNA substitutions in the tracrRNA-pairing region of crRNA consistently enhanced cleavage activity while maintaining or improving target specificity. Together, results point to a prominent role for guide:target A-form-like helical structure and a possible regulatory role for the crRNA-tracrRNA pairing motif. A model chimeric crRNA with high activity did not significantly alter RNP assembly or target binding but did reduce Cas9 ribonucleoprotein stability, suggesting effects through conformation or dynamics. Cas9 directed by chimeric RNA-DNA guides may represent a cost-effective synthetic or molecular biology tool for robust and specific DNA cleavage.	ZJ Kartje|CL Barkau|KJ Rohilla|EA Ageely|KT Gagnon
29745899	Nitrogen-containing-bisphosphonates (N-BPs) are a class of drugs widely prescribed to treat osteoporosis and other bone-related diseases. Although previous studies have established that N-BPs function by inhibiting the mevalonate pathway in osteoclasts, the mechanism by which N-BPs enter the cytosol from the extracellular space to reach their molecular target is not understood. Here, we implemented a CRISPRi-mediated genome-wide screen and identified SLC37A3 (solute carrier family 37 member A3) as a gene required for the action of N-BPs in mammalian cells. We observed that SLC37A3 forms a complex with ATRAID (all-trans retinoic acid-induced differentiation factor), a previously identified genetic target of N-BPs. SLC37A3 and ATRAID localize to lysosomes and are required for releasing N-BP molecules that have trafficked to lysosomes through fluid-phase endocytosis into the cytosol. Our results elucidate the route by which N-BPs are delivered to their molecular target, addressing a key aspect of the mechanism of action of N-BPs that may have significant clinical relevance.

29744888	The European Union (EU) has very strict regulations for genetically modified plants, but gene editing challenges the basis of the legislation. Genome editied plants with no foreign DNA added were according to the Swedish competent authority Jordbruksverket falling outside of the EU definition of genetically modified plants, and should hence not be regulated. This article describes the background to this interpretation and also how plants gene edited using CRISPR-Cas9 (a Brassica deletion mutant) for the first (?) time were grown in a garden, cooked and eaten, and the subsequent media attention. Furthermore, it also adresses the troubles authorities in other European countries have to handle these plants.	S Jansson

29735714	CRISPR-Cas9, which imparts adaptive immunity against foreign genomic invaders in certain prokaryotes, has been repurposed for genome-engineering applications. More recently, another RNA-guided CRISPR endonuclease called Cpf1 (also known as Cas12a) was identified and is also being repurposed. Little is known about the kinetics and mechanism of Cpf1 DNA interaction and how sequence mismatches between the DNA target and guide-RNA influence this interaction. We used single-molecule fluorescence analysis and biochemical assays to characterize DNA interrogation, cleavage, and product release by three Cpf1 orthologs. Our Cpf1 data are consistent with the DNA interrogation mechanism proposed for Cas9. They both bind any DNA in search of protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) sequences, verify the target sequence directionally from the PAM-proximal end, and rapidly reject any targets that lack a PAM or that are poorly matched with the guide-RNA. Unlike Cas9, which requires 9 bp for stable binding and ∼16 bp for cleavage, Cpf1 requires an ∼17-bp sequence match for both stable binding and cleavage. Unlike Cas9, which does not release the DNA cleavage products, Cpf1 rapidly releases the PAM-distal cleavage product, but not the PAM-proximal product. Solution pH, reducing conditions, and 5' guanine in guide-RNA differentially affected different Cpf1 orthologs. Our findings have important implications on Cpf1-based genome engineering and manipulation applications.	D Singh|J Mallon|A Poddar|Y Wang|R Tippana|O Yang|S Bailey|T Ha

29728365	In mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), the expression of provirus and endogenous retroelements is epigenetically repressed. Although many cellular factors involved in retroelement silencing have been identified, the complete molecular mechanism remains elusive. In this study, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR screen to advance our understanding of retroelement silencing in mESCs. The Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV)-based retroviral vector MSCV-GFP, which is repressed by the SETDB1/TRIM28 pathway in mESCs, was used as a reporter provirus, and we identified more than 80 genes involved in this process. In particular, ATF7IP and the BAF complex components are linked with the repression of most of the SETDB1 targets. We characterized two factors, MORC2A and RESF1, of which RESF1 is a novel molecule in retroelement silencing. Although both factors are recruited to repress provirus, their roles in repression are different. MORC2A appears to function dependent on repressive epigenetic modifications, while RESF1 regulates repressive epigenetic modifications associated with SETDB1. Our genome-wide CRISPR screen cataloged genes which function at different levels in silencing of SETDB1-target retroelements and provides a useful resource for further molecular studies.

29726937	The engineering of Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated proteins continues to expand the toolkit available for genome editing, reprogramming gene regulation, genome visualisation and epigenetic studies of living organisms. In this review, the emerging design principles on the use of nuclease-deficient CRISPR-based reprogramming of gene expression will be presented. The review will focus on the designs implemented in yeast both at the level of CRISPR proteins and guide RNA (gRNA), but will lend due credits to the seminal studies performed in other species where relevant. In addition to design principles, this review also highlights applications benefitting from the use of CRISPR-mediated transcriptional regulation and discusses the future directions to further expand the toolkit for nuclease-deficient reprogramming of genomes. As such, this review should be of general interest for experimentalists to get familiarised with the parameters underlying the power of reprogramming genomic functions by use of nuclease-deficient CRISPR technologies.

29723268	Electroporation of zygotes represents a rapid alternative to the elaborate pronuclear injection procedure for CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing in mice. However, current protocols for electroporation either require the investment in specialized electroporators or corrosive pre-treatment of zygotes which compromises embryo viability. Here, we describe an easily adaptable approach for the introduction of specific mutations in C57BL/6 mice by electroporation of intact zygotes using a common electroporator with synthetic CRISPR/Cas9 components and minimal technical requirement. Direct comparison to conventional pronuclear injection demonstrates significantly reduced physical damage and thus improved embryo development with successful genome editing in up to 100% of living offspring. Hence, our novel approach for Easy Electroporation of Zygotes (EEZy) allows highly efficient generation of CRISPR/Cas9 transgenic mice while reducing the numbers of animals required.

29717009	Antibiotic-resistant bacteria are critical public health concerns. Among the prime causative factors for the spread of antibiotic resistance is horizontal gene transfer (HGT). A useful model organism for investigating the relationship between HGT and antibiotic resistance is the opportunistic pathogen Enterococcus faecalis, since the species possesses highly conjugative plasmids that readily disseminate antibiotic resistance genes and virulence factors in nature. Unlike many commensal E. faecalis strains, the genomes of multidrug-resistant (MDR) E. faecalis clinical isolates are enriched for mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and lack clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated protein (Cas) genome defense systems. CRISPR-Cas systems cleave foreign DNA in a programmable, sequence-specific manner and are disadvantageous for MGE-derived genome expansion. An unexplored facet of CRISPR biology in E. faecalis is that MGEs that are targeted by native CRISPR-Cas systems can be maintained transiently. Here, we investigate the basis for this "CRISPR tolerance." We observe that E. faecalis can maintain self-targeting constructs that direct Cas9 to cleave the chromosome, but at a fitness cost. Interestingly, DNA repair genes were not upregulated during self-targeting, but integrated prophages were strongly induced. We determined that low cas9 expression contributes to this transient nonlethality and used this knowledge to develop a robust CRISPR-assisted genome-editing scheme. Our results suggest that E. faecalis has maximized the potential for DNA acquisition by attenuating its CRISPR machinery, thereby facilitating the acquisition of potentially beneficial MGEs that may otherwise be restricted by genome defense.IMPORTANCE CRISPR-Cas has provided a powerful toolkit to manipulate bacteria, resulting in improved genetic manipulations and novel antimicrobials. These powerful applications rely on the premise that CRISPR-Cas chromosome targeting, which leads to double-stranded DNA breaks, is lethal. In this study, we show that chromosomal CRISPR targeting in Enterococcus faecalis is transiently nonlethal. We uncover novel phenotypes associated with this "CRISPR tolerance" and, after determining its genetic basis, develop a genome-editing platform in E. faecalis with negligible off-target effects. Our findings reveal a novel strategy exploited by a bacterial pathogen to cope with CRISPR-induced conflicts to more readily accept DNA, and our robust CRISPR editing platform will help simplify genetic modifications in this organism.

29712754	Pooled CRISPR screens based on lentiviral systems have been widely applied to identify the effect of gene knockout on cellular phenotype. Although many screens were successful, they also have the limitation that genes conferring mild phenotypes or those essential for growth can be overlooked, as every genetic perturbation is incorporated in the same population. Arrayed screens, on the other hand, incorporate a single genetic perturbation in each well and could overcome these limitations. However, arrayed screens based on siRNA-mediated knockdown were recently criticized for low reproducibility caused by incomplete inhibition of gene expression. To overcome these limitations, we developed a novel arrayed CRISPR screen based on a plasmid library expressing a single guide RNA (sgRNA) and disrupted 1514 genes, encoding kinases, proteins related to endocytosis, and Golgi-localized proteins, individually using 4542 sgRNAs (three sgRNAs per gene). This screen revealed host factors required for infection by coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) from Picornaviridae, which includes human pathogens causing diverse diseases. Many host factors that had been overlooked in a conventional pooled screen were identified for CVB3 infection, including entry-related factors, translational initiation factors, and several replication factors with different functions, demonstrating the advantage of the arrayed screen. This screen was quite reliable and reproducible, as most genes identified in the primary screen were confirmed in secondary screens. Moreover, ACBD3, whose phenotype was not affected by siRNA-mediated knockdown, was reliably identified. We propose that arrayed CRISPR screens based on sgRNA plasmid libraries are powerful tools for arrayed genetic screening and applicable to larger-scale screens.

29709259	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) screening is a powerful toolset for investigating diverse biological processes. Most CRISPR screens to date have been performed with in vitro cultures or cellular transplant models. To interrogate cancer in animal models that more closely recapitulate the human disease, autochthonous direct in vivo CRISPR screens have recently been developed that can identify causative drivers in the native tissue microenvironment. By empowering multiplexed mutagenesis in fully immunocompetent animals, direct in vivo CRISPR screens enable the rapid generation of patient-specific avatars that can guide precision medicine. This Opinion article discusses the current status of in vivo CRISPR screens in cancer and offers perspectives on future applications.	RD Chow|S Chen
29706536	CRISPR-Cas provides RNA-guided adaptive immunity against invading genetic elements. Interference in type I systems relies on the RNA-guided Cascade complex for target DNA recognition and the Cas3 helicase/nuclease protein for target degradation. Even though the biochemistry of CRISPR interference has been largely covered, the biophysics of DNA unwinding and coupling of the helicase and nuclease domains of Cas3 remains elusive. Here, we employed single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) to probe the helicase activity with high spatiotemporal resolution. We show that Cas3 remains tightly associated with the target-bound Cascade complex while reeling the DNA using a spring-loaded mechanism. This spring-loaded reeling occurs in distinct bursts of 3 bp, which underlie three successive 1-nt unwinding events. Reeling is highly repetitive, allowing Cas3 to repeatedly present its inefficient nuclease domain with single-strand DNA (ssDNA) substrate. Our study reveals that the discontinuous helicase properties of Cas3 and its tight interaction with Cascade ensure controlled degradation of target DNA only.	L Loeff|SJJ Brouns|C Joo
29706504	Chlamydia trachomatis (Ctr) accounts for >130 million human infections annually. Since chronic Ctr infections are extremely difficult to treat, there is an urgent need for more effective therapeutics. As an obligate intracellular bacterium, Ctr strictly depends on the functional contribution of the host cell. Here, we combined a human genome-wide RNA interference screen with metabolic profiling to obtain detailed understanding of changes in the infected cell and identify druggable pathways essential for Ctr growth. We demonstrate that Ctr shifts the host metabolism toward aerobic glycolysis, consistent with increased biomass requirement. We identify key regulator complexes of glucose and nucleotide metabolism that govern Ctr infection processes. Pharmacological targeting of inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), the rate-limiting enzyme in guanine nucleotide biosynthesis, efficiently inhibits Ctr growth both in vitro and in vivo. These results highlight the potency of genome-scale functional screening for the discovery of drug targets against bacterial infections.

29704438	Combinatorial metabolic engineering enabled the development of efficient microbial cell factories for modulating gene expression to produce desired products. Here, we report the combinatorial metabolic engineering of Corynebacterium glutamicum to produce butyrate by introducing a synthetic butyrate pathway including phosphotransferase and butyrate kinase reactions and repressing the essential acn gene-encoding aconitase, which has been targeted for downregulation in a genome-scale model. An all-in-one clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats interference system for C. glutamicum was used for tunable downregulation of acn in an engineered strain, where by-product-forming reactions were deleted and the synthetic butyrate pathway was inserted, resulting in butyrate production (0.52 ± 0.02 g/L). Subsequently, biotin limitation enabled the engineered strain to produce butyrate (0.58 ± 0.01 g/L) without acetate formation for the entire duration of the culture. These results demonstrate the potential homo-production of butyrate using engineered C. glutamicum. This method can also be applied to other industrial microorganisms.	J Yoon|HM Woo

29700067	The advent of high-throughput epigenome mapping technologies has ushered in a new era of multiomics where powerful tools can now delineate and record different layers of genomic output. Integrating various components of the epigenome from these multiomics measurements allows the interrogation of cellular heterogeneity in addition to the discovery of molecular connectivity maps between the genome and its functional output. Mapping of chromatin accessibility dynamics and higher-order chromatin structure has enabled new levels of understanding of cell fate decisions, identity, and function in normal development, physiology, and disease. We provide a perspective on the progress of the epigenomics field and applications and anticipate an even greater revolution in our understanding of the human epigenome for years to come.

29700043	Regular blood transfusion is the cornerstone of care for patients with red blood cell (RBC) disorders such as thalassaemia or sickle-cell disease. With repeated transfusion, alloimmunisation often occurs due to incompatibility at the level of minor blood group antigens. We use CRISPR-mediated genome editing of an immortalised human erythroblast cell line (BEL-A) to generate multiple enucleation competent cell lines deficient in individual blood groups. Edits are combined to generate a single cell line deficient in multiple antigens responsible for the most common transfusion incompatibilities: ABO (Bombay phenotype), Rh (Rhnull), Kell (K0), Duffy (Fynull), GPB (S-s-U-). These cells can be differentiated to generate deformable reticulocytes, illustrating the capacity for coexistence of multiple rare blood group antigen null phenotypes. This study provides the first proof-of-principle demonstration of combinatorial CRISPR-mediated blood group gene editing to generate customisable or multi-compatible RBCs for diagnostic reagents or recipients with complicated matching requirements.

29695804	CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing is a transformative technology that will facilitate the development of crops to meet future demands. However, application of gene editing is hindered by the long life cycle of many crop species and because desired genotypes generally require multiple generations to achieve. Single-celled microspores are haploid cells that can develop into double haploid plants and have been widely used as a breeding tool to generate homozygous plants within a generation. In this study, we combined the CRISPR/Cas9 system with microspore technology and developed an optimized haploid mutagenesis system to induce genetic modifications in the wheat genome. We investigated a number of factors that may affect the delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 reagents into microspores and found that electroporation of a minimum of 75,000 cells using 10-20 µg DNA and a pulsing voltage of 500 V is optimal for microspore transfection using the Neon transfection system. Using multiple Cas9 and sgRNA constructs, we present evidence for the seamless introduction of targeted modifications in an exogenous DsRed gene and two endogenous wheat genes, including TaLox2 and TaUbiL1. This study demonstrates the value and feasibility of combining microspore technology and CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing for trait discovery and improvement in plants.

29695626	The biological function of a gene is often probed through its interactions with other genes. This general approach has been especially useful to build knowledge about poorly understood genes upon the bedrock of well-characterized genes. Genetic interaction analysis requires the construction of strains with mutations in two or more genes. Single-gene mutants of microbial pathogens are generally validated through introduction of a wild-type copy of the affected gene to create a complemented or reconstituted strain, followed by testing for restoration of a wild-type phenotype. This practice, formalized as one of Falkow's "molecular Koch's postulates" ensures that the phenotype of the mutant depends upon the known mutation. However, multigene mutants are seldom validated because of the labor required to assemble multiple genomic segments into a vector that can be introduced into the mutant strain. We present here an approach, concatemer assembly for rescue of mutant abilities (CARMA), that circumvents this impediment through an in vivo recombinational assembly strategy that does not require cloning at all. Our results show that CARMA allows genetic rescue of two double-gene mutant strains of the fungal pathogen Candida albicansIMPORTANCE Our understanding of new genes is often built upon the knowledge of well-characterized genes. One avenue toward revealing such connections involves creation of strains with mutations in two or more defined genes to permit genetic interaction analysis. Strain manipulations can yield unexpected mutations at loci outside the defined targeted genes. In this report, we describe a method for rapid validation of multigene mutants, thus allowing an appraisal of the contribution of the defined targeted genes to the strain's phenotype.

29690746	Gene engineering has attracted worldwide attention because of its ability of precise location of disease mutations in genome. As a new gene editing technology, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated 9 (Cas9) system is simple, fast, and accurate to operate at a specific gene site. It overcomes the long-standing problem of conventional operation. At the same time, stem cells are a good foundation for establishing disease model in vitro. Therefore, it has great significance to combine stem cells with the rapidly developing gene manipulation techniques. In this review, we mainly focus on the mechanism of CRISPR/Cas9 technology and its application in stem cell genomic editing, so as to pave the way for promoting rapid application and development of CRISPR/Cas9 technology.

29688335	Ogataea thermomethanolica TBRC656 is a thermotolerant methylotrophic yeast suitable for heterologous protein expression at various temperatures. However, the lack of efficient methods for targeted gene mutagenesis limits strain engineering in this yeast. In this study, we applied a CRISPR-Cas9-based tool for targeted gene mutagenesis in O. thermomethanolica. The putative unfolded protein response regulator OtHAC1, and the OtMAL1 (maltase) and OtMAL2 (maltose permease) genes involved with sucrose and maltose utilization were targeted for CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis. Plasmids were constructed for integrative and episomal expression of CRISPR-Cas9 elements in O. thermomethanolica in which Cas9 and gRNA are transcribed from the alcohol oxidase (AOX) promoter. The expression of these genome-editing elements is controlled by derepression with glycerol and gRNA are flanked by self-cleaving ribozymes. For integrative system, OtHAC1, OtMAL1 and OtMAL2 were disrupted at 63%, 97% and 93%, respectively. In addition, OtMAL1 was also disrupted with episomal system at 92%. These findings indicate that the CRISPR-Cas9 system described herein is thus applicable for studying gene function and strain engineering in yeast O. thermomethanolica.

29685355	RNA-guided genome engineering technologies have been developed for the advanced metabolic engineering of microbial cells to enhance production of value-added chemicals in Corynebacterium glutamicum as an industrial host. In this study, the RNA-guided CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) was applied to rapidly identify of unknown genes for native esterase activity in C. glutamicum. Combining with the carboxyl esterase (MekB) protein sequence alignment, two target genes (the cg0961 and cg0754) were selected for the CRISPRi application to investigate the possible native esterase in C. glutamicum. The recombinant strain with repressed expression of the cg0961 gene exhibited almost no capability on degradation of methyl acetate as a substrate of carboxyl esterase. This result was also confirmed in the cg0961 gene deletion mutant. Thus, we concluded that Cg0961 plays a major role of the native carboxyl esterase activity in C. glutamicum. In addition, CRISPRi demonstrated an application for gene identification and its function as another genetic tool for metabolic engineering in C. glutamicum.	SS Lee|H Shin|S Jo|SM Lee|Y Um|HM Woo
29684735	Viruses impose an immense burden on human health. With the goal of treating and preventing viral infections, researchers have carried out genetic screens to improve our understanding of viral dependencies and identify potential anti-viral strategies. The emergence of CRISPR genetic screening tools has facilitated this effort by enabling host-virus screens to be undertaken in a more versatile and fidelitous manner than previously possible. Here we review the growing number of CRISPR screens which continue to increase our understanding of host-virus interactions.	WM McDougall|JM Perreira|EC Reynolds|AL Brass
29672586	Adrenergic α2C receptor (ADRA2C) is an inhibitory modulator of the sympathetic nervous system. Knockout mice for this gene show physiological and behavioural alterations that are associated with the fight-or-flight response. There is evidence of positive selection on the regulation of this gene during chicken domestication. Here, we find that the neuronal expression of ADRA2C is lower in human and chimpanzee than in other primates. On the basis of three-dimensional chromatin structure, we identified a cis-regulatory region whose DNA sequences have been significantly accelerated in human and chimpanzee. Active histone modification marks this region in rhesus macaque but not in human and chimpanzee; instead, repressive marks are enriched in various human brain samples. This region contains two neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NRSF) binding motifs, each of which harbours a polymorphism. Our genotyping and analysis of population genome data indicate that at both polymorphic sites, the derived allele has reached fixation in humans and chimpanzees but not in bonobos, whereas only the ancestral allele is present among macaques. Our CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing and reporter assays show that both derived nucleotides repress ADRA2C, most likely by increasing NRSF binding. In addition, we detected signatures of recent positive selection for lower neuronal ADRA2C expression in humans. Our findings indicate that there has been selective pressure for enhanced sympathetic nervous activity in the evolution of humans and chimpanzees.

29669385	High-density lipoprotein (HDL) has been epidemiologically shown to be associated with the outcome of sepsis. One potential mechanism is that HDL possesses pleiotropic effects, such as anti-apoptosis, some of which can be ascribed to sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) carried on HDL via apolipoprotein M (apoM). Therefore, the aim of this study was to elucidate the roles of apoM/S1P in the consequent lethal conditions of sepsis, such as multiple organ failure caused by severe inflammation and/or disseminated intravascular coagulation.	In mice treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), both plasma apoM levels and the expression of apoM in the liver and kidney were suppressed. The overexpression of apoM improved the survival rate and ameliorated the elevated plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatinine levels, while the knockout or knockdown of apoM deteriorated these parameters in mice treated with LPS. Treatment with VPC23019, an antagonist against S1P receptor 1 and 3, or LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, partially reversed these protective properties arising from the overexpression of apoM. The overexpression of apoM inhibited the elevation of plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, restored the phosphorylation of Akt, and induced anti-apoptotic changes in the liver, kidney and heart.	These results suggest that apoM possesses protective properties against LPS-induced organ injuries and could potentially be introduced as a novel therapy for the severe conditions that are consequent to sepsis.

29662178	The maintenance of pluripotency requires coordinated expression of a set of essential genes. Using our recently established haploid human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), we generated a genome-wide loss-of-function library targeting 18,166 protein-coding genes to define the essential genes in hPSCs. With this we could allude to an intrinsic bias of essentiality across cellular compartments, uncover two opposing roles for tumour suppressor genes and link autosomal-recessive disorders with growth-retardation phenotypes to early embryogenesis. hPSC-enriched essential genes mainly encode transcription factors and proteins related to cell-cycle and DNA-repair, revealing that a quarter of the nuclear factors are essential for normal growth. Our screen also led to the identification of growth-restricting genes whose loss of function provides a growth advantage to hPSCs, highlighting the role of the P53-mTOR pathway in this context. Overall, we have constructed an atlas of essential and growth-restricting genes in hPSCs, revealing key aspects of cellular essentiality and providing a reference for future studies on human pluripotency.

29659822	Genomic editing to correct disease-causing mutations is a promising approach for the treatment of human diseases. As a simple and programmable nuclease-based genomic editing tool, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) system has substantially improved the ability to make precise changes in the human genome. Rapid development of CRISPR-based technologies in recent years has expanded its application scope and promoted CRISPR-based therapies in preclinical trails. Here, we review the application of the CRISPR system over the last 2 years; including its development and application in base editing, transcription modulation and epigenetic editing, genomic-scale screening, and cell and embryo therapy. Finally, the prospects and challenges related to application of CRISPR/Cas9 technologies are discussed.	C Zhang|R Quan|J Wang
29654299	Off-target DNA cleavage is a paramount concern when applying CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technology to functional genetics and human therapeutic applications. Here, we show that incorporation of next-generation bridged nucleic acids (2',4'-BNANC[N-Me]) as well as locked nucleic acids (LNA) at specific locations in CRISPR-RNAs (crRNAs) broadly reduces off-target DNA cleavage by Cas9 in vitro and in cells by several orders of magnitude. Using single-molecule FRET experiments we show that BNANC incorporation slows Cas9 kinetics and improves specificity by inducing a highly dynamic crRNA-DNA duplex for off-target sequences, which shortens dwell time in the cleavage-competent, "zipped" conformation. In addition to describing a robust technique for improving the precision of CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing, this study illuminates an application of synthetic nucleic acids.

29651054	CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) genome-editing experiments offer enormous potential for the evaluation of genomic loci using arrayed single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) or pooled sgRNA libraries. Numerous computational tools are available to help design sgRNAs with optimal on-target efficiency and minimal off-target potential. In addition, computational tools have been developed to analyze deep-sequencing data resulting from genome-editing experiments. However, these tools are typically developed in isolation and oftentimes are not readily translatable into laboratory-based experiments. Here, we present a protocol that describes in detail both the computational and benchtop implementation of an arrayed and/or pooled CRISPR genome-editing experiment. This protocol provides instructions for sgRNA design with CRISPOR (computational tool for the design, evaluation, and cloning of sgRNA sequences), experimental implementation, and analysis of the resulting high-throughput sequencing data with CRISPResso (computational tool for analysis of genome-editing outcomes from deep-sequencing data). This protocol allows for design and execution of arrayed and pooled CRISPR experiments in 4-5 weeks by non-experts, as well as computational data analysis that can be performed in 1-2 d by both computational and noncomputational biologists alike using web-based and/or command-line versions.

29650467	CRISPR-based gene editing is a powerful technology for engineering mammalian genomes. It holds the potential as a therapeutic, although much-needed in vivo delivery systems have yet to be established. Here, using the Cpf1-crRNA (CRISPR RNA) crystal structure as a guide, we synthesized a series of systematically truncated and chemically modified crRNAs, and identify positions that are amenable to modification while retaining gene-editing activity. Modified crRNAs were designed with the same modifications that provide protection against nucleases and enable wide distribution in vivo. We show crRNAs with chemically modified terminal nucleotides are exonuclease resistant while retaining gene-editing activity. Chemically modified or DNA-substituted nucleotides at select positions and up to 70% of the crRNA DNA specificity region are also well tolerated. In addition, gene-editing activity is maintained with phosphorothioate backbone substitutions in the crRNA DNA specificity region. Finally, we demonstrate that 42-mer synthetic crRNAs from the similar CRISPR-Cas9 system are taken up by cells, an attractive property for in vivo delivery. Our study is the first to show that chemically modified crRNAs of the CRISPR-Cpf1 system can functionally replace and mediate comparable gene editing to the natural crRNA, which holds the potential for enhancing both viral- and non-viral-mediated in vivo gene editing.

29650149	A major research topic nowadays is to study and understand the functions of the increasing number of predicted genes that have been discovered through the complete genome sequencing of many plant species. With the aim of developing tools for rapid and convenient gene function analysis, we have developed a set of "pGate" vectors based on the principle of Golden gate and Gateway cloning approaches. These vectors combine the positive aspects of both Golden gate and Gateway cloning strategies. pGate vectors can not only be used as Golden gate recipient vectors to assemble multiple DNA fragments in a pre-defined order, but they can also work as an entry vector to transfer the assembled DNA fragment(s) to a large number of already-existing, functionally diverse, Gateway compatible destination vectors without adding additional nucleotides during cloning. We show the pGate vectors are effective and convenient in several major aspects of gene function analyses, including BiFC (Bimolecular fluorescence complementation) to analyze protein-protein interaction, amiRNA (artificial microRNA) candidate screening and as assembly of CRISPR/Cas9 (Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, CRISPR-associated protein-9 nuclease) system elements together for genome editing. The pGate system is a practical and flexible tool which can facilitate plant gene function research.	Y Luo|Y Qiu|R Na|F Meerja|QS Lu|C Yang|L Tian
29641941	Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a kind of acquired disease that breaks down the immune system. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the causative agent of AIDS. By the end of 2016, there were 36.7 million people living with HIV worldwide. Early diagnosis can alert infected individuals to risk behaviors in order to control HIV transmission. Infected individuals are also benefited from proper treatment and management upon early diagnosis. Thanks to the public awareness of the disease, the annual increase of new HIV infections has been slowly declining over the past decades. The advent of molecular diagnostics has allowed early detection and better management of HIV infected patients. Areas covered: In this review, the authors summarized and discussed the current and future technologies in molecular diagnosis as well as the biomarkers developed for HIV infection. Expert Commentary: A simple and rapid detection of viral load is important for patients and doctors to monitor HIV progression and antiretroviral treatment efficiency. In the near future, it is expected that new technologies such as digital PCR and CRISPR-based technology will play more important role in HIV detection and patient management.

29622802	Cpf1, a CRISPR endonuclease discovered in Prevotella and Francisella 1 bacteria, offers an alternative platform for CRISPR-based genome editing beyond the commonly used CRISPR-Cas9 system originally discovered in Streptococcus pyogenes. This protocol enables the design of engineered CRISPR-Cpf1 components, both CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) to guide the endonuclease and Cpf1 mRNAs to express the endonuclease protein, and provides experimental procedures for effective genome editing using this system. We also describe quantification of genome-editing activity and off-target effects of the engineered CRISPR-Cpf1 in human cell lines using both T7 endonuclease I (T7E1) assay and targeted deep sequencing. This protocol enables rapid construction and identification of engineered crRNAs and Cpf1 mRNAs to enhance genome-editing efficiency using the CRISPR-Cpf1 system, as well as assessment of target specificity within 2 months. This protocol may also be appropriate for fine-tuning other types of CRISPR systems.	B Li|C Zeng|Y Dong
29622782	The CRISPR/Cas9 system is widely applied in genome engineering due to its simplicity and versatility. Although this has revolutionized genome-editing technology, knockin animal generation via homology directed repair (HDR) is not as efficient as nonhomologous end-joining DNA-repair-dependent knockout. Although its double-strand break activity may vary, Cas9 derived from Streptococcus pyogenens allows robust design of single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) within the target sequence; However, prescreening for different sgRNA activities delays the process of transgenic animal generation. To overcome this limitation, multiple sets of different sgRNAs were examined for their knockin efficiency. We discovered profound advantages associated with single-stranded oligo-donor-mediated HDR processes using overlapping sgRNAs (sharing at least five base pairs of the target sites) as compared with using non-overlapping sgRNAs for knock-in mouse generation. Studies utilizing cell lines revealed shorter sequence deletions near target mutations using overlapping sgRNAs as compared with those observed using non-overlapping sgRNAs, which may favor the HDR process. Using this simple method, we successfully generated several transgenic mouse lines harboring loxP insertions or single-nucleotide substitutions with a highly efficiency of 18-38%. Our results demonstrate a simple and efficient method for generating transgenic animals harboring foreign-sequence knockins or short-nucleotide substitutions by the use of overlapping sgRNAs.

29622042	Klebsiella pneumoniae is a promising industrial species for bioproduction of bulk chemicals such as 1,3-propanediol, 2,3-butanediol and 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP). However, lactic acid is a troublesome by-product when optimizing for 3-HP production. Therefore, it is highly desirable to minimize lactic acid.	Here, we show that lactic acid synthesis can be largely blocked by an engineered CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) system in K. pneumoniae. EGFP was recruited as a reporter of this CRISPRi system. Fluorescence assay of this CRISPRi system showed that enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expression level was repressed by 85-90%. To further test this CRISPRi system, guide RNAs were designed to individually or simultaneously target four lactate-producing enzyme genes. Results showed that all lactate-producing enzyme genes were significantly repressed. Notably, D-lactate dehydrogenase (ldhA) was shown to be the most influential enzyme for lactic acid formation in micro-aerobic conditions, as inhibiting ldhA alone led to lactic acid level similar to simultaneously repressing four genes. In shake flask cultivation, the strain coexpressing puuC (an aldehyde dehydrogenase catalyzing 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde to 3-HP) and dCas9-sgRNA inhibiting ldhA produced 1.37-fold 3-HP relative to the reference strain. Furthermore, in bioreactor cultivation, this CRISPRi strain inhibiting ldhA produced 36.7 g/L 3-HP, but only generated 1 g/L lactic acid. Clearly, this engineered CRISPRi system largely simplified downstream separation of 3-HP from its isomer lactic acid, an extreme challenge for 3-HP bioprocess.	This study offers a deep understanding of lactic acid metabolism in diverse species, and we believe that this CRISPRi system will facilitate biomanufacturing and functional genome studies of K. pneumoniae or beyond.

29621180	The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated (CRISPR/Cas) adaptive immune system has been extensively used for gene editing, including gene deletion, insertion, and replacement in bacterial and eukaryotic cells owing to its simple, rapid, and efficient activities in unprecedented resolution. Furthermore, the CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) system including deactivated Cas9 (dCas9) with inactivated endonuclease activity has been further investigated for regulation of the target gene transiently or constitutively, avoiding cell death by disruption of genome. This review discusses the applications of CRISPR/Cas for genome editing in various bacterial systems and their applications. In particular, CRISPR technology has been used for the production of metabolites of high industrial significance, including biochemical, biofuel, and pharmaceutical products/precursors in bacteria. Here, we focus on methods to increase the productivity and yield/titer scan by controlling metabolic flux through individual or combinatorial use of CRISPR/Cas and CRISPRi systems with introduction of synthetic pathway in industrially common bacteria including Escherichia coli. Further, we discuss additional useful applications of the CRISPR/Cas system, including its use in functional genomics.	S Cho|J Shin|BK Cho
29618502	We evaluated the diversity of group B Streptococcus (GBS) vaginal carriage populations in pregnant women. For this purpose, we studied each isolate present in a primary culture of a vaginal swab using a new approach based on clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) locus analysis. To evaluate the CRISPR array composition rapidly, a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis was performed. For each different pattern observed, the CRISPR array was sequenced and capsular typing and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) were performed. A total of 970 isolates from 10 women were analyzed by CRISPR-RFLP. Each woman carrying GBS isolates presented one to five specific "personal" patterns. Five women showed similar isolates with specific and unique restriction patterns, suggesting the carriage of a single GBS clone. Different patterns were observed among isolates from the other five women. For three of these, CRISPR locus sequencing highlighted low levels of internal modifications in the locus backbone, whereas there were high levels of modifications for the last two women, suggesting the carriage of two different clones. These two clones were closely related, having the same ancestral spacer(s), the same capsular type and, in one case, the same ST, but showed different antibiotic resistance patterns in pairs. Eight of 10 women were colonized by a single GBS clone, while two of them were colonized by two strains, leading to a risk of selection of more-virulent and/or more-resistant clones during antibiotic prophylaxis. This CRISPR analysis made it possible to separate isolates belonging to a single capsular type and sequence type, highlighting the greater discriminating power of this approach.

29615501	Blastomyces dermatitidis is a human fungal pathogen of the lung that can lead to disseminated disease in healthy and immunocompromised individuals. Genetic analysis of this fungus is hampered by the relative inefficiency of traditional recombination-based gene-targeting approaches. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of applying CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing to Blastomyces, including to simultaneously target multiple genes. We created targeting plasmid vectors expressing Cas9 and either one or two single guide RNAs and introduced these plasmids into Blastomyces via Agrobacterium gene transfer. We succeeded in disrupting several fungal genes, including PRA1 and ZRT1, which are involved in scavenging and uptake of zinc from the extracellular environment. Single-gene-targeting efficiencies varied by locus (median, 60% across four loci) but were approximately 100-fold greater than traditional methods of Blastomyces gene disruption. Simultaneous dual-gene targeting proceeded with efficiencies similar to those of single-gene-targeting frequencies for the respective targets. CRISPR/Cas9 disruption of PRA1 or ZRT1 had a variable impact on growth under zinc-limiting conditions, showing reduced growth at early time points in low-passage-number cultures and growth similar to wild-type levels by later passage. Individual impairment of PRA1 or ZRT1 resulted in a reduction of the fungal burden in a mouse model of Blastomyces infection by a factor of ~1 log (range, up to 3 logs), and combined disruption of both genes had no additional impact on the fungal burden. These results underscore the utility of CRISPR/Cas9 for efficient gene disruption in dimorphic fungi and reveal a role for zinc metabolism in Blastomyces fitness in vivoIMPORTANCEBlastomyces is a human fungal pathogen that can cause serious, even fatal, lung infections. Genetic analysis of this fungus is possible but inefficient. We applied a recently developed gene editing technology, CRISPR/Cas9, to dramatically improve the efficiency with which gene disruptions are introduced into Blastomyces We used this system to disrupt genes involved in zinc uptake and found that this reduced the fitness of the fungus upon infection.

29608282	Engineering the bacteria present in animal microbiomes promises to lead to breakthroughs in medicine and agriculture, but progress is hampered by a dearth of tools for genetically modifying the diverse species that comprise these communities. Here we present a toolkit of genetic parts for the modular construction of broad-host-range plasmids built around the RSF1010 replicon. Golden Gate assembly of parts in this toolkit can be used to rapidly test various antibiotic resistance markers, promoters, fluorescent reporters, and other coding sequences in newly isolated bacteria. We demonstrate the utility of this toolkit in multiple species of Proteobacteria that are native to the gut microbiomes of honey bees (Apis mellifera) and bumble bees (B ombus sp.). Expressing fluorescent proteins in Snodgrassella alvi, Gilliamella apicola, Bartonella apis, and Serratia strains enables us to visualize how these bacteria colonize the bee gut. We also demonstrate CRISPRi repression in B. apis and use Cas9-facilitated knockout of an S. alvi adhesion gene to show that it is important for colonization of the gut. Beyond characterizing how the gut microbiome influences the health of these prominent pollinators, this bee microbiome toolkit (BTK) will be useful for engineering bacteria found in other natural microbial communities.

29606501	CRISPR is a nuclease guidance system that enables rapid and efficient gene editing of specific DNA sequences within genomes. We review applications of CRISPR for the study and treatment of kidney disease. CRISPR enables functional experiments in cell lines and model organisms to validate candidate genes arising from genetic studies. CRISPR has furthermore been used to establish the first models of genetic disease in human kidney organoids derived from pluripotent stem cells. These gene-edited organoids are providing new insight into the cellular mechanisms of polycystic kidney disease and nephrotic syndrome. CRISPR-engineered cell therapies are currently in clinical trials for cancers and immunologic syndromes, an approach that may be applicable to inflammatory conditions such as lupus nephritis. Use of CRISPR in large domestic species such as pigs raises the possibility of farming kidneys for transplantation to alleviate the shortage of donor organs. However, significant challenges remain, including how to effectively deliver CRISPR to kidneys and how to control gene editing events within the genome. Thorough testing of CRISPR in preclinical models will be critical to the safe and efficacious translation of this powerful young technology into therapies.	NM Cruz|BS Freedman
29606353	Fetal hemoglobin (HbF, α2γ2) level is genetically controlled and modifies severity of adult hemoglobin (HbA, α2β2) disorders, sickle cell disease, and β-thalassemia. Common genetic variation affects expression of BCL11A, a regulator of HbF silencing. To uncover how BCL11A supports the developmental switch from γ- to β- globin, we use a functional assay and protein binding microarray to establish a requirement for a zinc-finger cluster in BCL11A in repression and identify a preferred DNA recognition sequence. This motif appears in embryonic and fetal-expressed globin promoters and is duplicated in γ-globin promoters. The more distal of the duplicated motifs is mutated in individuals with hereditary persistence of HbF. Using the CUT&RUN approach to map protein binding sites in erythroid cells, we demonstrate BCL11A occupancy preferentially at the distal motif, which can be disrupted by editing the promoter. Our findings reveal that direct γ-globin gene promoter repression by BCL11A underlies hemoglobin switching.

29605720	BRAF is the most frequently mutated gene in melanoma. Constitutive activation of mutant BRAFV600E leads to aberrant Ras-independent MAPK signaling and cell transformation. Inhibition of mutant BRAF is a current frontline therapy for such cases, with improved survival compared with chemotherapy. Unfortunately, reactivation of MAPK signaling by several mechanisms has been shown to cause drug resistance and disease recurrence. In this work, we describe the co-occurrence of an in-frame deletion within an amplified BRAFV600E locus and a missense point mutation of the transcriptional repressor BCORL1 in vemurafenib-resistant A375 melanoma cells. Functional data confirmed that truncated p47BRAFV600E and mutant BCORL1Q1076H both contribute to resistance. Interestingly, either endogenous BCORL1 silencing or ectopic BCORL1Q1076H expression mimicked the effects of a CRISPR/Cas9-edited BCORL1Q1076H locus, suggesting a complex mixture of loss- and gain-of-function effects caused by the mutation. Transcriptomic data confirmed this hypothesis. Finally, we show that the pan-RAF inhibitor sorafenib is not affected by expression of BRAF deletion variant and effectively synergizes with vemurafenib to block resistant cells, suggesting a possible intervention for this class of mutants.

29605708	Gene editing can be used to overcome allo-recognition, which otherwise limits allogeneic T cell therapies. Initial proof-of-concept applications have included generation of such "universal" T cells expressing chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) against CD19 target antigens combined with transient expression of DNA-targeting nucleases to disrupt the T cell receptor alpha constant chain (TRAC). Although relatively efficient, transgene expression and editing effects were unlinked, yields variable, and resulting T cell populations heterogeneous, complicating dosing strategies. We describe a self-inactivating lentiviral "terminal" vector platform coupling CAR expression with CRISPR/Cas9 effects through incorporation of an sgRNA element into the ΔU3 3' long terminal repeat (LTR). Following reverse transcription and duplication of the hybrid ΔU3-sgRNA, delivery of Cas9 mRNA resulted in targeted TRAC locus cleavage and allowed the enrichment of highly homogeneous (>96%) CAR+ (>99%) TCR- populations by automated magnetic separation. Molecular analyses, including NGS, WGS, and Digenome-seq, verified on-target specificity with no evidence of predicted off-target events. Robust anti-leukemic effects were demonstrated in humanized immunodeficient mice and were sustained longer than by conventional CAR+TCR+ T cells. Terminal-TRAC (TT) CAR T cells offer the possibility of a pre-manufactured, non-HLA-matched CAR cell therapy and will be evaluated in phase 1 trials against B cell malignancies shortly.

29604353	Clostridium difficile is a notorious pathogenic species that can cause severe gastrointestinal infections in humans and animals. C. difficile infection (CDI) results in thousands of deaths worldwide every year. The elucidation of related mechanisms of CDI and exploration of potential therapeutic strategies are largely delayed due to the lack of efficient genetic engineering tools for C. difficile strains.	Plasmids carrying the CRISPR-Cas9 system were constructed and transformed into C. difficile through conjugation. Mutants were identified using colony PCR with primers annealing to the regions flanking the target gene deletion/integration locus. Heat-survival assay was used to compare the sporulation frequency between the mutant with spo0A deletion and the wild type strain. The fluorescence in the mutant with the insertion of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene was inspected under a fluorescent microscope.	An efficient genome editing tool was developed for C. difficile based on the CRISPR-Cas9 system. With this tool, spo0A was deleted with a 100% mutation efficiency. Conversely, an anaerobic GFP gene was successfully inserted into the C. difficile chromosome (with a mutation efficiency of 80%).	The developed CRISPR-Cas9-based genome engineering tool will facilitate functional genomic studies in C. difficile as well as the elucidation of mechanisms related to host-bacteria interaction and pathogenesis of CDI. This will be highly beneficial for the development of innovative strategies for CDI diagnostics and therapies.	S Wang|W Hong|S Dong|ZT Zhang|J Zhang|L Wang|Y Wang

29602742	CRISPR-Cas immune systems integrate short segments of foreign DNA as spacers into the host CRISPR locus to provide molecular memory of infection. Cas4 proteins are widespread in CRISPR-Cas systems and are thought to participate in spacer acquisition, although their exact function remains unknown. Here we show that Bacillus halodurans type I-C Cas4 is required for efficient prespacer processing prior to Cas1-Cas2-mediated integration. Cas4 interacts tightly with the Cas1 integrase, forming a heterohexameric complex containing two Cas1 dimers and two Cas4 subunits. In the presence of Cas1 and Cas2, Cas4 processes double-stranded substrates with long 3' overhangs through site-specific endonucleolytic cleavage. Cas4 recognizes PAM sequences within the prespacer and prevents integration of unprocessed prespacers, ensuring that only functional spacers will be integrated into the CRISPR array. Our results reveal the critical role of Cas4 in maintaining fidelity during CRISPR adaptation, providing a structural and mechanistic model for prespacer processing and integration.

29601573	Plague, caused by Yersinia pestis, was classified as a reemerging infectious disease by the World Health Organization. The five human pneumonic plague cases in Yulong County in 2005 gave rise to the discovery of a Yulong plague focus in Yunnan province, China. Thereafter, continuous wild rodent plague (sylvatic plague) was identified as the main plague reservoir of this focus. In this study, the epizootics in Yulong focus were described, and three molecular typing methods, including the different region (DFR) analysis, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs), and the multiple-locus variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) analysis (MLVA) (14+12), were used for the molecular typing and source tracing of Y. pestis isolates in the Yulong plague focus. Simultaneously, several isolates from the vicinity of Yunnan were used as controls. The results showed that during the 10-year period from 2006 to 2016, an animal plague epidemic occurred in 6 of those years, and 5 villages underwent an animal plague epidemic within a 30-km2 area of the Yulong plague focus. Searching for dead mice was the most effective monitoring method in this plague focus. No positive sample has been found in 6937 captured live rodents thus far, suggesting that the virulence of strains in the Yulong plague focus is stronger and the survival time of mice is shorter after infection. Strains from Lijiang, Sichuan and Tibet were of the same complex based on a typing analysis of DFR and CRISPR. The genetic relationship of Y. pestis illustrated by MLVA "14+12" demonstrates that Tibet and Sichuan strains evolved from the strains 1.IN2 (Qinghai, 1970 and Tibet, 1976), and Lijiang strains are closer to Batang strains (Batang County in Sichuan province, 2011, Himalaya marmot plague foci) in terms of genetic or phylogenic relationships. In conclusion, we have a deeper understanding of this new plague focus throughout this study, which provides a basis for effective prevention and control.

29598153	Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a kind of neuromuscular disease characterized by progressive motor neuron loss in the spinal cord. It is caused by mutations in the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene. SMN1 has a paralogous gene, survival motor neuron 2 (SMN2), in humans that is present in almost all SMA patients. The generation and genetic correction of SMA patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is a viable, autologous therapeutic strategy for the disease. Here, c-Myc-free and non-integrating iPSCs were generated from the urine cells of an SMA patient using an episomal iPSC reprogramming vector, and a unique crRNA was designed that does not have similar sequences (≤3 mismatches) anywhere in the human reference genome. In situ gene conversion of the SMN2 gene to an SMN1-like gene in SMA-iPSCs was achieved using CRISPR/Cpf1 and single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide with a high efficiency of 4/36. Seamlessly gene-converted iPSC lines contained no exogenous sequences and retained a normal karyotype. Significantly, the SMN expression and gems localization were rescued in the gene-converted iPSCs and their derived motor neurons. This is the first report of an efficient gene conversion mediated by Cpf1 homology-directed repair in human cells and may provide a universal gene therapeutic approach for most SMA patients.

29596641	In type I CRISPR-Cas systems, primed adaptation of new spacers into CRISPR arrays occurs when the effector Cascade-crRNA complex recognizes imperfectly matched targets that are not subject to efficient CRISPR interference. Thus, primed adaptation allows cells to acquire additional protection against mobile genetic elements that managed to escape interference. Biochemical and biophysical studies suggested that Cascade-crRNA complexes formed on fully matching targets (subject to efficient interference) and on partially mismatched targets that promote primed adaption are structurally different. Here, we probed Escherichia coli Cascade-crRNA complexes bound to matched and mismatched DNA targets using a magnetic tweezers assay. Significant differences in complex stabilities were observed consistent with the presence of at least two distinct conformations. Surprisingly, in vivo analysis demonstrated that all mismatched targets stimulated robust primed adaptation irrespective of conformational states observed in vitro. Our results suggest that primed adaptation is a direct consequence of a reduced interference efficiency and/or rate and is not a consequence of distinct effector complex conformations on target DNA.

29596631	The Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR associated protein 9 (Cas9) system is an efficient and rapid tool for genome editing. However, its utilization in bacteria suffers challenges such as the risk of repeated recognition and cutting by Cas9. Here we established a two-step genome editing strategy using the Streptococcus pyogenes CRISPR-Cas9 system to achieve a clean mutation with only the target sites into the Escherichia coli genome. This strategy can avoid the risk of repeated cutting by guide RNA (gRNA)/Cas9 without altering the protospacer-adjacent motif or inserting additional silent mutations into the genome. The principles and approaches we developed in this study can be applied to modify coding and non-coding sequences in essential and non-essential genes and can also be used for precise genome editing in other microorganisms.

29595865	This communication is regarding the recent editing of the genome of the human embryo with CRISPR/Cas9 which generated a debate amongst the biological scientists around the world. Editing human germline genes may act as godsend in some serious genetic and other disorders as the genes related to these disorders can be replaced effectively. The scientists are in dilemma whether the human germline gene modification is a boon or bane for the human society. Though editing human germline genes may be an answer to many serious genetic disorders however; it may have unpredictable effects on future generations. The ethical issues regarding the germline editing need further discussion which may have implications on human race and on-going human evolution. Thus, the researchers need to be doubly cautious and some stringent regulations should be framed regarding the various aspects of germ line gene modifications and any potential conflict with nature for future outcome.

29593714	Using the CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technology, we recently produced a number of rabbits with mutations in immune function genes, including FOXN1, PRKDC, RAG1, RAG2, and IL2RG. Seven founder knockout rabbits (F0) and three male IL2RG null (-/y) F1 animals demonstrated severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), characterized by absence or pronounced hypoplasia of the thymus and splenic white pulp, and absence of immature and mature T and B-lymphocytes in peripheral blood. Complete blood count analysis showed severe leukopenia and lymphocytopenia accompanied by severe neutrophilia. Without prophylactic antibiotics, the SCID rabbits universally succumbed to lung infections following weaning. Pathology examination revealed severe heterophilic bronchopneumonia caused by Bordetella bronchiseptica in several animals, but a consistent feature of lung lesions in all animals was a severe interstitial pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis oryctolagi, as confirmed by histological examination and PCR analysis of Pneumocystis genes. The results of this study suggest that these SCID rabbits could serve as a useful model for human SCID to investigate the disease pathogenesis and the development of gene and drug therapies.

29590513	When Kai Kupferschmidt writes about CRISPR-based gene editing in German, he faces an obstacle: there's no exact translation for "editing" that has the same connotations as it has in English. Instead, as he explained last fall at The Hastings Center's preconference symposium on new genetic technologies at the World Conference of Science Journalists, he draws on a variety of phrases, including "genome surgery," which conveys precision in Kupferschmidt's assessment, and "gene scissors," which communicates CRISPR's mechanistic nature. But in any language, explaining CRISPR is difficult. It's a challenge I face at The Hastings Center, where I write about biotechnology for a public audience.	M Klein
29588497	Serum deficiency diseases such as alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency are characterized by reduced function of serum proteins, caused by deleterious genetic mutations. These diseases are promising targets for genetic interventions. Gene therapies using viral vectors have been used to introduce correct copies of the disease-causing gene in preclinical and clinical studies. However, these studies highlighted that disease-alleviating gene expression is lost over time. Integration into a specific chromosomal site could provide lasting therapeutic expression to overcome this major limitation. Additionally, targeted integration could avoid detrimental mutagenesis associated with integrative vectors, such as tumorigenesis or functional gene perturbation. To test if adenoviral vectors can facilitate long-term gene expression through targeted integration, we somatically incorporated the human alpha-1-antitrypsin gene into the ROSA26 "safe harbor" locus in murine livers, using CRISPR/Cas9. We found adenoviral-mediated delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 achieved gene editing outcomes persisting over 200 days. Furthermore, gene knock-in maintained greater levels of the serum protein than provided by episomal expression. Importantly, our "knock-in" approach is generalizable to other serum proteins and supports in vivo cDNA replacement therapy to achieve stable gene expression.

29576390	Screens for genes that orchestrate neural circuit formation in mammals have been hindered by practical constraints of germline mutagenesis. To overcome these limitations, we combined RNA-seq with somatic CRISPR mutagenesis to study synapse development in the mouse retina. Here synapses occur between cellular layers, forming two multilayered neuropils. The outer neuropil, the outer plexiform layer (OPL), contains synapses made by rod and cone photoreceptor axons on rod and cone bipolar dendrites, respectively. We used RNA-seq to identify selectively expressed genes encoding cell surface and secreted proteins and CRISPR-Cas9 electroporation with cell-specific promoters to assess their roles in OPL development. Among the genes identified in this way are Wnt5a and Wnt5b. They are produced by rod bipolars and activate a non-canonical signaling pathway in rods to regulate early OPL patterning. The approach we use here can be applied to other parts of the brain.	S Sarin|E Zuniga-Sanchez|YZ Kurmangaliyev|H Cousins|M Patel|J Hernandez|KX Zhang|MA Samuel|M Morey|JR Sanes|SL Zipursky

29564960	Lactobacillus plantarum (L. plantarum) K25 is a probiotic strain isolated from Tibetan kefir. Previous studies showed that this exopolysaccharide (EPS)-producing strain was antimicrobial active and cold tolerant. These functional traits were evidenced by complete genome sequencing of strain K25 with a circular 3,175,846-bp chromosome and six circular plasmids, encoding 3365 CDSs, 16 rRNA genes and 70 tRNA genes. Genomic analysis of L. plantarum K25 illustrates that this strain contains the previous reported mechanisms of probiotic functionality and cold tolerance, involving plantaricins, lysozyme, bile salt hydrolase, chaperone proteins, osmoprotectant, oxidoreductase, EPSs and terpenes. Interestingly, strain K25 harbors more genes that function in defense mechanisms, and lipid transport and metabolism, in comparison with other L. plantarum strains reported. The present study demonstrates the comprehensive analysis of genes related to probiotic functionalities of an EPS-producing L. plantarum strain based on whole genome sequencing.

29563155	Alanine-, serine-, cysteine-preferring transporter 2 (ASCT2, SLC1A5) is responsible for the uptake of glutamine into cells, a major source of cellular energy and a key regulator of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation. Furthermore, ASCT2 expression has been reported in several human cancers, making it a potential target for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Here we identify ASCT2 as a membrane-trafficked cargo molecule, sorted through a direct interaction with the PDZ domain of sorting nexin 27 (SNX27). Using both membrane fractionation and subcellular localization approaches, we demonstrate that the majority of ASCT2 resides at the plasma membrane. This is significantly reduced within CrispR-mediated SNX27 knockout (KO) cell lines, as it is missorted into the lysosomal degradation pathway. The reduction of ASCT2 levels in SNX27 KO cells leads to decreased glutamine uptake, which, in turn, inhibits cellular proliferation. SNX27 KO cells also present impaired activation of the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway and enhanced autophagy. Taken together, our data reveal a role for SNX27 in glutamine uptake and amino acid-stimulated mTORC1 activation via modulation of ASCT2 intracellular trafficking.

29554922	The InterFeron Induced TransMembrane (IFITM) proteins are interferon stimulated genes that restrict many viruses, including HIV-1. SAMHD1 is another restriction factor blocking replication of HIV-1 and other viruses. Some lentiviruses evolved Vpx/Vpr proteins to degrade SAMHD1. However, this viral antagonism can be perturbed by host mechanisms: a recent study showed that in interferon (IFN) treated THP1 cells, Vpx is unable to degrade SAMHD1. In the present work, we designed an Interferon Stimulated Genes (ISGs)-targeted CRISPR knockout screen in order to identify ISGs regulating this phenotype. We found that IFITM proteins contribute to the IFNα-mediated protection of SAMHD1 by blocking VSV-G-mediated entry of the lentiviral particles delivering Vpx. Consistent with this, IFNα treatment and IFITM expression had no effect when the A-MLV envelope was used for pseudotyping. Using an assay measuring viral entry, we show that IFNα and IFITMs directly block the delivery of Vpx into cells by inhibiting VSV-G viral fusion. Strikingly, the VSV-G envelope was significantly more sensitive to this IFNα entry block and to IFITMs than HIV-1's natural envelope. This highlights important differences between VSV-G pseudotyped and wild-type HIV-1, in particular relative to the pathways they use for viral entry, suggesting that HIV-1 may have evolved to escape restriction factors blocking entry.

29554913	A molecular arms race is progressively being unveiled between prokaryotes and viruses. Prokaryotes utilize CRISPR-mediated adaptive immune systems to kill the invading phages and mobile genetic elements, and in turn, the viruses evolve diverse anti-CRISPR proteins to fight back. The structures of several anti-CRISPR proteins have now been reported, and here we discuss their structural features, with a particular emphasis on topology, to discover their similarities and differences. We summarize the CRISPR-Cas inhibition mechanisms of these anti-CRISPR proteins in their structural context. Considering anti-CRISPRs in this way will provide important clues for studying their origin and evolution.	Y Zhu|F Zhang|Z Huang
29551514	Bacterial class 2 CRISPR-Cas systems utilize a single RNA-guided protein effector to mitigate viral infection. We aggregated genomic data from multiple sources and constructed an expanded database of predicted class 2 CRISPR-Cas systems. A search for novel RNA-targeting systems identified subtype VI-D, encoding dual HEPN domain-containing Cas13d effectors and putative WYL-domain-containing accessory proteins (WYL1 and WYL-b1 through WYL-b5). The median size of Cas13d proteins is 190 to 300 aa smaller than that of Cas13a-Cas13c. Despite their small size, Cas13d orthologs from Eubacterium siraeum (Es) and Ruminococcus sp. (Rsp) are active in both CRISPR RNA processing and targeting, as well as collateral RNA cleavage, with no target-flanking sequence requirements. The RspWYL1 protein stimulates RNA cleavage by both EsCas13d and RspCas13d, demonstrating a common regulatory mechanism for divergent Cas13d orthologs. The small size, minimal targeting constraints, and modular regulation of Cas13d effectors further expands the CRISPR toolkit for RNA manipulation and detection.

29546544	This study develops a new method for detecting target DNA based on Cas9 nuclease, which was named as CARP, representing CRISPR- or Cas9/sgRNAs-associated reverse PCR. This technique detects target DNA in three steps: (1) cleaving the detected DNA sample with Cas9 in complex with a pair of sgRNAs specific to target DNA; (2) ligating the cleaved DNA with DNA ligase; (3) amplifying target DNA with PCR. In the ligation step, the Cas9-cut target DNA was ligated into intramolecular circular or intermolecular concatenated linear DNA. In the PCR step, the ligated DNA was amplified with a pair of reverse primers. The technique was verified by detecting HPV16 and HPV18 L1 genes in nine different human papillomavirus (HPV) subtypes. The technique also detected the L1 and E6-E7 genes of two high-risk HPVs, HPV16 and HPV18, in the genomic DNA of two HPV-positive cervical carcinoma cells (HeLa and SiHa), in which no L1 and E6-E7 genes were detected in the HPV-negative cervical carcinoma cell, C-33a. By performing these proof-of-concept experiments, this study provides a new CRISPR-based DNA detection and typing method. Especially, the CARP method developed by this study is ready for the clinical HPV detection, which was supported by the final clinical sample detection. Graphical abstract CRISPR-associated reverse PCR (CARP) can be used to detect and type target DNA in a simple three-step procedure, cutting, ligation, and amplification.

29535977	Chlamydia is an obligate intracellular bacterium and, as such, has significantly reduced its genome size and content. Although recent advances have allowed for transformation of C. trachomatis with an exogenous plasmid, genetic manipulation of Chlamydia remains challenging. In particular, the ability to create conditional knockouts has not been developed. This is particularly important given the likelihood that most genes within the small genome of Chlamydia may be essential. Here, I describe the feasibility of using CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) based on the catalytically inactive Cas9 variant (dCas9) of Staphylococcus aureus to inducibly, and reversibly, repress gene expression in C. trachomatis. CRISPRi has been developed and used successfully in a variety of bacterial organisms including E. coli and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. I first describe the creation of a single plasmid system for CRISPRi in Chlamydia, targeted to a non-essential gene, incA, that expresses a dispensable inclusion membrane protein. Control transformations of C. trachomatis serovar L2 with plasmids encoding only the dCas9, under the control of an inducible promoter, or only the guide RNA (gRNA) targeted to the 5' UTR of incA, expressed constitutively, failed to prevent expression of IncA. Importantly, expression of dCas9 alone did not have a deleterious effect on chlamydiae. Transformation of C. trachomatis with a plasmid combining the dCas9 and a gRNA targeting incA and induction of expression of the dCas9 resulted in the reversible inhibition of IncA expression. Consequently, conditional knockout mediated by CRISPRi is feasible in Chlamydia. Potential improvements and experimental concerns in using the system are also discussed.	SP Ouellette
29533181	The DUX4 transcription factor is encoded by a retrogene embedded in each unit of the D4Z4 macrosatellite repeat. DUX4 is normally expressed in the cleavage-stage embryo, whereas chromatin repression prevents DUX4 expression in most somatic tissues. Failure of this repression causes facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) due to mis-expression of DUX4 in skeletal muscle. In this study, we used CRISPR/Cas9 engineered chromatin immunoprecipitation (enChIP) locus-specific proteomics to characterize D4Z4-associated proteins. These and other approaches identified the Nucleosome Remodeling Deacetylase (NuRD) and Chromatin Assembly Factor 1 (CAF-1) complexes as necessary for DUX4 repression in human skeletal muscle cells and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. Furthermore, DUX4-induced expression of MBD3L proteins partly relieved this repression in FSHD muscle cells. Together, these findings identify NuRD and CAF-1 as mediators of DUX4 chromatin repression and suggest a mechanism for the amplification of DUX4 expression in FSHD muscle cells.

29529286	Clostridium difficile, a major human enteropathogen, must cope with foreign DNA invaders and multiple stress factors inside the host. We have recently provided an experimental evidence of defensive function of the C. difficile CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-Cas (CRISPR-associated) system important for its survival within phage-rich gut communities. Here, we describe the identification of type I toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems with the first functional antisense RNAs in this pathogen. Through the analysis of deep-sequencing data, we demonstrate the general co-localization with CRISPR arrays for the majority of sequenced C. difficile strains. We provide a detailed characterization of the overlapping convergent transcripts for three selected TA pairs. The toxic nature of small membrane proteins is demonstrated by the growth arrest induced by their overexpression. The co-expression of antisense RNA acting as an antitoxin prevented this growth defect. Co-regulation of CRISPR-Cas and type I TA genes by the general stress response Sigma B and biofilm-related factors further suggests a possible link between these systems with a role in recurrent C. difficile infections. Our results provide the first description of genomic links between CRISPR and type I TA systems within defense islands in line with recently emerged concept of functional coupling of immunity and cell dormancy systems in prokaryotes.

29526756	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) from Prevotella and Francisella 1 (Cpf1) are RNA-guided endonucleases that produce cohesive double-stranded breaks in DNA by specifically recognizing thymidine-rich protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) sequences. Cpf1 is emerging as a powerful genome-editing tool. Despite previous structural studies on various Cpf1 proteins, the apo-structure of Cpf1 remains unknown. In the present study, we determined the solution structure of the Cpf1 protein from Francisella novicida (FnCpf1) with and without CRISPR RNA (crRNA) using small-angle X-ray scattering, providing the insights into the apo-structure of FnCpf1. The apo-structure of FnCpf1 was also visualized using negative staining electron microcopy. When we compared the apo-structure of FnCpf1 with crRNA-bound structure, their overall shapes (a closed form) were similar, suggesting that conformational change upon crRNA binding to FnCpf1 is not drastic, but a local induced fit might occur to recognize PAM sequences. In contrast, the apo Cpf1 from Moraxella bovoculi 237 (MbCpf1) was analyzed as an open form, implying that a large conformational change from an open to a closed form might be required for crRNA binding to MbCpf1. These results suggested that the crRNA-induced conformational changes in Cpf1 differ among species.	K Min|H Yoon|I Jo|NC Ha|KS Jin|JS Kim|HH Lee
29524226	Caspase-3 (CASP3) is a major mediator of apoptosis activated during cellular exposure to cytotoxic drugs, radiotherapy or immunotherapy. It is often used as a marker for efficacy of cancer therapy. However, recent reports indicate that caspase-3 has also non-apoptotic roles such as promotion of tumor relapse and tumor angiogenesis. Therefore, the roles of caspase-3 in tumor progression remain to be defined clearly. In our study, we established caspase-3 knockout (KO) colon cancer cell lines by use of the CRISPR technology. In vitro, caspase-3 knockout HCT116 cells were significantly less clonogenic in soft agar assays. They were also significantly less invasive and more sensitive to radiation and mitomycin C than control cells. In vivo, CASP3KO cells formed tumors at rates similar to control cells but were significantly more sensitive to radiotherapy. They were also less prone to pulmonary metastasis when inoculated either subcutaneously or intravenously. At the mechanistic level, caspase-3 gene knockout appeared to cause reduced EMT phenotypes when compared to parental HCT116 cells. Indeed, they showed significantly increased E-cadherin expression, reduced N-cadherin, Snail, Slug and ZEB1 expression than control cells. Therefore, therapeutic targeting of caspase-3 may not only increase the sensitivity of cancer cell to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, but also inhibit cancer cell invasion and metastasis.

29524151	Genomic regulatory elements that control gene expression play an important role in many traits and diseases. Identifying the regulatory elements associated with each gene or phenotype and understanding the function of that element remain a significant challenge. To address this technological need, we developed CRISPR/Cas9-based epigenomic regulatory element screening (CERES) for improved high-throughput screening of regulatory element activity in the native genomic context. This protocol includes detailed instructions for design and cloning of gRNA libraries, construction of endogenous reporter cell lines via CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-in of fluorescent proteins, overall screen design, and recovery of the gRNA library for enrichment analysis. This protocol will be generally useful for implementing genome engineering technologies for high-throughput functional annotation of putative regulatory elements in their native chromosomal context.

29524148	Epigenetic editing is a promising approach to modulate the local chromatin environment of target genes with the ultimate goal of stable gene expression reprogramming. Epigenetic editing tools minimally consist of a DNA-binding domain and an effector domain. The CRISPR/dCas9 platform, where mutations in the nuclease domains render the Cas9 protein inactive, is widely used to guide epigenetic effectors to their intended genomic loci. Its flexible nature, simple use, and relatively low cost have revolutionized the research field of epigenetic editing. Although effective expression modulation is readily achieved, only a few studies have addressed the maintenance of the induced effects on endogenous loci. Here, we describe a detailed protocol to engineer cells that stably express the CRISPR/dCas9-effectors. The protocol involves modification of published dCas9-based plasmid vectors for easy transfer of the effector domain between the vector designed for transient transfection and the vector used for establishing cell lines stably expressing the dCas9-effector fusion protein. Transient transfection of the dCas9-effector-producing cells with sgRNA-expressing plasmids allows studying of the maintenance of epigenetic editing. Targeting various genes in different chromatin contexts and/or co-targeting multiple CRISPR/dCas9-effectors can be used to unravel rules underlying maintained gene expression reprogramming.

29524128	The completion of genome, epigenome, and transcriptome mapping in multiple cell types has created a demand for precision biomolecular tools that allow researchers to functionally manipulate DNA, reconfigure chromatin structure, and ultimately reshape gene expression patterns. Epigenetic editing tools provide the ability to interrogate the relationship between epigenetic modifications and gene expression. Importantly, this information can be exploited to reprogram cell fate for both basic research and therapeutic applications. Three different molecular platforms for epigenetic editing have been developed: zinc finger proteins (ZFs), transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs), and the system of Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins. These platforms serve as custom DNA-binding domains (DBDs), which are fused to epigenetic modifying domains to manipulate epigenetic marks at specific sites in the genome. The addition and/or removal of epigenetic modifications reconfigures local chromatin structure, with the potential to provoke long-lasting changes in gene transcription. Here we summarize the molecular structure and mechanism of action of ZF, TALE, and CRISPR platforms and describe their applications for the locus-specific manipulation of the epigenome. The advantages and disadvantages of each platform will be discussed with regard to genomic specificity, potency in regulating gene expression, and reprogramming cell phenotypes, as well as ease of design, construction, and delivery. Finally, we outline potential applications for these tools in molecular biology and biomedicine and identify possible barriers to their future clinical implementation.

29523551	Cronobacter strains harboring the CRISPR-Cas system are important foodborne pathogens causing serious neonatal infections. However, the specific role of the CRISPR-Cas system in bacterial evolution remains relatively unexplored. In this study, we investigated the impact of the CRISPR-Cas system on Cronobacter evolution and obtained 137 new whole-genome Cronobacter sequences by next-generation sequencing technology. Among the strains examined (n = 240), 90.6% (193/213) of prevalent species Cronobacter sakazakii, Cronobactermalonaticus, and Cronobacterdublinensis strains had intact CRISPR-Cas systems. Two rare species, Cronobactercondimenti (n = 2) and Cronobacteruniversalis (n = 6), lacked and preserved the CRISPR-Cas system at a low frequency (1/6), respectively. These results suggest that the presence of one CRISPR-Cas system is important for a Cronobacter species to maintain genome homeostasis for survival. The Cronobacter ancestral strain is likely to have harbored both subtype I-E and I-F CRISPR-Cas systems; during the long evolutionary process, subtype I-E was retained while subtype I-F selectively degenerated in Cronobacter species and was even lost by the major Cronobacter pathovars. Moreover, significantly higher CRISPR activity was observed in the plant-associated species Cdublinensis than in the virulence-related species C. sakazakii and Cmalonaticus Similar spacers of CRISPR arrays were rarely found among species, suggesting intensive change through adaptive acquisition and loss. Differentiated CRISPR activity appears to be the product of environmental selective pressure and might contribute to the bidirectional divergence and speciation of CronobacterIMPORTANCE This study reports the evolutionary history of Cronobacter under the selective pressure of the CRISPR-Cas system. One CRISPR-Cas system in Cronobacter is important for maintaining genome homeostasis, whereas two types of systems may be redundant and not conducive to acquiring beneficial DNA for environmental adaptation and pathogenicity. Differentiated CRISPR activity has contributed to the bidirectional divergence and genetic diversity of Cronobacter This perspective makes a significant contribution to the literature by providing new insights into CRISPR-Cas systems in general, while further expanding the roles of CRISPR beyond conferring adaptive immunity and demonstrating a link to adaptation and species divergence in a genus. Moreover, our study provides new insights into the balance between genome homeostasis and the uptake of beneficial DNA related to CRISPR-based activity in the evolution of Cronobacter.

29515088	Prokaryotic type II adaptive immune systems have been developed into the versatile CRISPR technology, which has been widely applied in site-specific genome editing and has revolutionized biomedical research due to its superior efficiency and flexibility. Recent studies have greatly diversified CRISPR technologies by coupling it with various DNA repair mechanisms and targeting strategies. These new advances have significantly expanded the generation of genetically modified animal models, either by including species in which targeted genetic modification could not be achieved previously, or through introducing complex genetic modifications that take multiple steps and cost years to achieve using traditional methods. Herein, we review the recent developments and applications of CRISPR-based technology in generating various animal models, and discuss the everlasting impact of this new progress on biomedical research.

29514032	Familial erythrocytosis with elevated erythropoietin levels is frequently caused by mutations in genes that regulate oxygen-dependent transcription of the gene encoding erythropoietin (EPO). We identified a mutation in EPO that cosegregated with disease with a logarithm of the odds (LOD) score of 3.3 in a family with autosomal dominant erythrocytosis. This mutation, a single-nucleotide deletion (c.32delG), introduces a frameshift in exon 2 that interrupts translation of the main EPO messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript but initiates excess production of erythropoietin from what is normally a noncoding EPO mRNA transcribed from an alternative promoter located in intron 1.

29509513	Several groups have used CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9) for DNA virus editing. In most cases, one single-guide RNA (sgRNA) is used, which produces inconsistencies in gene editing. In this study, we used a swine herpesvirus, pseudorabies virus, as a model to systematically explore the application of CRISPR/Cas9 in DNA virus editing. In our current report, we demonstrated that cotransfection of 2 sgRNAs and a viral genome resulted in significantly better knockout efficiency than the transfection-infection-based approach. This method could result in 100% knockout of ≤3500 bp of viral nonessential large fragments. Furthermore, knockin efficiency was significantly improved by using 2 sgRNAs and was also correlated with the number of background viruses. We also demonstrated that the background viruses were all 2-sgRNA-mediated knockout mutants. Finally, this study demonstrated that the efficacy of gene knockin is determined by the replicative kinetics of background viruses. We propose that CRISPR/Cas9 coupled with 2 sgRNAs creates a powerful tool for DNA virus editing and offers great potential for future applications.-Tang, Y.-D., Guo, J.-C., Wang, T.-Y., Zhao, K., Liu, J.-T., Gao, J.-C., Tian, Z.-J., An, T.-Q., Cai, X.-H.

29507363	The worldwide dissemination of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains has led to the study of their genetic diversity. One of the most used genotyping methods is spoligotyping, based on the detection of spacers in the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) locus. This study assessed the performance of a microbead-based spoligotyping assay using samples extracted from Ziehl-Neelsen-stained smear-microscopy preparations and described the genetic diversity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis among new TB patients in Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples' Region (SNNPR) in Ethiopia. Among the 91 samples analysed, 59 (64.8%) generated spoligotyping patterns. Fifty (84.7%) samples were classified into 12 clusters (mostly Lineage 4 or 3) comprising 2-11 samples and nine had unique spoligotyping patterns. Among the 59 spoligotyping patterns, 25 belonged to the T1 sublineage, 11 to the T3-ETH, 5 to the URAL, 4 to the H3 and 14 to other L4 sublineages. There was a remarkable variation in genetic distribution in SNNPR compared to other regions of the country. Microbead-based spoligotyping is an easy-to-perform, high-throughput assay that can generate genotyping information using material obtained from smear microscopy preparations. The method provides an opportunity to obtain data of the M. tuberculosis genetic epidemiology in settings with limited laboratory resources.

29503867	Cancer genomics consortia have charted the landscapes of numerous human cancers. Whereas some mutations were found in classical oncogenes and tumor suppressors, others have not yet been functionally studied in vivo. To date, a comprehensive assessment of how these genes influence oncogenesis is lacking. We performed direct high-throughput in vivo mapping of functional variants in an autochthonous mouse model of cancer. Using adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) carrying a single-guide RNA (sgRNA) library targeting putative tumor suppressor genes significantly mutated in human cancers, we directly pool-mutagenized the livers of Cre-inducible CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-associated protein 9 (Cas9) mice. All mice that received the AAV-mTSG library developed liver cancer and died within 4 months. We used molecular inversion probe sequencing of the sgRNA target sites to chart the mutational landscape of these tumors, revealing the functional consequence of multiple variants in driving liver tumorigenesis in immunocompetent mice. AAV-mediated autochthonous CRISPR screens provide a powerful means for mapping a provisional functional cancer genome atlas of tumor suppressors in vivo.

29497118	The bacterial CRISPR-Cas system provides adaptive immunity against invading phages. Cas9, an RNA-guided endonuclease, specifically cleaves target DNA substrates and constitutes a well-established platform for genome editing. Recently, anti-CRISPR (Acr) proteins that inhibit Cas9 have been discovered, promising a useful off-switch for Cas9 to avoid undesirable off-target effects. Here, we report the solution structure and dynamics of Listeria monocytogenes AcrIIA4 that inhibits Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpyCas9). AcrIIA4 forms a compact monomeric αβββαα fold comprising three antiparallel β strands flanked by three α-helices and a short 310-helix. AcrIIA4 exhibits distinct backbone dynamics in fast and slow timescales at loop regions that form interaction surfaces for SpyCas9. In particular, the β1-β2 loop that binds to the RuvC domain of SpyCas9 is highly mobile, and the β1-β2 and α2-α3 loops that bind to the RuvC and C-terminal domains of SpyCas9, respectively, undergoes conformational exchanges in microsecond-to-millisecond time scales. AcrIIA4 binds to apo-SpyCas9 with KD ~4.8 μM, which compares to KD ~0.6 nM for AcrIIA4 binding to sgRNA-bound SpyCas9. Since the binary complex between AcrIIA4 and SpyCas9 does not compete with the target DNA binding, it can effectively disable the Cas9 nuclease activity by forming a tight ternary complex in the presence of sgRNA.

29496558	Molecular diagnostics is of critical importance to public health worldwide. It facilitates not only detection and characterization of diseases, but also monitors drug responses, assists in the identification of genetic modifiers and disease susceptibility. Based upon DNA variation, a wide range of molecular-based tests are available to assess/diagnose diseases. The CRISPR-Cas9 system has recently emerged as a versatile tool for biological and medical research. In this system, a single guide RNA (sgRNA) directs the endonuclease Cas9 to a targeted DNA sequence for site-specific manipulation. As designing CRISPR-guided nucleases can be done easily and relatively fast, the CRISPR/Cas9 system has evolved as widely used DNA editing tool. This technique led to a large number of gene editing studies in variety of organisms. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated diagnosis and therapy has picked up pace due to specificity and accuracy of CRISPR. The aim is not only to identify specific pathogens, especially virus but also to repair disease-causing alleles by changing the DNA sequence at the exact location on the chromosome. At present, PCR-based molecular diagnostic testing predominates; however, alternative technologies aimed at reducing genome complexity without PCR are anticipated to gain momentum in the coming years. Furthermore, development of integrated chip devices should allow point-of-care testing and facilitate genetic readouts from single cells and molecules. Together with molecular based therapy CRISPR based diagnostic testing will be a revolution in modern health care settings. In this review, we emphasize on current developing diagnostic techniques based upon CRISPR Cas approach along with short insights on its therapeutic usage.	V Uppada|M Gokara|GK Rasineni

29486366	The CRISPR-Cas system, which was originally identified as a prokaryotic defense mechanism, is increasingly being used for the functional study of genes. This technology, which is simple, inexpensive and efficient, has aroused a lot of enthusiasm in the scientific community since its discovery, and every month many publications emanate from very different communities reporting on the use of CRISPR-Cas9. Currently, there are no vaccines to control neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) caused by Trypanosomatidae, particularly Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) and Animal African Trypanosomoses (AAT), and treatments are cumbersome and sometimes not effective enough. CRISPR-Cas9 has the potential to functionally analyze new target molecules that could be used for therapeutic and vaccine purposes. In this review, after briefly describing CRIPSR-Cas9 history and how it works, different applications on diseases, especially on parasitic diseases, are reviewed. We then focus the review on the use of CRISPR-Cas9 editing on Trypanosomatidae parasites, the causative agents of NTDs, which are still a terrible burden for human populations in tropical regions, and their vectors.

29486239	The RNA-guided nucleases derived from the CRISPR-Cas systems in bacteria and archaea have found numerous applications in biotechnology, including genome editing, imaging, and gene regulation. However, the discovery of novel Cas nucleases has outpaced their characterization and subsequent exploitation. A key step in characterizing Cas nucleases is determining which protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) sequences they recognize. Here, we report advances to an in vitro method based on an E. coli cell-free transcription-translation system (TXTL) to rapidly elucidate PAMs recognized by Cas nucleases. The method obviates the need for cloning Cas nucleases or gRNAs, does not require the purification of protein or RNA, and can be performed in less than a day. To advance our previously published method, we incorporated an internal GFP cleavage control to assess the extent of library cleavage as well as Sanger sequencing of the cleaved library to assess PAM depletion prior to next-generation sequencing. We also detail the methods needed to construct all relevant DNA constructs, and how to troubleshoot the assay. We finally demonstrate the technique by determining PAM sequences recognized by the Neisseria meningitidis Cas9, revealing subtle sequence requirements of this highly specific PAM. The overall method offers a rapid means to identify PAMs recognized by diverse CRISPR nucleases, with the potential to greatly accelerate our ability to characterize and harness novel CRISPR nucleases across their many uses.

29482606	Previously, we developed the engineered DNA-binding molecule-mediated chromatin immunoprecipitation (enChIP) technology, which isolates specific genomic regions while preserving their molecular interactions. In enChIP, the locus of interest is tagged with engineered DNA-binding molecules such as the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) system, consisting of a catalytically inactive form of Cas9 (dCas9) and guide RNA, followed by affinity purification of the tagged locus to allow identification of associated molecules. In our previous studies, we used a 3xFLAG-tagged CRISPR system from Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes). In this study, to increase the flexibility of enChIP, we used the CRISPR system from Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) along with different epitope tags.	We generated a plasmid expressing S. aureus dCas9 (Sa-dCas9) fused to a nuclear localization signal (NLS) and a 3xFLAG-tag (Sa-dCas9-3xFLAG). The yields of enChIP using Sa-dCas9-3xFLAG were comparable to those using S. pyogenes dCas9 fused with an NLS and a 3xFLAG-tag (3xFLAG-Sp-dCas9). We also generated another enChIP system using Sp-dCas9 fused with an NLS and a 2xAM-tag (Sp-dCas9-2xAM). We obtained high enChIP yields using this system as well. Our findings indicate that these tools will increase the flexibility of enChIP analysis.	T Fujita|M Yuno|H Fujii
29480524	We developed the engineered DNA-binding molecule-mediated chromatin immunoprecipitation (enChIP) technology to isolate specific genomic regions while retaining their molecular interactions. In enChIP, the locus of interest is tagged with an engineered DNA-binding molecule, such as a modified form of the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) system containing a guide RNA (gRNA) and a catalytically inactive form of Cas9 (dCas9). The locus is then affinity-purified to enable identification of associated molecules. In this study, we generated transgenic mice expressing 3xFLAG-tagged Streptococcus pyogenes dCas9 (3xFLAG-dCas9) and retrovirally transduced gRNA into primary CD4+ T cells from these mice for enChIP. Using this approach, we achieved high yields of enChIP at the targeted genomic region. Our novel transgenic mouse lines provide a valuable tool for enChIP analysis in primary mouse cells.

29479779	Amino acid transporters (AATs) play indispensable roles in nutrient allocation during plant development. In this study, we demonstrated that inhibiting expression of the rice amino acid transporter OsAAP3 increased grain yield due to a formation of larger numbers of tillers as a result of increased bud outgrowth. Elevated expression of OsAAP3 in transgenic plants resulted in significantly higher amino acid concentrations of Lys, Arg, His, Asp, Ala, Gln, Gly, Thr and Tyr, and inhibited bud outgrowth and rice tillering. However, RNAi of OsAAP3 decreased significantly Arg, Lys, Asp and Thr concentrations to a small extent, and thus promoted bud outgrowth, increased significantly tiller numbers and effective panicle numbers per plant, and further enhanced significantly grain yield and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). The promoter sequences of OsAAP3 showed some divergence between Japonica and Indica rice, and expression of the gene was higher in Japonica, which produced fewer tillers than Indica. We generated knockout lines of OsAAP3 on Japonica ZH11 and KY131 using CRISPR technology and found that grain yield could be increased significantly. These results suggest that manipulation of OsAAP3 expression could be used to increase grain yield in rice.	K Lu|B Wu|J Wang|W Zhu|H Nie|J Qian|W Huang|Z Fang

29473500	Genome editing mediated by Clustered Regularly Interspaced Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) and its associated proteins (Cas) has recently been considered to be used as efficient, rapid and site-specific tool in the modification of endogenous genes in biomedically important cell types and whole organisms. It has become a predictable and precise method of choice for genome engineering by specifying a 20-nt targeting sequence within its guide RNA. Firstly, this review aims to describe the biology of CRISPR system. Next, the applications of CRISPR-Cas9 in various ways, such as efficient generation of a wide variety of biomedically important cellular models as well as those of animals, modifying epigenomes, conducting genome-wide screens, gene therapy, labelling specific genomic loci in living cells, metabolic engineering of yeast and bacteria and endogenous gene expression regulation by an altered version of this system were reviewed.

29467456	The genome-wide clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) screen is a powerful tool used to identify therapeutic targets that can be harnessed for cancer treatment. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of genome-wide CRISPR screening to identify druggable genes associated with sorafenib-treated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A genome-scale CRISPR knockout (GeCKO v2) library containing 123,411 single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) was used to identify loss-of-function mutations conferring sorafenib resistance upon HCC cells. Resistance gene screens identified SGOL1 as an indicator of prognosis of patients treated with sorafenib. Of the 19,050 genes tested, the knockout screen identified inhibition of SGOL1 expression as the most-effective genetic suppressor of sorafenib activity. Analysis of the survival of 210 patients with HCC after hepatic resection revealed that high SGOL1 expression shortened overall survival (P = 0.021). Further, matched pairs analysis of the TCGA database revealed that SGOL1 is differentially expressed. When we used a lentivirus Cas9 vector to determine the effect of targeting SGOL1 with a specific sgRNA in HCC cells, we found that SGOL1 expression was efficiently inhibited and that loss of SGOL1 was associated with sorafenib resistance. Further, loss of SGOL1 from HCC cell decreased the cytotoxicity of sorafenib in vivo. We conclude that the CRISPR screen is a powerful tool for therapeutic target analysis of sorafenib treatment and that SGOL1 serves as a druggable target for HCC treated with sorafenib and an indicator of prognosis.

29467398	The application of viral and cellular metagenomics to natural environments has expanded our understanding of the structure, functioning, and diversity of microbial and viral communities. The high diversity of many communities, e.g., soils, surface ocean waters, and animal-associated microbiomes, make it difficult to establish virus-host associations at the single cell (rather than population) level, assign cellular hosts, or determine the extent of viral host range from metagenomics studies alone. Here, we combine single-cell sequencing with environmental metagenomics to characterize the structure of virus-host associations in a Yellowstone National Park (YNP) hot spring microbial community. Leveraging the relatively low diversity of the YNP environment, we are able to overlay evidence at the single-cell level with contextualized viral and cellular community structure. Combining evidence from hexanucelotide analysis, single cell read mapping, network-based analytics, and CRISPR-based inference, we conservatively estimate that >60% of cells contain at least one virus type and a majority of these cells contain two or more virus types. Of the detected virus types, nearly 50% were found in more than 2 cellular clades, indicative of a broad host range. The new lens provided by the combination of metaviromics and single-cell genomics reveals a network of virus-host interactions in extreme environments, provides evidence that extensive virus-host associations are common, and further expands the unseen impact of viruses on cellular life.

29467265	Butterflies have evolved different colour patterns on their dorsal and ventral wing surfaces to serve different signalling functions, yet the developmental mechanisms controlling surface-specific patterning are still unknown. Here, we mutate both copies of the transcription factor apterous in Bicyclus anynana butterflies using CRISPR/Cas9 and show that apterous A, expressed dorsally, functions both as a repressor and modifier of ventral wing colour patterns, as well as a promoter of dorsal sexual ornaments in males. We propose that the surface-specific diversification of wing patterns in butterflies proceeded via the co-option of apterous A or its downstream effectors into various gene regulatory networks involved in the differentiation of discrete wing traits. Further, interactions between apterous and sex-specific factors such as doublesex may have contributed to the origin of sexually dimorphic surface-specific patterns. Finally, we discuss the evolution of eyespot number diversity in the family Nymphalidae within the context of developmental constraints due to apterous regulation.	A Prakash|A Monteiro

29463653	Staphylococcus aureus is an important human pathogen, but studies of the organism have suffered from the lack of a robust tool set for its genetic and genomic manipulation. Here we report the development of a system for the facile and high-throughput genomic engineering of S. aureus using single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) oligonucleotide recombineering coupled with clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9-mediated counterselection. We identify recombinase EF2132, derived from Enterococcus faecalis, as being capable of integrating single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides into the S. aureus genome. We found that EF2132 can readily mediate recombineering across multiple characterized strains (3 of 3 tested) and primary clinical isolates (6 of 6 tested), typically yielding thousands of recombinants per transformation. Surprisingly, we also found that some S. aureus strains are naturally recombinogenic at measurable frequencies when oligonucleotides are introduced by electroporation, even without exogenous recombinase expression. We construct a temperature-sensitive, two-vector system which enables conditional recombineering and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated counterselection in S. aureus without permanently introducing exogenous genetic material or unintended genetic lesions. We demonstrate the ability of this system to efficiently and precisely engineer point mutations and large single-gene deletions in the S. aureus genome and to yield highly enriched populations of engineered recombinants even in the absence of an externally selectable phenotype. By virtue of utilizing inexpensive, commercially synthesized synthetic DNA oligonucleotides as substrates for recombineering and counterselection, this system provides a scalable, versatile, precise, inexpensive, and generally useful tool for producing isogenic strains in S. aureus which will enable the high-throughput functional assessment of genome variation and gene function across multiple strain backgrounds.IMPORTANCE Engineering genetic changes in bacteria is critical to understanding the function of particular genes or mutations but is currently a laborious and technically challenging process to perform for the important human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus In an effort to develop methods which are rapid, easy, scalable, versatile, and inexpensive, here we describe a system for incorporating synthetic, mutagenic DNA molecules into the S. aureus genome and for eliminating cells that lack the engineered mutation. This method allows efficient, precise, and high-throughput genetic engineering of S. aureus strains and will facilitate studies seeking to address a variety of issues about the function of particular genes and specific mutations.

29462720	The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) system has emerged as the revolutionary platform for DNA targeting. This system uses a site-specific RNA guide to direct a CRISPR effector (e.g., Cas9 and Cpf1) to a DNA target. Here, we elaborate a general strategy to simultaneously express multiple guide RNAs (gRNA) and CRISPR RNAs (crRNA) from introns of Cas9 and Cpf1. This method utilizes the endogenous tRNA processing system or crRNA processing activity of Cpf1 to cleave the spliced intron that contains tRNA-gRNA polycistron or crRNA-crRNA array. We demonstrated that the tRNA-gRNA intron is able to fuse with Cas9 as one gene. Such a hybrid gene could be expressed using one polymerase II promoter, and exhibited high efficiency and robustness in simultaneously targeting multiple sites. We also implemented this strategy in Cpf1-mediated genome editing using intronic tRNA-crRNA and crRNA-crRNA arrays. Interestingly, hybrid genes containing Cpf1 and intronic crRNA array exhibited remarkably increased efficiency compared with the conventional Cpf1 vectors. Taken together, this study presents a method to express CRISPR reagents from one hybrid gene to increase genome-editing efficiency and capacity. Owing to its simplicity and versatility, this method could be broadly used to develop sophisticated CRISPR tools in eukaryotes.	D Ding|K Chen|Y Chen|H Li|K Xie
29461055	Since the initial characterization of Streptococcus pyogenes CRISPR/Cas9 as a powerful gene-editing tool, it has been widely accepted that Cas9 generates blunt-ended DNA products by concerted cleavage of the target (tDNA) and non-target (ntDNA) strands three nucleotides away from the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) by HNH and RuvC nuclease active sites, respectively. Following initial DNA cleavage, RuvC catalyzes 3'→5' degradation of the ntDNA resulting in DNA products of various lengths. Here, we found that Cas9 selects multiple sites for initial ntDNA cleavage and preferentially generates staggered-ended DNA products containing single-nucleotide 5'-overhangs. We also quantitatively evaluated 3'→5' post-cleavage trimming (PCT) activity of RuvC to find that ntDNA degradation continues up to the -10 position on the PAM distal DNA product and is kinetically significant when compared to extremely slow DNA product release. We also discovered a previously unidentified 5'→3' PCT activity of RuvC which can shorten the PAM proximal ntDNA product by precisely one nucleotide with a comparable rate as the 3'→5' PCT activity. Taken together, our results demonstrate that RuvC-catalyzed PCT ultimately generates DNA fragments with heterogeneous ends following initial DNA cleavage including a PAM proximal fragment with a blunt end and a PAM distal fragment with a staggered-end, 3'-recessed on the ntDNA strand. These kinetic and biochemical findings underline the importance of temporal control of Cas9 during gene-editing experiments and help explain the patterns of nucleotide insertions at sites of Cas9-catalyzed gene modification in vivo.

29460422	The CRISPR/Cas9 system has been widely used for multiplex genome engineering of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, its application in manipulating industrial yeast strains is less successful, probably due to the genome complexity and low copy numbers of gRNA expression plasmids. Here we developed an efficient CRISPR/Cas9 system for industrial yeast strain engineering by using our previously engineered plasmids with increased copy numbers. Four genes in both a diploid strain (Ethanol Red, 8 alleles in total) and a triploid strain (ATCC 4124, 12 alleles in total) were knocked out in a single step with 100% efficiency. This system was used to construct xylose-fermenting, lactate-producing industrial yeast strains, in which ALD6, PHO13, LEU2, and URA3 were disrupted in a single step followed by the introduction of a xylose utilization pathway and a lactate biosynthetic pathway on auxotrophic marker plasmids. The optimized CRISPR/Cas9 system provides a powerful tool for the development of industrial yeast based microbial cell factories.	J Lian|Z Bao|S Hu|H Zhao
29459677	Primary cilia organize Hedgehog signaling and shape embryonic development, and their dysregulation is the unifying cause of ciliopathies. We conducted a functional genomic screen for Hedgehog signaling by engineering antibiotic-based selection of Hedgehog-responsive cells and applying genome-wide CRISPR-mediated gene disruption. The screen can robustly identify factors required for ciliary signaling with few false positives or false negatives. Characterization of hit genes uncovered novel components of several ciliary structures, including a protein complex that contains δ-tubulin and ε-tubulin and is required for centriole maintenance. The screen also provides an unbiased tool for classifying ciliopathies and showed that many congenital heart disorders are caused by loss of ciliary signaling. Collectively, our study enables a systematic analysis of ciliary function and of ciliopathies, and also defines a versatile platform for dissecting signaling pathways through CRISPR-based screening.

29457792	Several groups recently coupled CRISPR perturbations and single-cell RNA-seq for pooled genetic screens. We demonstrate that vector designs of these studies are susceptible to ∼50% swapping of guide RNA-barcode associations because of lentiviral template switching. We optimized a published alternative, CROP-seq, in which the guide RNA also serves as the barcode, and here confirm that this strategy performs robustly and doubled the rate at which guides are assigned to cells to 94%.

29451908	CRISPR/Cas9-based approaches have greatly facilitated targeted genomic deletions. Contrary to coding genes however, which can be functionally knocked out by frame-shift mutagenesis, non-coding RNA (ncRNA) gene knockouts have remained challenging. Here we present a universal ncRNA knockout approach guided by epigenetic hallmarks, which enables robust gene silencing even in provisionally annotated gene loci. We build on previous work reporting the presence of overlapping histone H3 lysine 4 tri-methylation (H3K4me3) and DNaseI hypersensitivity sites around the transcriptional start sites of most genes. We demonstrate that excision of this gene-proximal signature leads to loss of microRNA and lincRNA transcription and reveals ncRNA phenotypes. Exemplarily we demonstrate silencing of the constitutively transcribed MALAT1 lincRNA gene as well as of the inducible miR-146a and miR-155 genes in human monocytes. Our results validate a role of miR-146a and miR-155 in negative feedback control of the activity of inflammation master-regulator NFκB and suggest that cell-cycle control is a unique feature of miR-155. We suggest that our epigenetically guided CRISPR approach may improve existing ncRNA knockout strategies and contribute to the development of high-confidence ncRNA phenotyping applications.

29449584	The necroptotic cell death pathway is a key component of human pathogen defense that can become aberrantly derepressed during tissue homeostasis to contribute to multiple types of tissue damage and disease. While formation of the necrosome kinase signaling complex containing RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL has been extensively characterized, additional mechanisms of its regulation and effector functions likely remain to be discovered. We screened 19,883 mouse protein-coding genes by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene knockout for resistance to cytokine-induced necroptosis and identified 112 regulators and mediators of necroptosis, including 59 new candidate pathway components with minimal or no effect on cell growth in the absence of necroptosis induction. Among these, we further characterized the function of PTBP1, an RNA binding protein whose activity is required to maintain RIPK1 protein abundance by regulating alternative splice-site selection.

29449560	Interleukin 7 receptor (il7r), a transmembrane receptor, belongs to the type I cytokine receptor family. Il7r is involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, such as multiple sclerosis. Targeted knockdown of il7r leads to delayed myelination, highlighting the potential role of il7r in the development of the nervous system. Zebrafish is an ideal model for the study of neurogenesis; moreover, the il7r gene is highly conserved between zebrafish and human. The aim of the present study was to investigate the novel function of il7r in neurogenesis. First, an il7r -/- homozygous mutant line was generated by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) technology. Second, the gross development of il7r-/- mutants revealed remarkably smaller eyes and delayed retinal neurodifferentiation. Third, microarray analysis revealed that genes associated with the phototransduction signalling pathway were strongly down-regulated in il7r -/- mutants. Finally, the results from behavioural tests indicated that visual function was impaired in il7r -/- mutant larvae. Overall, our data demonstrate that a lack of il7r retards the development of the retina. Thus, il7r is an essential molecule for maintaining normal retinal development in zebrafish.

29449551	Spermatogenesis defects concern millions of men worldwide, yet the vast majority remains undiagnosed. Here we report men with primary infertility due to multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella with severe disorganization of the sperm axoneme, a microtubule-based structure highly conserved throughout evolution. Whole-exome sequencing was performed on 78 patients allowing the identification of 22 men with bi-allelic mutations in DNAH1 (n = 6), CFAP43 (n = 10), and CFAP44 (n = 6). CRISPR/Cas9 created homozygous CFAP43/44 male mice that were infertile and presented severe flagellar defects confirming the human genetic results. Immunoelectron and stimulated-emission-depletion microscopy performed on CFAP43 and CFAP44 orthologs in Trypanosoma brucei evidenced that both proteins are located between the doublet microtubules 5 and 6 and the paraflagellar rod. Overall, we demonstrate that CFAP43 and CFAP44 have a similar structure with a unique axonemal localization and are necessary to produce functional flagella in species ranging from Trypanosoma to human.

Many of the most cutting-edge advances in genome engineering are encompassed in the Research Articles, Reviews, and Perspectives in this special issue, often with an eye toward future directions for the field. Yet, many questions remain at this new frontier.

29448634	The present study was designed to test a new strategy for comparing the off-target effects of CRISPR/cas9 employing a blue/white colony based assay. Eight types of AmpR plasmids with matched, one base mismatched, two bases mismatched and three bases mismatched targets were constructed. The wild typed alpha peptide of the beta-glactosidase gene and some with mutations, chosen as the targets, were successfully subcloned into the plasmids in an inframe pattern. The relevant gRNA and cas9 were subcloned into the ChloR plasmid. Transformation of the plasmid harboring the target gene yielded blue colonies, while white colonies formed in the plates following the co-transformation of target gene plasmid and the CRISPR/cas9 plasmid. Colonies in different levels of blue color were formed from the plasmids having completely matched target and mismatched targets. The appearance of different blue levels following the co-transformation of the different target plasmid and CRISPR/cas9 plasmid qualitatively indicated the effectiveness of the gRNA, while the ratio of the AMP/CL colonies can be used for relatively quantitative evaluation. The target and off-target effects among different targets of gRNA were differentially identifiable and these effects in turn demonstrated the effectiveness of the blue to white assay. Either the qualitative or the quantitative analysis of the blue to white depends on the final interactions among the target, the cas9 and the gRNA. Clearly, when co-transformation is replaced by single transformation using a specialized nanoparticle containing these three components, the target and off-target effect will be more accurately evaluated. Thus, this study provided a model for application of nanoparticle in gene editing studies.	Q Wang|L Xiao|L Zhou|W Sun|C Xing|K Li|N He
29447206	Anti-HCMV treatments used in immunosuppressed patients reduce viral replication, but resistant viral strains can emerge. Moreover, these drugs do not target latently infected cells. We designed two anti-viral CRISPR/Cas9 strategies to target the UL122/123 gene, a key regulator of lytic replication and reactivation from latency. The singleplex strategy contains one gRNA to target the start codon. The multiplex strategy contains three gRNAs to excise the complete UL122/123 gene. Primary fibroblasts and U-251 MG cells were transduced with lentiviral vectors encoding Cas9 and one or three gRNAs. Both strategies induced mutations in the target gene and a concomitant reduction of immediate early (IE) protein expression in primary fibroblasts. Further detailed analysis in U-251 MG cells showed that the singleplex strategy induced 50% of indels in the viral genome, leading to a reduction in IE protein expression. The multiplex strategy excised the IE gene in 90% of all viral genomes and thus led to the inhibition of IE protein expression. Consequently, viral genome replication and late protein expression were reduced by 90%. Finally, the production of new viral particles was nearly abrogated. In conclusion, the multiplex anti-UL122/123 CRISPR/Cas9 system can target the viral genome efficiently enough to significantly prevent viral replication.

29446747	Induced pluripotent stem cells hold tremendous potential for biological and therapeutic applications. The development of efficient technologies for targeted genome alteration of stem cells in disease models is a prerequisite for utilizing stem cells to their full potential. The revolutionary technology for genome editing known as the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-associated protein 9 (Cas9) system is recently recognized as a powerful tool for editing DNA at specific loci.	The ease of use of the CRISPR-Cas9 technology will allow us to improve our understanding of genomic variation in disease processes via cellular and animal models. More recently, this system was modified to repress (CRISPR interference, CRISPRi) or activate (CRISPR activation, CRISPRa) gene expression without alterations in the DNA, which amplified the scope of applications of CRISPR systems for stem cell biology.	Here, we highlight latest advances of CRISPR-associated applications in human pluripotent stem cells. The challenges and future prospects of CRISPR-based systems for human research are also discussed.	Y Zhang|D Sastre|F Wang
29445268	Genetic variations play an important role in the clinical presentation and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), especially early-onset Alzheimer's disease. Hundreds of mutations have been reported with the majority resulting from alterations in β-amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PSEN1), or presenilin 2 (PSEN2) genes. The roles of these mutations in the pathogenesis of AD have been classically confirmed or refuted through functional studies, where the mutations are cloned, inserted into cell lines, and monitored for changes in various properties including cell survival, amyloid production, or Aβ42/40 ratio. However, these verification studies tend to be expensive, time consuming, and inconsistent. Recently, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR-Cas9) system was developed, which improves sequence-specific gene editing in cell lines, organs, and animals. CRISPR-Cas9 is a promising tool for the generation of models of human genetic diseases and could facilitate the establishment of new animal AD models and the observation of dynamic bioprocesses in AD. Here, we recapitulated the history of CRISPR technology, recent progress, and, especially, its potential applications in AD-related genetic, animal modeling, and functional studies.

29445114	Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a ciliopathy characterized by retinal degeneration, obesity, polydactyly, renal disease and mental retardation. CCDC28B is a BBS-associated protein that we have previously shown plays a role in cilia length regulation whereby its depletion results in shortened cilia both in cells and Danio rerio (zebrafish). At least part of that role is achieved by its interaction with the mTORC2 component SIN1, but the mechanistic details of this interaction and/or additional functions that CCDC28B might play in the context of cilia remain poorly understood. Here we uncover a novel interaction between CCDC28B and the kinesin 1 molecular motor that is relevant to cilia. CCDC28B interacts with kinesin light chain 1 (KLC1) and the heavy chain KIF5B. Notably, depletion of these kinesin 1 components results in abnormally elongated cilia. Furthermore, through genetic interaction studies we demonstrate that kinesin 1 regulates ciliogenesis through CCDC28B. We show that kinesin 1 regulates the subcellular distribution of CCDC28B, unexpectedly, inhibiting its nuclear accumulation, and a ccdc28b mutant missing a nuclear localization motif fails to rescue the phenotype in zebrafish morphant embryos. Therefore, we uncover a previously unknown role of kinesin 1 in cilia length regulation that relies on the BBS related protein CCDC28B.

29444806	Cryptococcus neoformans is a fungal pathogen that claims hundreds of thousands of lives annually. Targeted genetic manipulation through biolistic transformation in C. neoformans drove the investigation of this clinically important pathogen at the molecular level. Although costly and inefficient, biolistic transformation remains the major method for editing the Cryptococcus genome as foreign DNAs introduced by other methods such as electroporation are predominantly not integrated into the genome. Although the majority of DNAs introduced by biolistic transformation are stably inherited, the transformation efficiency and the homologous integration rate (∼1-10%) are low. Here, we developed a Transient CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat)-Cas9 coupled with Electroporation (TRACE) system for targeted genetic manipulations in the C. neoformans species complex. This method took advantages of efficient genome integration due to double-strand breaks created at specific sites by the transient CRISPR-Cas9 system and the high transformation efficiency of electroporation. We demonstrated that TRACE can efficiently generate precise single-gene deletion mutants using the ADE2 locus as an example. This system can also effectively delete multiple genes in a single transformation, as evident by the successful generation of quadruple mfα1Δ2Δ3Δ4Δ mutants. In addition to generating gene deletion mutants, we complemented the ade2Δ mutant by integrating a wild-type ADE2 allele at the "safe haven" region (SH2) via homologous recombination using TRACE. Interestingly, introduced DNAs can be inserted at a designated genetic site without any homologous sequences, opening up numerous other applications. We expect that TRACE, an efficient, versatile, and cost-effective gene editing approach, will greatly accelerate research in this field.	Y Fan|X Lin
29442507	The discovery of prokaryotic adaptive immunity prompted widespread use of the RNA-guided clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-associated (Cas) endonuclease Cas9 for genetic engineering. However, its kinetic mechanism remains undefined, and details of DNA cleavage are poorly characterized. Here, we establish a kinetic mechanism of Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 from guide-RNA binding through DNA cleavage and product release. Association of DNA to the binary complex of Cas9 and guide-RNA is rate-limiting during the first catalytic turnover, while DNA cleavage from a pre-formed ternary complex of Cas9, guide-RNA, and DNA is rapid. Moreover, an extremely slow release of DNA products essentially restricts Cas9 to be a single-turnover enzyme. By simultaneously measuring the contributions of the HNH and RuvC nuclease activities of Cas9 to DNA cleavage, we also uncovered the kinetic basis by which HNH conformationally regulates the RuvC cleavage activity. Together, our results provide crucial kinetic and functional details regarding Cas9 which will inform gene-editing experiments, guide future research to understand off-target DNA cleavage by Cas9, and aid in the continued development of Cas9 as a biotechnological tool.

29440357	Basement membranes are extracellular matrices essential for embryonic development in animals. Peroxidasins are extracellular peroxidases implicated in the unique sulfilimine cross-links between type IV basement membrane collagens. Loss of function in the Caenorhabditis elegans peroxidasin PXN-2 results in fully penetrant embryonic or larval lethality. Using genetic suppressor screening, we find that the requirement for PXN-2 in development can be bypassed by gain of function in multiple genes encoding other basement membrane components, or proteins implicated in cell-matrix attachment. We identify multiple alleles of let-805, encoding the transmembrane protein myotactin, which suppress phenotypes of pxn-2 null mutants and of other basement membrane mutants such as F-spondin/spon-1 These let-805 suppressor alleles cause missense alterations in two pairs of FNIII repeats in the extracellular domain; they act dominantly and have no detectable phenotypes alone, suggesting they cause gain of function. We also identify suppressor missense mutations affecting basement membrane components type IV collagen (emb-9, let-2) and perlecan (unc-52), as well as a mutation affecting spectraplakin (vab-10), a component of the epidermal cytoskeleton. These suppressor alleles do not bypass the developmental requirement for core structural proteins of the basement membrane such as laminin or type IV collagen. In conclusion, putative gain-of-function alterations in matrix proteins or in cell-matrix receptors can overcome the requirement for certain basement membrane proteins in embryonic development, revealing previously unknown plasticity in the genetic requirements for the extracellular matrix.

29438517	While CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing has transformed yeast research, current plasmids and cassettes for Cas9 and guide-RNA expression are species specific. CRISPR tools that function in multiple yeast species could contribute to the intensifying research on non-conventional yeasts. A plasmid carrying a pangenomic origin of replication and two constitutive expression cassettes for Cas9 and ribozyme-flanked gRNAs was constructed. Its functionality was tested by analyzing inactivation of the ADE2 gene in four yeast species. In two Kluyveromyces species, near-perfect targeting (≥96%) and homologous repair (HR) were observed in at least 24% of transformants. In two Ogataea species, Ade- mutants were not observed directly after transformation, but prolonged incubation of transformed cells resulted in targeting efficiencies of 9% to 63% mediated by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). In an Ogataea parapolymorpha ku80 mutant, deletion of OpADE2 mediated by HR was achieved, albeit at low efficiencies (<1%). Furthermore the expression of a dual polycistronic gRNA array enabled simultaneous interruption of OpADE2 and OpYNR1 demonstrating flexibility of ribozyme-flanked gRNA design for multiplexing. While prevalence of NHEJ prevented HR-mediated editing in Ogataea, such targeted editing was possible in Kluyveromyces. This broad-host-range CRISPR/gRNA system may contribute to exploration of Cas9-mediated genome editing in other Saccharomycotina yeasts.

29425498	Due to their specificity, efficiency, and ease of programming, CRISPR-associated nucleases are popular tools for genome editing. On the genomic scale, these nucleases still show considerable off-target activity though, posing a serious obstacle to the development of therapies. Off targeting is often minimized by choosing especially high-specificity guide sequences, based on algorithms that codify empirically determined off-targeting rules. A lack of mechanistic understanding of these rules has so far necessitated their ad hoc implementation, likely contributing to the limited precision of present algorithms. To understand the targeting rules, we kinetically model the physics of guide-target hybrid formation. Using only four parameters, our model elucidates the kinetic origin of the experimentally observed off-targeting rules, thereby rationalizing the results from both binding and cleavage assays. We favorably compare our model to published data from CRISPR-Cas9, CRISPR-Cpf1, CRISPR-Cascade, as well as the human Argonaute 2 system.	M Klein|B Eslami-Mossallam|DG Arroyo|M Depken
29424307	RNA-guided endonuclease as a versatile genome editing technology opened new windows in various fields of biology. The simplicity of this revolutionary technique provides a promising future for its application in a broad range of approaches from functional annotation of genes to diseases, to genetic manipulation and gene therapy. Besides the site-specific activity of Cas9 endonuclease, the unintended cleavage known as off-target effect is still a major challenge for this genome editing technique.	Various strategies have been developed to resolve this bottleneck including development of new softwares for designing optimized guide RNA (gRNA), engineering Cas9 enzyme, improvement in off-target detection assays, etc. Results: This review dedicated to discuss on methods that have been used for optimizing Cas9, specificity with the aim of improving this technology for therapeutic applications.

29411201	Bacterial-bacteriophage interactions are a well-studied and ecologically-important aspect of microbiology. Many commercial fermentation processes are susceptible to bacteriophage infections due to the use of high-density, clonal cell populations. Lytic infections of bacterial cells in these fermentations are especially problematic due to their negative impacts on product quality, asset utilization, and fouling of downstream equipment. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a novel lytic bacteriophage, referred to as bacteriophage DTL that is capable of rapid lytic infections of an Escherichia coli K12 strain used for commercial production of 1,3-propanediol (PDO). The bacteriophage genome was sequenced and annotated, which identified 67 potential open-reading frames (ORF). The tail fiber ORF, the largest in the genome, was most closely related to bacteriophage RTP, a T1-like bacteriophage reported from a commercial E. coli fermentation process in Germany. To eliminate virulence, both a fully functional Streptococcus thermophilus CRISPR3 plasmid and a customized S. thermophilus CRISPR3 plasmid with disabled spacer acquisition elements and seven spacers targeting the bacteriophage DTL genome were constructed. Both plasmids were separately integrated into a PDO production strain, which was subsequently infected with bacteriophage DTL. The native S. thermophilus CRISPR3 operon was shown to decrease phage susceptibility by approximately 96%, while the customized CRISPR3 operon provided complete resistance to bacteriophage DTL. The results indicate that the heterologous bacteriophage-resistance system described herein is useful in eliminating lytic infections of bacteriophage DTL, which was prevalent in environment surrounding the manufacturing facility.

29403013	Specialized RNA endonucleases for the maturation of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-derived RNAs (crRNAs) are critical in CRISPR-CRISPR-associated protein (Cas) defence mechanisms. The Cas6 and Cas5d enzymes are the RNA endonucleases in many class 1 CRISPR-Cas systems. In some class 2 systems, maturation and effector functions are combined within a single enzyme or maturation proceeds through the combined actions of RNase III and trans-activating CRISPR RNAs (tracrRNAs). Three separate CRISPR-Cas systems exist in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Whereas Cas6-type enzymes act in two of these systems, the third, which is classified as subtype III-B variant (III-Bv), lacks cas6 homologues. Instead, the maturation of crRNAs proceeds through the activity of endoribonuclease E, leaving unusual 13- and 14-nucleotide-long 5'-handles. Overexpression of RNase E leads to overaccumulation and knock-down to the reduced accumulation of crRNAs in vivo, suggesting that RNase E is the limiting factor for CRISPR complex formation. Recognition by RNase E depends on a stem-loop in the CRISPR repeat, whereas base substitutions at the cleavage site trigger the appearance of secondary products, consistent with a two-step recognition and cleavage mechanism. These results suggest the adaptation of an otherwise very conserved housekeeping enzyme to accommodate new substrates and illuminate the impressive plasticity of CRISPR-Cas systems that enables them to function in particular genomic environments.

29402189	Modeling disease with human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) is hindered because the impact on cell phenotype from genetic variability between individuals can be greater than from the pathogenic mutation. While "footprint-free" Cas9/CRISPR editing solves this issue, existing approaches are inefficient or lengthy. In this study, a simplified PiggyBac strategy shortened hPSC editing by 2 weeks and required one round of clonal expansion and genotyping rather than two, with similar efficiencies to the longer conventional process. Success was shown across four cardiac-associated loci (ADRB2, GRK5, RYR2, and ACTC1) by genomic cleavage and editing efficiencies of 8%-93% and 8%-67%, respectively, including mono- and/or biallelic events. Pluripotency was retained, as was differentiation into high-purity cardiomyocytes (CMs; 88%-99%). Using the GRK5 isogenic lines as an exemplar, chronic stimulation with the β-adrenoceptor agonist, isoprenaline, reduced beat rate in hPSC-CMs expressing GRK5-Q41 but not GRK5-L41; this was reversed by the β-blocker, propranolol. This shortened, footprint-free approach will be useful for mechanistic studies.	A Kondrashov|M Duc Hoang|JGW Smith|JR Bhagwan|G Duncan|D Mosqueira|MB Munoz|NTN Vo|C Denning

29394097	Although infrequently associated with reported salmonellosis in humans, Salmonella enterica, subsp. enterica serovar Kentucky (ser. Kentucky) is the most common nonclinical, nonhuman serovar reported in the United States. The goal of this study was to use Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-multi-virulence-locus sequence typing (MVLST) to subtype a collection of human clinical isolates of ser. Kentucky submitted to the Pennsylvania Department of Health and to determine the extent of antibiotic resistance in these strains. This analysis highlighted the polyphyletic nature of ser. Kentucky, and separated our isolates into two groups, Group I and Group II, which were equally represented in our collection. Furthermore, antimicrobial susceptibility testing on all isolates using a National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) panel of antibiotics demonstrated that resistance profiles could be divided into two groups. Group I isolates were resistant to cephems and penicillins, whereas Group II isolates were resistant to quinolones, gentamicin, and sulfisoxazole. Collectively, 50% of isolates were resistant to three or more classes of antibiotics and 30% were resistant to five or more classes. The correlation of antibiotic resistance with the two different lineages may reflect adaptation within two distinct reservoirs of ser. Kentucky, with differential exposure to antimicrobials.

29394047	Adaptive immunity against foreign genetic elements conferred by the CRISPR systems in microbial species has been repurposed as a revolutionary technology for wide-ranging biological applications-chiefly genome engineering. Biochemical, structural, genetic, and genomics studies have revealed important insights into their function and mechanisms, but most ensemble studies cannot observe structural changes of these molecules during their function and are often blind to key reaction intermediates. Here, we review the use of single molecule approaches such as fluorescent particle tracking, FRET, magnetic tweezers, and atomic force microscopy imaging in improving our understanding of the CRISPR toolbox.

29388938	This protocol is an extension to: Nat. Protoc. 9, 2395-2410 (2014); doi:10.1038/nprot.2014.157; published online 18 September 2014In recent years, CRISPR/Cas9 has emerged as a powerful tool for improving crop traits. Conventional plant genome editing mainly relies on plasmid-carrying cassettes delivered by Agrobacterium or particle bombardment. Here, we describe DNA-free editing of bread wheat by delivering in vitro transcripts (IVTs) or ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) of CRISPR/Cas9 by particle bombardment. This protocol serves as an extension of our previously published protocol on genome editing in bread wheat using CRISPR/Cas9 plasmids delivered by particle bombardment. The methods we describe not only eliminate random integration of CRISPR/Cas9 into genomic DNA, but also reduce off-target effects. In this protocol extension article, we present detailed protocols for preparation of IVTs and RNPs; validation by PCR/restriction enzyme (RE) and next-generation sequencing; delivery by biolistics; and recovery of mutants and identification of mutants by pooling methods and Sanger sequencing. To use these protocols, researchers should have basic skills and experience in molecular biology and biolistic transformation. By using these protocols, plants edited without the use of any foreign DNA can be generated and identified within 9-11 weeks.	Z Liang|K Chen|Y Zhang|J Liu|K Yin|JL Qiu|C Gao
29386245	CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering has revolutionised all aspects of biological research, with epigenome engineering transforming gene regulation studies. Here, we present an optimised, adaptable toolkit enabling genome and epigenome engineering in the chicken embryo, and demonstrate its utility by probing gene regulatory interactions mediated by neural crest enhancers. First, we optimise novel efficient guide-RNA mini expression vectors utilising chick U6 promoters, provide a strategy for rapid somatic gene knockout and establish a protocol for evaluation of mutational penetrance by targeted next-generation sequencing. We show that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated disruption of transcription factors causes a reduction in their cognate enhancer-driven reporter activity. Next, we assess endogenous enhancer function using both enhancer deletion and nuclease-deficient Cas9 (dCas9) effector fusions to modulate enhancer chromatin landscape, thus providing the first report of epigenome engineering in a developing embryo. Finally, we use the synergistic activation mediator (SAM) system to activate an endogenous target promoter. The novel genome and epigenome engineering toolkit developed here enables manipulation of endogenous gene expression and enhancer activity in chicken embryos, facilitating high-resolution analysis of gene regulatory interactions in vivo.

29379209	The adaptation phase of CRISPR-Cas immunity depends on the precise integration of short segments of foreign DNA (spacers) into a specific genomic location within the CRISPR locus by the Cas1-Cas2 integration complex. Although off-target spacer integration outside of canonical CRISPR arrays has been described in vitro, no evidence of non-specific integration activity has been found in vivo. Here, we show that non-canonical off-target integrations can occur within bacterial chromosomes at locations that resemble the native CRISPR locus by characterizing hundreds of off-target integration locations within Escherichia coli. Considering whether such promiscuous Cas1-Cas2 activity could have an evolutionary role through the genesis of neo-CRISPR loci, we combed existing CRISPR databases and available genomes for evidence of off-target integration activity. This search uncovered several putative instances of naturally occurring off-target spacer integration events within the genomes of Yersinia pestis and Sulfolobus islandicus. These results are important in understanding alternative routes to CRISPR array genesis and evolution, as well as in the use of spacer acquisition in technological applications.

29379029	Site-specific modification of antibodies has become a critical aspect in the development of next-generation immunoconjugates meeting criteria of clinically acceptable homogeneity, reproducibility, efficacy, ease of manufacturability, and cost-effectiveness. Using CRISPR/Cas9 genomic editing, we developed a simple and novel approach to produce site-specifically modified antibodies. A sortase tag was genetically incorporated into the C-terminal end of the third immunoglobulin heavy chain constant region (CH3) within a hybridoma cell line to manufacture antibodies capable of site-specific conjugation. This enabled an effective enzymatic site-controlled conjugation of fluorescent and radioactive cargoes to a genetically tagged mAb without impairment of antigen binding activity. After injection in mice, these immunoconjugates showed almost doubled specific targeting in the lung vs. chemically conjugated maternal mAb, and concomitant reduction in uptake in the liver and spleen. The approach outlined in this work provides a facile method for the development of more homogeneous, reproducible, effective, and scalable antibody conjugates for use as therapeutic and diagnostic tools.

29379011	Recent advances using CRISPR-Cas9 approaches have dramatically enhanced the ease for genetic manipulation in rodents. Notwithstanding, the methods to deliver nucleic acids into pre-implantation embryos have hardly changed since the original description of mouse transgenesis more than 30 years ago. Here we report a novel strategy to generate genetically modified mice by transduction of CRISPR-Cas9 components into pre-implantation mouse embryos via recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAVs). Using this approach, we efficiently generated a variety of targeted mutations in explanted embryos, including indel events produced by non-homologous end joining and tailored mutations using homology-directed repair. We also achieved gene modification in vivo by direct delivery of rAAV particles into the oviduct of pregnant females. Our approach greatly simplifies the generation of genetically modified mice and, more importantly, opens the door for streamlined gene editing in other mammalian species.

29378893	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and the CRISPR-associated proteins (Cas) provide bacteria and archaea with adaptive immunity to specific DNA invaders. Mycobacterium tuberculosis encodes a type III CRISPR-Cas system that has not been experimentally explored. In this study, we found that the CRISPR-Cas systems of both M. tuberculosis and Mycobacterium bovis BCG were highly upregulated by deletion of Rv2837c (cnpB), which encodes a multifunctional protein that hydrolyzes cyclic di-AMP (c-di-AMP), cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP), and nanoRNAs (short oligonucleotides of 5 or fewer residues). By using genetic and biochemical approaches, we demonstrated that the CnpB-controlled transcriptional regulation of the CRISPR-Cas system is mediated by an Orn-like activity rather than by hydrolyzing the cyclic dinucleotides. Additionally, our results revealed that tuberculosis (TB) complex mycobacteria are functional in processing CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs), which are also more abundant in the ΔcnpB strain than in the parent strain. The elevated crRNA levels in the ΔcnpB strain could be partially reduced by expressing Escherichia coli orn Our findings provide new insight into transcriptional regulation of bacterial CRISPR-Cas systems.IMPORTANCE Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and the CRISPR-associated proteins (Cas) provide adaptive immunity to specific DNA invaders.

29377933	Preparing the genetically modified organisms have required much time and labor, making it the rate-limiting step but CRISPR/Cas9 technology appearance has changed this difficulty. Although reports on CRISPR/Cas9 technology such as genome editing and CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) in eukaryotes increased, those in prokaryotes especially in Staphylococci were limited. Thus, its potential in the bacteriology remains unexplored. This is attributed to ecological difference between eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Here, we constructed a novel CRISPRi plasmid vector, pBACi for Staphylococcus aureus. The transformation efficiency of S. aureus was ~104 CFU/μg DNA using a vector extracted from dcm negative, which encoded one of DNA modification genes, E. coli. Further, pBACi was introduced into various clinical isolates including that not accepting the conventional temperature-sensitive vector. dcas9 in the vector was expressed throughout the growth phases of S. aureus and this vector decreased various gene mRNA expressions based on the crRNA targeting sequences and altered the knockdown strains' phenotypes. The targeted genes included various virulence and antibiotic resistant genes. Bioinformatics suggest this vector can be introduced into wide range of low-GC Gram-positive bacteria. Because this new CRISPR/Cas9-based vector can easily prepare knockdown strains, we believe the novel vector will facilitate the characterization of the function of genes from S. aureus and other Gram-positive bacteria.

29362972	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) is poised to become one of the key scientific discoveries of the twenty-first century. Originating from prokaryotic and archaeal immune systems to counter phage invasions, CRISPR-based applications have been tailored for manipulating a broad range of living organisms. From the different elucidated types of CRISPR mechanisms, the type II system adapted from Streptococcus pyogenes has been the most exploited as a tool for genome engineering and gene regulation.

29358495	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas systems are well-known acquired immunity systems that are widespread in archaea and bacteria. The RNA-guided nucleases from CRISPR-Cas systems are currently regarded as the most reliable tools for genome editing and engineering. The first hint of their existence came in 1987, when an unusual repetitive DNA sequence, which subsequently was defined as a CRISPR, was discovered in the Escherichia coli genome during an analysis of genes involved in phosphate metabolism. Similar sequence patterns were then reported in a range of other bacteria as well as in halophilic archaea, suggesting an important role for such evolutionarily conserved clusters of repeated sequences. A critical step toward functional characterization of the CRISPR-Cas systems was the recognition of a link between CRISPRs and the associated Cas proteins, which were initially hypothesized to be involved in DNA repair in hyperthermophilic archaea. Comparative genomics, structural biology, and advanced biochemistry could then work hand in hand, not only culminating in the explosion of genome editing tools based on CRISPR-Cas9 and other class II CRISPR-Cas systems but also providing insights into the origin and evolution of this system from mobile genetic elements denoted casposons. To celebrate the 30th anniversary of the discovery of CRISPR, this minireview briefly discusses the fascinating history of CRISPR-Cas systems, from the original observation of an enigmatic sequence in E. coli to genome editing in humans.

29358217	The renin-angiotensin system plays an essential role in blood pressure homeostasis. Because renin activity is reflected as a blood pressure phenotype, its gene expression in the kidney is tightly regulated by a feedback mechanism; i.e., renin gene transcription is suppressed in a hypertensive state. To address the molecular mechanisms controlling hypertension-responsive mouse renin (mRen) gene regulation, we deleted either 5' (17-kb) or 3' (78-kb) regions of the endogenous mRen gene and placed the animals in a hypertensive environment. While the mRen gene bearing the 3' deletion was appropriately downregulated, the one bearing the 5' deletion lost this hypertension responsiveness. Because the 17-kb sequence exhibited enhancer activity in vivo and in vitro, we narrowed down the enhancer to a 2.3-kb core using luciferase assays in As4.1 cells. When this 2.3-kb sequence was removed from the endogenous mRen gene in the mouse, its basal expression was dramatically reduced, and the hypertension responsiveness was significantly attenuated. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the angiotensin II signal played an important role in mRen gene suppression. We propose that in a hypertensive environment, the activity of this novel enhancer is attenuated, and, as a consequence, mRen gene transcription is suppressed to maintain blood pressure.

29358044	Generation of induced pluripotent stem cells typically requires the ectopic expression of transcription factors to reactivate the pluripotency network. However, it remains largely unclear what remodeling events on endogenous chromatin trigger reprogramming toward induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Toward this end, we employed CRISPR activation to precisely target and remodel endogenous gene loci of Oct4 and Sox2. Interestingly, we found that single-locus targeting of Sox2 was sufficient to remodel and activate Sox2, which was followed by the induction of other pluripotent genes and establishment of the pluripotency network. Simultaneous remodeling of the Oct4 promoter and enhancer also triggered reprogramming. Authentic pluripotent cell lines were established in both cases. Finally, we showed that targeted manipulation of histone acetylation at the Oct4 gene locus could also initiate reprogramming. Our study generated authentic iPSCs with CRISPR activation through precise epigenetic remodeling of endogenous loci and shed light on how targeted chromatin remodeling triggers pluripotency induction.

29352001	Oxidant stress modifies T lymphocyte activation and function. Previous work demonstrated that murine T cell-specific kelch like-ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) deletion enhances antioxidant capacity and protects from experimental acute kidney injury. In this study, we used CRISPR technology to develop clinically translatable human T cell-specific KEAP1 deletion. Delivery of KEAP1 exon 2 specific Cas9:guide RNA in Jurkat T cells led to significant (∼70%) editing and upregulation of NRF2-regulated antioxidant genes NADPH dehydrogenase quinone 1 (NQO1) (up to 11-fold), heme oxygenase 1 (HO1) (up to 11-fold), and GCLM (up to 2-fold). In primary human T cells, delivery of KEAP1 exon 2 target site 2-specific ATTO 550-labeled Cas9:guide RNA edited KEAP1 in ∼40% cells and significantly (p ≤ 0.04) increased NQO1 (16-fold), HO1 (9-fold), and GCLM (2-fold) expression. To further enrich KEAP1-edited cells, ATTO 550-positive cells were sorted 24 h after electroporation. Assessment of ATTO 550-positive cells showed KEAP1 editing in ∼55% cells. There was no detectable off-target cleavage in the top three predicted genes in the ATTO 550-positive cells. Gene expression analysis found significantly (p ≤ 0.01) higher expression of NQO1 mRNA in ATTO 550-positive cells compared with control cells. Flow cytometric assessment showed increased (p ≤ 0.01) frequency of CD4-, CD25-, and CD69-expressing KEAP1 edited cells whereas frequency of CD8- (p ≤ 0.01) and IL-17- (p ≤ 0.05) expressing cells was reduced compared with control cells. Similar experimental conditions resulted in significant KEAP1 editing, increased antioxidant gene expression, and frequency of CD69 and IL-10 positive cells in highly enriched KEAP1-edited regulatory T cells. KEAP1-edited T cells could potentially be used for treating multiple human diseases.	S Noel|SA Lee|M Sadasivam|ARA Hamad|H Rabb

29348170	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins provide microbial adaptive immunity against bacteriophages. In type I-F CRISPR-Cas systems, multiple Cas proteins (Csy1-4) compose a surveillance complex (Csy complex) with CRISPR RNA (crRNA) for target recognition. Here, we report the biochemical characterization of the Csy1-Csy2 subcomplex from Xanthomonas albilineans, including the analysis of its interaction with crRNA and AcrF2, an anti-CRISPR (Acr) protein from a phage that infects Pseudomonas aeruginosa The X. albilineans Csy1 and Csy2 proteins (XaCsy1 and XaCsy2, respectively) formed a stable heterodimeric complex that specifically bound the 8-nucleotide (nt) 5'-handle of the crRNA. In contrast, the XaCsy1-XaCsy2 heterodimer exhibited reduced affinity for the 28-nt X. albilineans CRISPR repeat RNA containing the 5'-handle sequence. Chromatographic and calorimetric analyses revealed tight binding between the Acr protein from the P. aeruginosa phage and the heterodimeric subunit of the X. albilineans Csy complex, suggesting that AcrF2 recognizes conserved features of Csy1-Csy2 heterodimers. We found that neither XaCsy1 nor XaCsy2 alone forms a stable complex with AcrF2 and the 5'-handle RNA, indicating that XaCsy1-XaCsy2 heterodimerization is required for binding them. We also solved the crystal structure of AcrF2 to a resolution of 1.34 Å, enabling a more detailed structural analysis of the residues involved in the interactions with the Csy1-Csy2 heterodimer. Our results provide information about the order of events during the formation of the multisubunit crRNA-guided surveillance complex and suggest that the Acr protein inactivating type I-F CRISPR-Cas systems has broad specificity.

29348144	Oriented cell divisions are critical to establish and maintain cell fates and tissue organization. Diverse extracellular and intracellular cues have been shown to provide spatial information for mitotic spindle positioning; however, the molecular mechanisms by which extracellular signals communicate with cells to direct mitotic spindle positioning are largely unknown. In animal cells, oriented cell divisions are often achieved by the localization of force-generating motor protein complexes to discrete cortical domains. Disrupting either these force-generating complexes or proteins that globally affect microtubule stability results in defects in mitotic positioning, irrespective of whether these proteins function as spatial cues for spindle orientation. This poses a challenge to traditional genetic dissection of this process. Therefore, as an alternative strategy to identify key proteins that act downstream of intercellular signaling, we screened the localization of many candidate proteins by inserting fluorescent tags directly into endogenous gene loci, without overexpressing the proteins. We tagged 23 candidate proteins in Caenorhabditis elegans and examined each protein's localization in a well-characterized, oriented cell division in the four-cell-stage embryo. We used cell manipulations and genetic experiments to determine which cells harbor key localized proteins and which signals direct these localizations in vivo We found that Dishevelled and adenomatous polyposis coli homologs are polarized during this oriented cell division in response to a Wnt signal, but two proteins typically associated with mitotic spindle positioning, homologs of NuMA and Dynein, were not detectably polarized. These results suggest an unexpected mechanism for mitotic spindle positioning in this system, they pinpoint key proteins of interest, and they highlight the utility of a screening approach based on analyzing the localization of endogenously tagged proteins.

29344676	The idea of using the effector immune cells to specifically fight cancer has recently evolved into an exciting concept of adoptive cell therapies. Indeed, genetically engineered T cells expressing on their surface recombinant, cancer-targeted receptors have been shown to induce promising response in oncological patients. However, in addition to exogenous expression of such receptors, there is also a need for disruption of certain genes in the immune cells to achieve more potent disease-targeted actions, to produce universal chimeric antigen receptor-based therapies or to study the signaling pathways in detail. In this review, we present novel genetic engineering methods, mainly TALEN and CRISPR/Cas9 systems, that can be used for such purposes. These unique techniques may contribute to creating more successful immune therapies against cancer or prospectively other diseases as well.	AO Zych|M Bajor|R Zagozdzon
29343869	Imaging and chromatin capture techniques have provided important insights into our understanding of nuclear organization. A limitation of these techniques is the inability to resolve allele-specific spatiotemporal properties of genomic loci in living cells. Here, we describe an allele-specific CRISPR live-cell DNA imaging technique (SNP-CLING) to provide the first comprehensive insights into allelic positioning across space and time in mouse embryonic stem cells and fibroblasts. With 3D imaging, we studied alleles on different chromosomes in relation to one another and relative to nuclear substructures such as the nucleolus. We find that alleles maintain similar positions relative to each other and the nucleolus; however, loci occupy unique positions. To monitor spatiotemporal dynamics by SNP-CLING, we performed 4D imaging and determined that alleles are either stably positioned or fluctuating during cell state transitions, such as apoptosis. SNP-CLING is a universally applicable technique that enables the dissection of allele-specific spatiotemporal genome organization in live cells.

29343825	The T7 endonuclease 1 (T7E1) mismatch detection assay is a widely used method for evaluating the activity of site-specific nucleases, such as the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 system. To determine the accuracy and sensitivity of this assay, we compared the editing estimates derived by the T7E1 assay with that of targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) in pools of edited mammalian cells. Here, we report that estimates of nuclease activity determined by T7E1 most often do not accurately reflect the activity observed in edited cells. Editing efficiencies of CRISPR-Cas9 complexes with similar activity by T7E1 can prove dramatically different by NGS. Additionally, we compared editing efficiencies predicted by the Tracking of Indels by Decomposition (TIDE) assay and the Indel Detection by Amplicon Analysis (IDAA) assay to that observed by targeted NGS for both cellular pools and single-cell derived clones. We show that targeted NGS, TIDE, and IDAA assays predict similar editing efficiencies for pools of cells but that TIDE and IDAA can miscall alleles in edited clones.

29339820	Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) is a biological program that plays key roles in various developmental and pathological processes. Although much work has been done on signaling pathways and transcription factors regulating EMT, the epigenetic regulation of EMT remains not well understood. Histone variants have been recognized as a key group of epigenetic regulators. Among them, macroH2A1 is involved in stem cell reprogramming and cancer progression. We postulated that macroH2A1 may play a role in EMT, a process involving reprogramming of cellular states. In this study, we demonstrate that expression of macroH2A1 is dramatically reduced during EMT induction in immortalized human mammary epithelial cells (HMLE). Moreover, ectopic expression of the macroH2A1.1 isoform, but not macroH2A1.2, can suppress EMT induction and reduce the stem-like cell population in HMLE. Interestingly, macroH2A1.1 overexpression cannot revert stable mesenchymal cells back to the epithelial state, suggesting a stage-specific role of macroH2A1.1 in EMT. We further pinpointed that the function of macroH2A1.1 in EMT suppression is dependent on its ability to bind the NAD+ metabolite PAR, in agreement with the inability to suppress EMT by macroH2A1.2, which lacks the PAR binding domain. Thus, our work discovered a previously unrecognized isoform-specific function of macroH2A1 in regulating EMT induction.	DQ Hodge|J Cui|MJ Gamble|W Guo
29339069	The CRISPR/Cas9 system is a highly efficient and convenient genome editing tool, which has been widely used for single or multiple gene mutation in a variety of organisms. Disruption of multiple homologous genes, which have similar DNA sequences and gene function, is required for the study of the desired phenotype. In this study, to test whether the CRISPR/Cas9 system works on the mutation of multiple homologous genes, a single guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting three fucosyltransferases encoding genes (FUT1, FUT2 and SEC1) was designed. As expected, triple gene mutation of FUT1, FUT2 and SEC1 could be achieved simultaneously via a sgRNA mediated CRISPR/Cas9 system. Besides, significantly reduced serum fucosyltransferases enzymes activity was also determined in those triple gene mutation rabbits. Thus, we provide the first evidence that multiple homologous genes knockout (KO) could be achieved efficiently by a sgRNA mediated CRISPR/Cas9 system in mammals, which could facilitate the genotype to phenotype studies of homologous genes in future.

29337376	Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) efficiently transforms primary human B cells into immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), which are extensively used in human genetic, immunological and virological studies. LCLs provide unlimited sources of DNA for genetic investigation, but can be difficult to manipulate, for instance because low retroviral or lentiviral transduction frequencies hinder experiments that require co-expression of multiple components. This unit details Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 engineering for robust LCL genome editing. We describe the generation and delivery of single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs), or dual-targeting sgRNAs, via lentiviral transduction of LCLs that stably express Cas9 protein. CRISPR/Cas9 editing allows LCL loss-of-function studies, including knock-out of protein-coding genes or deletion of DNA regulatory elements, and can be adapted for large-scale screening approaches. Low transfection efficiencies are a second barrier to performing CRISPR editing in LCLs, which are not typically lipid-transfectable. To circumvent this barrier, we provide an optimized protocol for LCL nucleofection of Cas9/sgRNA ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) as an alternative route to achieve genome editing in LCLs. These editing approaches can also be employed in other B-cell lines, including Burkitt lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cells, and are highly reproducible. © 2018 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

29337374	Pooled cell-based screens of mammalian genetic perturbations enable systematic large-scale, even genome-scale, evaluation of gene function. Pooled screens introduce genetic perturbations into a cell population through viral transduction such that each cell integrates into its DNA a single or small number of library perturbations with barcodes identifying the perturbations. One then selects and physically isolates the subset of cells that exhibit the phenotype of interest. Sequencing the barcodes in the hit cells reveals which genes favored or inhibited the hit phenotype. Various genetic perturbations are possible, including CRISPR gene knockout, ectopic gene expression, and RNA interference. Regardless of the type of library being screened or the type of cell model being tested, such screens involve many common steps and procedures. This unit describes detailed experimental protocols for the key steps, and also highlights some of the key factors to achieving a well-powered, reproducible screen result. © 2018 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

29337372	The emergence of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-Cas9 (CRISPR-Cas9) gene editing systems has enabled the creation of specific mutants at low cost, in a short time and with high efficiency, in eukaryotic cells. Since a CRISPR-Cas9 system typically creates an array of mutations in targeted sites, a successful gene editing project requires careful selection of edited clones. This process can be very challenging, especially when working with multiallelic genes and/or polyploid cells (such as cancer and plants cells). Here we described a next-generation sequencing method called CRISPR-Cas9 Edited Site Sequencing (CRES-Seq) for the efficient and high-throughput screening of CRISPR-Cas9-edited clones. CRES-Seq facilitates the precise genotyping up to 96 CRISPR-Cas9-edited sites (CRES) in a single MiniSeq (Illumina) run with an approximate sequencing cost of $6/clone. CRES-Seq is particularly useful when multiple genes are simultaneously targeted by CRISPR-Cas9, and also for screening of clones generated from multiallelic genes/polyploid cells. © 2018 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

29337370	Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transforms small resting primary B cells into large lymphoblastoid cells which are able to grow and survive in vitro indefinitely. These cells represent a model for oncogenesis. In this unit, variants of conventional clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR), namely the CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) and CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) methods, are discussed in the context of gene regulation at genomic DNA promoter and enhancer elements. Lymphoblastoid B cell lines (LCLs) stably expressing nuclease-deficient Cas9 (dCas9)-VP64 (Cas9 associated with CRISPRa) or dCas9-KRAB (Cas9 associated with CRISPRi) are transduced with lentivirus that encodes a single guide RNA (sgRNA) that targets a specific gene locus. The ribonucleoprotein complex formed by the dCas9 molecule and its cognate sgRNA enables sequence-specific binding at a promoter or enhancer of interest to affect the expression of genes regulated by the targeted promoter or enhancer. © 2018 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

29331085	Transcription factors (TFs) and chromatin-modifying factors (CMFs) access chromatin by recognizing specific DNA motifs in their target genes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by next-generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) has been widely used to discover the potential DNA-binding motifs for both TFs and CMFs. Yet, an in vivo method for verifying DNA motifs captured by ChIP-seq is lacking in plants. Here, we describe the use of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated 9 (Cas9) to verify DNA motifs in their native genomic context in Arabidopsis. Using a single-guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting the DNA motif bound by REF6, a DNA sequence-specific H3K27 demethylase in plants, we generated stable transgenic plants where the motif was disrupted in a REF6 target gene. We also deleted a cluster of multiple motifs from another REF6 target gene using a pair of sgRNAs, targeting upstream and downstream regions of the cluster, respectively. We demonstrated that endogenous genes with motifs disrupted and/or deleted become inaccessible to REF6. This strategy should be widely applicable for in vivo verification of DNA motifs identified by ChIP-seq in plants.	C Li|C Chen|H Chen|S Wang|X Chen|Y Cui

29326075	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat/CRISPR-associated 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) enables targeted genome engineering. The simplicity of this system, its facile engineering, and amenability to multiplex genes make it the system of choice for many applications. This system has revolutionized our ability to carry out gene editing, transcription regulation, genome imaging, and epigenetic modification. In this review, we discuss the discovery of CRISPR/Cas9, its mechanism of action, its application in medicine and animal model development, and its delivery. We also highlight how the CRISPR/Cas9 system can affect the next generation of drugs by accelerating the identification and validation of high-value targets. The generation of precision disease models through this system will provide a rapid avenue for functional drug screening.	G Ahmad|M Amiji
29323662	Apicomplexan parasites, such as Toxoplasma gondii, cause extensive morbidity and mortality in humans and livestock, highlighting the need for a deeper understanding of their molecular biology. Although techniques for the generation of targeted gene disruptions have long been available for apicomplexans, such methods are not readily scalable to the entire genome. We recently used CRISPR-Cas9 to disrupt all nuclear protein-coding genes in T. gondii using a pooled format. The method relies on transfection of a guide RNA library into parasites constitutively expressing Cas9. Here, we present the complete workflow of such a screen, including preparation of the guide RNA library, growth and testing of the recipient strain, generation of the mutant population, culture conditions for the screen, preparation of genomic DNA libraries, next-generation sequencing of the guide RNA loci, and analysis to detect fitness-conferring genes. This method can be deployed to study how culture conditions affect the repertoire of genes needed by parasites, which will enable studies of their metabolic needs, host specificity, and drug-resistance mechanisms. In addition, by manipulating the background in which the screen is performed, researchers will be able to investigate genetic interactions, which may help uncover redundancy or epistasis in the parasite genome. Using this method, a genome-wide screen and its analysis can be completed in 3 weeks, after ∼1 month of preparation to generate the library and grow the cells needed, making it a powerful tool for uncovering functionally important genes in apicomplexan parasites.

29316926	The construction of microbial cell factories requires cost-effective and rapid strain development through metabolic engineering. Recently, RNA-guided CRISPR technologies have been developed for metabolic engineering of industrially-relevant host.	To demonstrate the application of the CRISPR interference (CRISPRi), we developed two-plasmid CRISPRi vectors and applied the CRISPRi in Corynebacterium glutamicum to repress single target genes and double target genes simultaneously. Four-different single genes (the pyc, gltA, idsA, and glgC genes) repressions were successfully performed using the CRISPRi vectors, resulting significant mRNA reductions of the targets compared to a control. Subsequently, the phenotypes for the target gene-repressed strains were analyzed, showing the expected cell growth behaviors with different carbon sources. In addition, double gene repression (the idsA and glgC genes in a different order) by the CRISPRi resulted in an independent gene repression to each target gene simultaneously. To demonstrate an industrial application of the CRISPRi, citrate synthase (CS)-targeting DM1919 (L-lysine producer) strains with a sgRNA-gltA-r showed reduced CS activity, resulting in the improvement of L-lysine yield by 1.39-fold than the parental DM1919 (a lysine producer).	Single or double gene repression were successfully performed using the CRISPRi vectors and sequence specific sgRNAs. The CRISPRi can be applied for multiplex metabolic engineering to enhanced lysine production and it will promote the further rapid development of microbial cell factories of C. glutamicum.

29316283	The discovery that the bacterial CRISPR/Cas9 system can be translated into mammalian cells continues to have an unprecedented impact on the biomedical research community, as it largely facilitates efforts to experimentally interrogate or therapeutically modify the cellular genome. In particular, CRISPR promises the ability to correct disease-associated genetic defects, or to target and destroy invading foreign DNA, in a simple, efficient, and selective manner directly in affected human cells or tissues. Here, we highlight a set of exciting new strategies that aim at further increasing the therapeutic index of CRISPR technologies, by reducing the size of Cas9 expression cassettes and thus enhancing their compatibility with viral gene delivery vectors. Specifically, we discuss the concept of splitCas9 whereby the Cas9 holo-protein is segregated into two parts that are expressed individually and reunited in the cell by various means, including use of 1) the gRNA as a scaffold for Cas9 assembly; 2) the rapamycin-controlled FKBP/FRB system; 3) the light-regulated Magnet system; or 4) inteins. We describe how these avenues, despite pursuing the identical aim, differ in critical features comprising the extent of spatio-temporal control of CRISPR activity, and discuss additional improvements to their efficiency or specificity that should foster their clinical translation.

29311279	Pseudomonas spp. are widely used model organisms in different areas of research. Despite the relevance of Pseudomonas in many applications, the use of protein depletion tools in this host remains limited. Here, we developed the CRISPR interference system for gene repression in Pseudomonas spp. using a nuclease-null Streptococcus pasteurianus Cas9 variant (dead Cas9, or dCas9). We demonstrate a robust and titratable gene depletion system with up to 100-fold repression in β-galactosidase activity in P. aeruginosa and 300-fold repression in pyoverdine production in Pseudomonas putida This inducible system enables the study of essential genes, as shown by ftsZ depletions in P. aeruginosa, P. putida, and Pseudomonas fluorescens that led to phenotypic changes consistent with depletion of the targeted gene. Additionally, we performed the first in vivo characterization of protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) site preferences of S. pasteurianus dCas9 and identified NNGCGA as a functional PAM site that resulted in repression efficiencies comparable to the consensus NNGTGA sequence. This discovery significantly expands the potential genomic targets of S. pasteurianus dCas9, especially in GC-rich organisms.IMPORTANCEPseudomonas spp. are prevalent in a variety of environments, such as the soil, on the surface of plants, and in the human body. Although Pseudomonas spp. are widely used as model organisms in different areas of research, existing tools to deplete a protein of interest in these organisms remain limited. We have developed a robust and inducible gene repression tool in P. aeruginosa, P. putida, and P. fluorescens using the Streptococcus pasteurianus dCas9. This method of protein depletion is superior to existing methods, such as promoter replacements and addition of degradation tags, because it does not involve genomic modifications of the target protein, is titratable, and is capable of repressing multiple genes simultaneously. This gene repression system now enables easy depletion of specific proteins in Pseudomonas, accelerating the study and engineering of this widely used model organism.	SZ Tan|CR Reisch|KLJ Prather
29304336	CRISPR-Cas9 has been touted for therapeutic genome editing, but limitations include inefficient correction of disease-causing mutations and off-target mutagenesis. In the latest issue of Cell, Liao et al. (2017) show that a modified version of CRISPR-Cas9 can target and activate key therapeutic genes in vivo without altering DNA sequence identity.

29304331	CRISPR-Cas systems offer versatile technologies for genome engineering, yet their implementation has been outpaced by ongoing discoveries of new Cas nucleases and anti-CRISPR proteins. Here, we present the use of E. coli cell-free transcription-translation (TXTL) systems to vastly improve the speed and scalability of CRISPR characterization and validation. TXTL can express active CRISPR machinery from added plasmids and linear DNA, and TXTL can output quantitative dynamics of DNA cleavage and gene repression-all without protein purification or live cells. We used TXTL to measure the dynamics of DNA cleavage and gene repression for single- and multi-effector CRISPR nucleases, predict gene repression strength in E. coli, determine the specificities of 24 diverse anti-CRISPR proteins, and develop a fast and scalable screen for protospacer-adjacent motifs that was successfully applied to five uncharacterized Cpf1 nucleases. These examples underscore how TXTL can facilitate the characterization and application of CRISPR technologies across their many uses.

29303510	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a deadly malignancy with limited treatment options. Activation of the AKT/mTOR cascade is one of the most frequent events along hepatocarcinogenesis. mTOR is a serine/threonine kinase and presents in two distinct complexes: mTORC1 and mTORC2. While mTORC1 has been extensively studied in HCC, the functional contribution of mTORC2 during hepatocarcinogenesis has not been well characterized, especially in vivo. Pten expression is one of the major mechanisms leading to the aberrant activation of the AKT/mTOR signaling. Here, we show that concomitant downregulation of Pten and upregulation of c-Met occurs in a subset of human HCC, mainly characterized by poor prognosis. Using CRISPR-based gene editing in combination with hydrodynamic injection, Pten was deleted in a subset of mouse hepatocytes (sgPten). We found that loss of Pten synergizes with overexpression of c-Met to promote HCC development in mice (sgPten/c-Met). At the molecular level, sgPten/c-Met liver tumor tissues display increased AKT and mTOR signaling. Using Rictor conditional knockout mice, we demonstrate that sgPten/c-Met-driven HCC development strictly depends on an intact mTORC2 complex. Our findings therefore support the critical role of mTORC2 in hepatocarcinogenesis. sgPten/c-Met mouse model represents a novel valuable system that can be used for the development of targeted therapy against this deadly malignancy.

29303478	Double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) binding and cleavage by Cas9 is a hallmark of type II CRISPR-Cas bacterial adaptive immunity. All known Cas9 enzymes are thought to recognize DNA exclusively as a natural substrate, providing protection against DNA phage and plasmids. Here, we show that Cas9 enzymes from both subtypes II-A and II-C can recognize and cleave single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) by an RNA-guided mechanism that is independent of a protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) sequence in the target RNA. RNA-guided RNA cleavage is programmable and site-specific, and we find that this activity can be exploited to reduce infection by single-stranded RNA phage in vivo. We also demonstrate that Cas9 can direct PAM-independent repression of gene expression in bacteria. These results indicate that a subset of Cas9 enzymes have the ability to act on both DNA and RNA target sequences, and suggest the potential for use in programmable RNA targeting applications.

29298051	We present here an integrated nanotechnology/biology strategy for cancer immunotherapy that uses arginine nanoparticles (ArgNPs) to deliver CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing machinery into cells to generate SIRP-α knockout macrophages. The NP system efficiently codelivers single guide RNA (sgRNA) and Cas9 protein required for editing to knock out the "don't eat me signal" in macrophages that prevents phagocytosis of cancer cells. Turning off this signal increased the innate phagocytic capabilities of the macrophages by 4-fold. This improved attack and elimination of cancer cells makes this strategy promising for the creation of "weaponized" macrophages for cancer immunotherapy.

29295818	The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 system has been proven to be an efficient and precise genome editing technology in various organisms. However, the gene editing efficiencies of Cas9 proteins with a nuclear localization signal (NLS) fused to different termini and Cas9 mRNA have not been systematically compared. Here, we compared the ability of Cas9 proteins with NLS fused to the N-, C-, or both the N- and C-termini and N-NLS-Cas9-NLS-C mRNA to target two sites in the tyr gene and two sites in the gol gene related to pigmentation in zebrafish. Phenotypic analysis revealed that all types of Cas9 led to hypopigmentation in similar proportions of injected embryos. Genome analysis by T7 Endonuclease I (T7E1) assays demonstrated that all types of Cas9 similarly induced mutagenesis in four target sites. Sequencing results further confirmed that a high frequency of indels occurred in the target sites (tyr1 > 66%, tyr2 > 73%, gol1 > 50%, and gol2 > 35%), as well as various types (more than six) of indel mutations observed in all four types of Cas9-injected embryos. Furthermore, all types of Cas9 showed efficient targeted mutagenesis on multiplex genome editing, resulting in multiple phenotypes simultaneously. Collectively, we conclude that various NLS-fused Cas9 proteins and Cas9 mRNAs have similar genome editing efficiencies on targeting single or multiple genes, suggesting that the efficiency of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing is highly dependent on guide RNAs (gRNAs) and gene loci. These findings may help to simplify the selection of Cas9 for gene editing using the CRISPR/Cas9 system.	P Hu|X Zhao|Q Zhang|W Li|Y Zu
29293625	Regulation of the cytoskeleton is essential for cell migration in health and disease. Lymphocyte cytosolic protein 1 (lcp1, also called L-plastin) is a hematopoietic-specific actin-bundling protein that is highly conserved in zebrafish, mice and humans. In addition, L-plastin expression is documented as both a genetic marker and a cellular mechanism contributing to the invasiveness of tumors and transformed cell lines. Despite L-plastin's role in both immunity and cancer, in zebrafish there are no direct studies of its function, and no mutant, knockout or reporter lines available. Using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, we generated null alleles of zebrafish lcp1 and examined the phenotypes of these fish throughout the life cycle. Our editing strategy used gRNA to target the second exon of lcp1, producing F0 mosaic fish that were outcrossed to wild types to confirm germline transmission. F1 heterozygotes were then sequenced to identify three unique null alleles, here called 'Charlie', 'Foxtrot' and 'Lima'. In silico, each allele truncates the endogenous protein to less than 5% normal size and removes both essential actin-binding domains (ABD1 and ABD2). Although none of the null lines express detectable LCP1 protein, homozygous mutant zebrafish (-/-) can develop and reproduce normally, a finding consistent with that of the L-plastin null mouse (LPL -/-). However, such mice do have a profound immune defect when challenged by lung bacteria. Interestingly, we observed reduced long-term survival of zebrafish lcp1 -/- homozygotes (~30% below the expected numbers) in all three of our knockout lines, with greatest mortality corresponding to the period (4-6 weeks post-fertilization) when the innate immune system is functional, but the adaptive immune system is not yet mature. This suggests that null zebrafish may have reduced capacity to combat opportunistic infections, which are more easily transmissible in the aquatic environment. Overall, our novel mutant lines establish a sound genetic model and an enhanced platform for further studies of L-plastin gene function in hematopoiesis and cancer.

29290584	To uncover regulatory mechanisms in Hedgehog (Hh) signaling, we conducted genome-wide screens to identify positive and negative pathway components and validated top hits using multiple signaling and differentiation assays in two different cell types. Most positive regulators identified in our screens, including Rab34, Pdcl, and Tubd1, were involved in ciliary functions, confirming the central role for primary cilia in Hh signaling. Negative regulators identified included Megf8, Mgrn1, and an unannotated gene encoding a tetraspan protein we named Atthog. The function of these negative regulators converged on Smoothened (SMO), an oncoprotein that transduces the Hh signal across the membrane. In the absence of Atthog, SMO was stabilized at the cell surface and concentrated in the ciliary membrane, boosting cell sensitivity to the ligand Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) and consequently altering SHH-guided neural cell-fate decisions. Thus, we uncovered genes that modify the interpretation of morphogen signals by regulating protein-trafficking events in target cells.

29285825	Congenital malformations affecting the neural tube can present as isolated malformations or occur in association with other developmental abnormalities and syndromes. Using high-resolution copy number screening in 66 fetuses with neural tube defects, we identified six fetuses with likely pathogenic mutations, three aneuploidies (one trisomy 13 and two trisomy 18) and three deletions previously reported in NTDs (one 22q11.2 deletion and two 1p36 deletions) corresponding to 9% of the cohort. In addition, we identified five rare deletions and two duplications of uncertain significance including a rare intragenic heterozygous in-frame WDR63 deletion in a fetus with occipital encephalocele. Whole genome sequencing verified the deletion and excluded known pathogenic variants. The deletion spans exons 14-17 resulting in the expression of a protein missing the third and fourth WD-repeat domains. These findings were supported by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated somatic deletions in zebrafish. Injection of two different sgRNA-pairs targeting relevant intronic regions resulted in a deletion mimicking the human deletion and a concomitant increase of abnormal embryos with body and brain malformations (41%, n = 161 and 62%, n = 224, respectively), including a sac-like brain protrusion (7% and 9%, P < 0.01). Similar results were seen with overexpression of RNA encoding the deleted variant in zebrafish (total abnormal; 46%, n = 255, P < 0.001) compared with the overexpression of an equivalent amount of wild-type RNA (total abnormal; 3%, n = 177). We predict the in-frame WDR63 deletion to result in a dominant negative or gain-of-function form of WDR63. These are the first findings supporting a role for WDR63 in encephalocele formation.

29282799	What is the topic of this review? This review summarizes the development of gene editing from early proof-of-concept studies in the 1980s to contemporary programmable and RNA-guided nucleases, which enable rapid and precise alteration of DNA sequences of almost any living cell. What advances does it highlight? With an average of one clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) Cas9 paper published every 4 h in 2017, this review cannot highlight all new developments, but a number of key improvements, including increases in efficiency, a range of new options to reduce off-target effects and plans for CRISPR to enter clinical trials in 2018, are discussed.	Genome editing enables precise changes to be made in the genome of living cells. The technique was originally developed in the 1980s but largely limited to use in mice. The discovery that a targeted double-stranded break at a unique site in the genome, close to the site to be changed, could substantially increase the efficiency of editing raised the possibility of using the technique in a broader range of animal models and, potentially, human cells. But the challenge was to identify reagents that could create targeted breaks at a unique genomic location with minimal off-target effects. In 2005, the demonstration that programmable zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) could perform this task led to a number of proof-of-concept studies, but a limitation was the ease with which effective ZFNs could be produced. In 2009, the development of TAL effector nucleases (TALENs) increased the specificity of gene editing and the ease of design and production. However, it was not until 2013 and the development of the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) Cas9/guide RNA that gene editing became a research tool that any laboratory could use.

29281822	CRISPR-Cas systems defend bacteria and archaea against infection by bacteriophage and other threats. The central component of these systems are surveillance complexes that use guide RNAs to bind specific regions of foreign nucleic acids, marking them for destruction. Surveillance complexes must locate targets rapidly to ensure timely immune response, but the mechanism of this search process remains unclear. Here, we used single-molecule FRET to visualize how the type I-E surveillance complex Cascade searches DNA in real time. Cascade rapidly and randomly samples DNA through nonspecific electrostatic contacts, pausing at short PAM recognition sites that may be adjacent to the target. We identify Cascade motifs that are essential for either nonspecific sampling or positioning and readout of the PAM. Our findings provide a comprehensive structural and kinetic model for the Cascade target-search mechanism, revealing how CRISPR surveillance complexes can rapidly search large amounts of genetic material en route to target recognition.

29268281	Oncogenic human papillomaviruses (HPVs) cause different types of cancer especially cervical cancer. HPV-associated carcinogenesis provides a classical model system for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR/Cas9) based cancer therapies since the viral oncogenes E6 and E7 are exclusively expressed in cancerous cells. Sequence-specific gene knockdown/knockout using CRISPR/Cas9 shows promise as a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of a variety of diseases that currently lack effective treatments. However, CRISPR/Cas9-based targeting therapy requires further validation of its efficacy in vitro and in vivo to eliminate the potential off-target effects, necessitates verification of the delivery vehicles and the combinatory use of conventional therapies with CRISPR/Cas9 to ensure the feasibility and safety. In this review we discuss the potential of combining CRISPR/Cas9 with other treatment options as therapies for oncogenic HPVs-associated carcinogenesis. and present our assessment of the promising path to the development of CRISPR/Cas9 therapeutic strategies for clinical settings.

29267886	Genome editing with the CRISPR-Cas9 system has enabled unprecedented efficacy for reverse genetics and gene correction approaches. While off-target effects have been successfully tackled, the effort to eliminate variability in sgRNA efficacies-which affect experimental sensitivity-is in its infancy. To address this issue, studies have analyzed the molecular features of highly active sgRNAs, but independent cross-validation is lacking. Utilizing fluorescent reporter knock-out assays with verification at selected endogenous loci, we experimentally quantified the target efficacies of 430 sgRNAs. Based on this dataset we tested the predictive value of five recently-established prediction algorithms. Our analysis revealed a moderate correlation (r = 0.04 to r = 0.20) between the predicted and measured activity of the sgRNAs, and modest concordance between the different algorithms. We uncovered a strong PAM-distal GC-content-dependent activity, which enabled the exclusion of inactive sgRNAs. By deriving nine additional predictive features we generated a linear model-based discrete system for the efficient selection (r = 0.4) of effective sgRNAs (CRISPRater). We proved our algorithms' efficacy on small and large external datasets, and provide a versatile combined on- and off-target sgRNA scanning platform. Altogether, our study highlights current issues and efforts in sgRNA efficacy prediction, and provides an easily-applicable discrete system for selecting efficient sgRNAs.

29263378	G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest and most diverse group of membrane receptors in eukaryotes and detect a wide array of cues in the human body. Here we describe a molecular device that couples CRISPR-dCas9 genome regulation to diverse natural and synthetic extracellular signals via GPCRs. We generate alternative architectures for fusing CRISPR to GPCRs utilizing the previously reported design, Tango, and our design, ChaCha. Mathematical modeling suggests that for the CRISPR ChaCha design, multiple dCas9 molecules can be released across the lifetime of a GPCR. The CRISPR ChaCha is dose-dependent, reversible, and can activate multiple endogenous genes simultaneously in response to extracellular ligands. We adopt the design to diverse GPCRs that sense a broad spectrum of ligands, including synthetic compounds, chemokines, mitogens, fatty acids, and hormones. This toolkit of CRISPR-coupled GPCRs provides a modular platform for rewiring diverse ligand sensing to targeted genome regulation for engineering cellular functions.

CAS-EXPAR was primed by the target DNA fragment produced by cleavage of CRISPR/Cas9, and the amplification reaction performed cyclically to generate a large number of DNA replicates which were detected using a real-time fluorescence monitoring method. This strategy that combines the advantages of CRISPR/Cas9 and exponential amplification showed high specificity as well as rapid amplification kinetics. Unlike conventional nucleic acids amplification reactions, CAS-EXPAR does not require exogenous primers, which often cause target-independent amplification. Instead, primers are first generated by Cas9/sgRNA directed site-specific cleavage of target and accumulated during the reaction. It was demonstrated this strategy gave a detection limit of 0.82 amol and showed excellent specificity in discriminating single-base mismatch. Moreover, the applicability of this method to detect DNA methylation and L. monocytogenes total RNA was also verified. Therefore, CAS-EXPAR may provide a new paradigm for efficient nucleic acid amplification and hold the potential for molecular diagnostic applications.	M Huang|X Zhou|H Wang|D Xing
29259531	Patent issues surrounding CRISPR, the revolutionary genetic editing technology, may have important implications for the public health. Patents maintain high prices for novel therapies, limiting patient access. Relatedly, insurance coverage for expensive therapies is waning. Patents also misallocate research and development resources to profitable disease indications rather than those that necessarily impinge on the public health. And it is unclear how CRISPR therapies will figure into the current regulatory framework for biosimilars. Policy makers and physicians should consider these issues now, before CRISPR therapies become widely adopted-and entrenched-in the marketplace.	JS Sherkow
29259521	Inherited metabolic diseases (IMDs) of the liver represent a vast and diverse group of rare genetic diseases characterized by the loss or dysfunction of enzymes or proteins essential for metabolic pathways in the liver. Conventional gene therapy involving adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotype 8 vectors provide therapeutically high levels of hepatic transgene expression facilitating the correction of the disease phenotype in pre-clinical studies and are currently being evaluated in clinical trials for multiple IMDs. However, insertional mutagenesis and immunogenicity risks as well as efficacy limitations represent major drawbacks for the AAV system. Genome editing tools, particularly the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) system, offer multiple advantages over conventional gene transfer and have the potential to further advance the promises of gene therapy. Here, we provide a critical assessment of conventional gene therapy and genome editing approaches for therapeutic correction of the most investigated metabolic liver disorders, namely familial hypercholesterolemia, hemophilia, ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, hereditary tyrosinemia type 1, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. In addition, we elaborate on the barriers and future directions for advancing novel nuclease mediated gene therapies for IMDs.	TE Bryson|CM Anglin|PH Bridges|RN Cottle
29259316	Isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IARS) syndrome is a recessive disease of Japanese Black cattle caused by a single nucleotide substitution. To repair the mutated IARS gene, we designed clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) to create a double-strand break near the mutation site. CRISPR/Cas9 and donor DNA that contained a synonymous codon for the correct amino acid and an Aequorea coerulescens Green Fluorescent Protein (AcGFP) cassette with a piggyBac transposase recognition site at both ends were introduced into bovine fetal fibroblast (BFF) cells isolated from a homozygous mutant calf. Recombinant cells were enriched on the basis of expression of AcGFP, and two cell lines that contained the repaired allele were subcloned. We generated somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) embryos from the repaired cells and transferred 22 blastocysts to recipient cows. In total, five viable fetuses were retrieved at Days 34 and 36. PiggyBac transposase mRNA was introduced into BFF cells isolated from cloned foetuses and AcGFP-negative cells were used for second round of cloning. We transferred nine SCNT embryos to recipient cows and retrieved two fetuses at Day 34. Fetal genomic DNA analysis showed correct repair of the IARS mutation without any additional DNA footprint.

29259295	Heterothallic strains of the Closterium peracerosum-strigosum-littorale (C. psl.) complex have two sexes, mating-type plus (mt+) and mating-type minus (mt-). Conjugation between these two sexes is regulated by two sex pheromones, protoplast-release-inducing protein (PR-IP) and PR-IP Inducer, which are produced by mt+ and mt- cells, respectively. PR-IP mediates the release of protoplasts from mt- cells during mating. In this study, we examined the mechanism of action of CpRLP1 (receptor-like protein 1), which was previously identified in a cDNA microarray analysis as one of the PR-IP-inducible genes. Using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we generated CpRLP1 knockout mutants in mt- cells of the C. psl. complex. When the knockout mt- cells were mixed with wild-type mt+ cells, conjugation was severely reduced. Many cells released protoplasts without pairing, suggesting a loss of synchronization between the two mating partners. Furthermore, the knockout mutants were hypersensitive to PR-IP. We conclude that CpRLP1 is a negative regulator of PR-IP that regulates the timing of protoplast release in conjugating C. psl. cells. As the first report of successful gene knockout in the class Charophyceae, this study provides a basis for research aimed at understanding the ancestral roles of genes that are indispensable for the development of land plants.

29259215	Site-specific recombination systems like those based on the Flp recombinase proved themselves as efficient tools for cell line engineering. The recent emergence of designer nucleases, especially RNA guided endonucleases like Cas9, has considerably broadened the available toolbox for applications like targeted transgene insertions. Here we established a recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE) protocol for the fast and effective, drug-free isolation of recombinant cells. Distinct fluorescent protein patterns identified the recombination status of individual cells. In derivatives of a CHO master cell line the expression of the introduced transgene of interest could be dramatically increased almost 20-fold by subsequent deletion of the fluorescent protein gene that provided the initial isolation principle. The same master cell line was employed in a comparative analysis using CRISPR/Cas9 for transgene integration in identical loci. Even though the overall targeting efficacy was comparable, multi-loci targeting was considerably more effective for Cas9-mediated transgene insertion when compared to RMCE. While Cas9 is inherently more flexible, our results also alert to the risk of aberrant recombination events around the cut site. Together, this study points at the individual strengths in performance of both systems and provides guidance for their appropriate use.	QV Phan|J Contzen|P Seemann|M Gossen
29257248	Even though the accrual of transcripts is implicated in distinct disease states, our knowledge regarding their functional role remains obscure. The CRISPR system has surged at the forefront of genome engineering tools in the field of RNA modulation. In the present review, we discuss some exciting applications of the CRISPR system, including the manipulation of RNA sequences, the visualization of chromosomal loci in living cells and the modulation of transcription. The CRISPR system has been documented to be very reliable and specific in altering gene expression, via leveraging inactive catalytically dead CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9). In the present review, the CRISPR system is presented as an eminent tool for the meticulous analysis of gene regulation, loci mapping and complex pathways.

29255251	Pooled CRISPR-Cas9 knock out screens provide a valuable addition to the methods available for novel drug target identification and validation. However, where gene editing is targeted to amplified loci, the resulting multiple DNA cleavage events can be a cause of false positive hit identification. The generation of nuclease deficient versions of Cas9 has enabled the development of two additional techniques - CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) and CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) - that enable the repression or overexpression, respectively, of target genes. Here we report the first direct combination of all three approaches (CRISPRko, CRISPRi and CRISPRa) in the context of genome-wide screens to identify components that influence resistance and sensitivity to the BRAF inhibitor, vemurafenib. The pairing of both loss- and gain-of-function datasets reveals complex gene networks which control drug response and illustrates how such data can add substantial confidence to target identification and validation analyses.

29253874	Prokaryotic organisms survive under constant pressure of viruses. CRISPR-Cas system provides its prokaryotic host with an adaptive immune defense against viruses that have been previously encountered. It consists of two components: Cas-proteins that cleave the foreign DNA and CRISPR array that suits as a virus recognition key. CRISPR array consists of a series of spacers, short pieces of DNA that originate from and match the corresponding parts of viral DNA called protospacers. Here we estimate the number of spacers in a CRISPR array of a prokaryotic cell which maximizes its protection against a viral attack. The optimality follows from a competition between two trends: too few distinct spacers make host vulnerable to an attack by a virus with mutated corresponding protospacers, while an excessive variety of spacers dilutes the number of the CRISPR complexes armed with the most recent and thus most useful spacers. We first evaluate the optimal number of spacers in a simple scenario of an infection by a single viral species and later consider a more general case of multiple viral species. We find that depending on such parameters as the concentration of CRISPR-Cas interference complexes and its preference to arm with more recently acquired spacers, the rate of viral mutation, and the number of viral species, the predicted optimal number of spacers lies within a range that agrees with experimentally-observed values.

29251498	Bacteria are under constant predation from viruses, called bacteriophages (phages). This threat has driven the evolution of multiple defense systems, including the CRISPR-Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and CRISPR associated genes) immune pathway. Phages are not passive bystanders in their CRISPR-mediated demise, however, as many have developed potent protein inhibitors of the bacterial adaptive immune system. Here, I review the work that led to the discovery of many distinct "anti-CRISPR" proteins. Furthermore, I outline how understanding their mechanisms of action has provided a suite of specific and high-affinity reagents to modulate and study CRISPR-Cas applications.	J Bondy-Denomy

29247196	Age related macular degeneration is the leading cause of blindness in the developed world. Although its precise cause remains elusive, dysfunction of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and dysregulation of complement have been implicated in its pathogenesis. The goal of this study was to evaluate the role of an AMP-dependent kinase (AMPK) activator, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide riboside (AICAR), on tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) induction of complement factor B (CFB) in RPE cells. We found that AICAR inhibited TNF-α-induced CFB expression in ARPE-19 and human primary RPE cells in a dose-dependent fashion. Treatment of cells with dipyridamole, which blocks AICAR cellular uptake abolished these effects. In contrast, the adenosine kinase inhibitor, 5-iodotubericidin, which inhibits the conversion of AICAR to the direct activator of AMPK, ZMP, did not reverse the effects on TNF-α-induced CFB expression, suggesting AMPK-independent effects. Indeed, knockout of AMPK in RPE cells using Clustered Regularly Interspaced Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 did not abolish the inhibitory effects of AICAR on RPE CFB expression. Collectively, our results suggest that AICAR can suppress TNF-α-induced CFB expression in RPE cells in an AMPK-independent mechanism, and could be used as a therapeutic target in certain complement over-activation scenarios.

29235467	RNA regulatory elements (RREs) are an important yet relatively under-explored facet of gene regulation. Deciphering the prevalence and functional impact of this post-transcriptional control layer requires technologies for disrupting RREs without perturbing cellular homeostasis. Here we describe genome-engineering based evaluation of RNA regulatory element activity (GenERA), a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 platform for in situ high-content functional analysis of RREs. We use GenERA to survey the entire regulatory landscape of a 3'UTR, and apply it in a multiplex fashion to analyse combinatorial interactions between sets of miRNA response elements (MREs), providing strong evidence for cooperative activity. We also employ this technology to probe the functionality of an entire MRE network under cellular homeostasis, and show that high-resolution analysis of the GenERA dataset can be used to extract functional features of MREs. This study provides a genome editing-based multiplex strategy for direct functional interrogation of RNA cis-regulatory elements in a native cellular environment.

29231142	A rapid search in scientific publication's databases shows how the use of CRISPR-Cas genome editions' technique has considerably expanded, and its growing importance, in modern molecular biology. Just in pub-med platform, the search of the term gives more than 3000 results. Specifically, in Drug Discovery, Medicinal Chemistry and Chemical Biology in general CRISPR method may have multiple applications. Some of these applications are: resistance-selection studies of antimalarial lead organic compounds; investigation of druggability; development of animal models for chemical compounds testing, etc. In this paper, we offer a review of the most relevant scientific literature illustrated with specific examples of application of CRISPR technique to medicinal chemistry and chemical biology. We also present a general overview of the main legal and ethical trends regarding this method of genome editing.	A Duardo-Sanchez
29230095	Designing efficient and specific CRISPR single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) is vital for the successful application of CRISPR technology. Currently, a growing number of new RNA-guided endonucleases with a different protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) have been discovered, suggesting the necessity to develop a versatile tool for designing sgRNA to meet the requirement of different RNA-guided DNA endonucleases. Here, we report the development of a flexible sgRNA design program named "CRISPR-offinder". Support for user-defined PAM and sgRNA length was provided to increase the targeting range and specificity. Additionally, evaluation of on- and off-target scoring algorithms was integrated into the CRISPR-offinder. The CRISPR-offinder has provided the bench biologist a rapid and efficient tool for identification of high quality target sites, and it is freely available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/crispr-offinder-v1-2/ or http://www.biootools.com.

29230052	How action potentials regulate myelination by oligodendrocytes is uncertain. We show that neuronal activity raises [Ca2+]i in developing oligodendrocytes in vivo and that myelin sheath elongation is promoted by a high frequency of [Ca2+]i transients and prevented by [Ca2+]i buffering. Sheath elongation occurs ~1 h after [Ca2+]i elevation. Sheath shortening is associated with a low frequency of [Ca2+]i transients but with longer duration [Ca2+]i bursts. Thus, [Ca2+]i controls myelin sheath development.	AM Krasnow|MC Ford|LE Valdivia|SW Wilson|D Attwell
29228332	The CRISPR-Cas system for prokaryotic adaptive immunity provides RNA-mediated protection from viruses and mobile genetic elements. Adaptation is dependent on the Cas1 and Cas2 proteins along with varying accessory proteins. Here we analyse the process in Sulfolobus solfataricus, showing that while Cas1 and Cas2 catalyze spacer integration in vitro, host factors are required for specificity. Specific integration also requires at least 400 bp of the leader sequence, and is dependent on the presence of hydrolysable ATP, suggestive of an active process that may involve DNA remodelling. Specific spacer integration is associated with processing of prespacer 3' ends in a PAM-dependent manner. This is reflected in PAM-dependent processing of prespacer 3' ends in vitro in the presence of cell lysate or the Cas4 nuclease, in a reaction consistent with PAM-directed binding and protection of prespacer DNA. These results highlight the diverse interplay between CRISPR-Cas elements and host proteins across CRISPR types.	C Rollie|S Graham|C Rouillon|MF White
29228039	Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMO) are important redox enzymes produced by microorganisms for the degradation of recalcitrant natural polysaccharides. Heterobasidion irregulare is a white-rot phytopathogenic fungus that causes wood decay in conifers. The genome of this fungus encodes 10 putative Auxiliary Activity family 9 (AA9) LPMOs. We describe the first biochemical characterization of H. irregulare LPMOs through heterologous expression of two CBM-containing LPMOs from this fungus (HiLPMO9H, HiLPMO9I) in Pichia pastoris. The oxidization preferences and substrate specificities of these two enzymes were determined. The two LPMOs were shown to cleave different carbohydrate components of plant cell walls. HiLPMO9H was active on cellulose and oxidized the substrate at the C1 carbon of the pyranose ring at β-1,4-glycosidic linkages, whereas HiLPMO9I cleaved cellulose with strict oxidization at the C4 carbon of glucose unit at internal bonds, and also showed activity against glucomannan. We propose that the two LPMOs play different roles in the plant-cell-wall degrading system of H. irregulare for degradation of softwood and that the lignocellulose degradation mediated by this white-rot fungus may require collective efforts from multi-types of LPMOs.

29228005	Myostatin (MSTN) is a powerful negative regulator of skeletal muscle mass in mammalian species that is primarily expressed in skeletal muscles, and mutations of its encoding gene can result in the double-muscling trait. In this study, the CRISPR/Cas9 technique was used to edit MSTN in Shaanbei Cashmere goats and generate knockout animals. RNA sequencing was used to determine and compare the transcriptome profiles of the muscles from three wild-type (WT) goats, three fibroblast growth factor 5 (FGF5) knockout goats (FGF5+/- group) and three goats with disrupted expression of both the FGF5 and MSTN genes (FM+/- group). The sequence reads were obtained using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 system and mapped to the Capra hircus reference genome using TopHat (v2.0.9). In total, 68.93, 62.04 and 66.26 million clean sequencing reads were obtained from the WT, FM+/- and FGF5+/- groups, respectively. There were 201 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the WT and FGF5+/- groups, with 86 down- and 115 up-regulated genes in the FGF5+/- group. Between the WT and FM+/- groups, 121 DEGs were identified, including 81 down- and 40 up-regulated genes in the FM+/- group. A total of 198 DEGs were detected between the FGF5+/- group and FM+/- group, with 128 down- and 70 up-regulated genes in the FM+/- group. At the transcriptome level, we found substantial changes in genes involved in fatty acid metabolism and the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, such as stearoyl-CoA dehydrogenase, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase 2, ELOVL fatty acid elongase 6 and fatty acid synthase, suggesting that the expression levels of these genes may be directly regulated by MSTN and that these genes are likely downstream targets of MSTN with potential roles in lipid metabolism in goats. Moreover, five randomly selected DEGs were further validated with qRT-PCR, and the results were consistent with the transcriptome analysis. The present study provides insight into the unique transcriptome profile of the MSTN knockout goat, which is a valuable resource for studying goat genomics.

29212058	Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis (S. Enteritidis) is one of the most prevalent serotypes in Salmonella isolated from poultry and the most commonly reported cause of human salmonellosis. In this study, we aimed to assess the genetic diversity of 329 S. Enteritidis strains isolated from different sources from 2009 to 2016 in China. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) typing was used to characterize these 262 chicken clinical isolates, 38 human isolates, 18 pig isolates, six duck isolates, three goose isolates and two isolates of unknown source. A total of 18 Enteritidis CRISPR types (ECTs) were identified, with ECT2, ECT8 and ECT4 as the top three ECTs. CRISPR typing identified ECT2 as the most prevalent ECT, which accounted for 41% of S. Enteritidis strains from all the sources except duck. ECT9 and ECT13 were identified in both pig and human isolates and revealed potential transmission from pig to human. A cluster analysis distributed 18 ECTs, including the top three ECTs, into four lineages with LI as the predominant lineage. Forty-eight out of 329 isolates were subjected to whole genome sequence typing, which divided them into four clusters, with Cluster I as the predominant cluster. Cluster I included 92% (34/37) of strains located in LI identified from the CRISPR typing, confirming the good correspondence between both typing methods. In addition, the CRISPR typing also revealed the close relationship between ECTs and isolated areas, confirming that CRISPR spacers might be obtained by bacteria from the unique phage or plasmid pools in the environment. However, further analysis is needed to determine the function of CRISPR-Cas systems in Salmonella and the relationship between spacers and the environment.

29211736	CRISPR/Cas9 technology enables efficient, rapid and cost-effective targeted genomic modification in a wide variety of cellular contexts including cultured cells. Some applications such as generation of double knock-outs, large deletions and paired-nickase cleavage require simultaneous expression of two gRNAs. Although single plasmids that enable multiplex expression of gRNAs have been developed, these require multiple rounds of cloning and/or PCR for generation of the desired construct. Here, we describe a series of vectors that enable generation of customized dual-gRNA expression constructs via an easy one-step golden gate cloning reaction using two annealed oligonucleotide inserts with different overhangs. Through nucleofection of mouse embryonic stem cells, we demonstrate highly efficient cleavage of the target loci using the dual-guide plasmids, which are available as Cas9-nuclease or Cas9-nickase expression constructs, with or without selection markers. These vectors are a valuable addition to the CRISPR/Cas9 toolbox and will be made available to all interested researchers via the Addgene plasmid repository.	F Adikusuma|C Pfitzner|PQ Thomas

29208717	The green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is an invaluable reference organism to research fields including algal, plant, and ciliary biology. Accordingly, decades-long standing inefficiencies in targeted nuclear gene editing broadly hinder Chlamydomonas research. Here we report that single-step codelivery of CRISPR/Cpf1 ribonucleoproteins with single-stranded DNA repair templates results in precise and targeted DNA replacement with as much as ∼10% efficiency in C. reinhardtii We demonstrate its use in transgene- and selection-free generation of sequence-specific mutations and epitope tagging at an endogenous locus. As the direct delivery of gene-editing reagents bypasses the use of transgenes, this method is potentially applicable to a wider range of species without the need to develop methods for stable transformation.

29204648	Pathologic angiogenesis is a component of many diseases, including neovascular age-related macular degeneration, proliferation diabetic retinopathy, as well as tumor growth and metastasis. The purpose of this project was to examine whether the system of adeno-associated viral (AAV)-mediated CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-associated endonuclease (Cas)9 can be used to deplete expression of VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) in human vascular endothelial cells in vitro and thus suppress its downstream signaling events.	The dual AAV system of CRISPR/Cas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes (AAV-SpGuide and -SpCas9) was adapted to edit genomic VEGFR2 in primary human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRECs). In this system, the endothelial-specific promoter for intercellular adhesion molecule 2 (ICAM2) was cloned into the dual AAV vectors of SpGuide and SpCas9 for driving expression of green fluorescence protein (GFP) and SpCas9, respectively. These two AAV vectors were applied to production of recombinant AAV serotype 5 (rAAV5), which were used to infect HRECs for depletion of VEGFR2. Protein expression was determined by Western blot; and cell proliferation, migration, as well as tube formation were examined.	AAV5 effectively infected vascular endothelial cells (ECs) and retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells; the ICAM2 promoter drove expression of GFP and SpCas9 in HRECs, but not in RPE cells. The results showed that the rAAV5-CRISPR/Cas9 depleted VEGFR2 by 80% and completely blocked VEGF-induced activation of Akt, and proliferation, migration as well as tube formation of HRECs.	AAV-CRISRP/Cas9-mediated depletion of VEGFR2 is a potential therapeutic strategy for pathologic angiogenesis.	W Wu|Y Duan|G Ma|G Zhou|C Park-Windhol|PA D'Amore|H Lei
29198467	Xenotransplantation could theoretically provide an unlimited supply of organs for patients living with end-stage kidney disease and other end-stage organ failure, but severe rejection and concerns about possible transmission of zoonotic infections remain important obstacles. In a recent study, investigators used CRISPR-cas9 to generate genetically modified pigs in which all endogenous retroviruses were inactivated. This approach may address one important barrier to the feasibility of clinical trials of xenotransplantation.	MJ Ross|PT Coates
29197744	MEN2A is a hereditary cancer-predisposing syndrome that affects patients with germline RET mutations. The effects of this oncogenic tyrosine kinase in the context of primitive stem cells are not known. In order to study these events, we generated a MEN2A induced Pluripotent Stem Cell (iPSC) line from a patient with RET mutation and an isogenic counterpart by CRISPR-Cas9 correction of the mutation. Whole exome sequencing of iPSC before and after CRISPR-Cas9 genome edition revealed no major exonic off target effect of the CRISPR correction. However, an integrative differential gene expression analysis of iPSC with oncogenic RETC634Y and its gene-corrected iPSC with RETY634C as well as RETwt iPSCs revealed activation of the Early Growth Response 1 (EGR1) transcriptional program in RET-mutated iPSC, a pathway shown to be involved in RET-induced oncogenesis. These data constitute the first proof of concept of the feasibility of the use of an iPSC and its genome-corrected counterpart to unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of the hereditary MEN2A cancer predisposing syndrome.

29197638	User-friendly tools for robust transcriptional activation of endogenous genes are highly demanded in plants. We previously showed that a dCas9-VP64 system consisting of the deactivated CRISPR-associated protein 9 (dCas9) fused with four tandem repeats of the transcriptional activator VP16 (VP64) could be used for transcriptional activation of endogenous genes in plants. In this study, we developed a second generation of vector systems for enhanced transcriptional activation in plants. We tested multiple strategies for dCas9-based transcriptional activation, and found that simultaneous recruitment of VP64 by dCas9 and a modified guide RNA scaffold gRNA2.0 (designated CRISPR-Act2.0) yielded stronger transcriptional activation than the dCas9-VP64 system. Moreover, we developed a multiplex transcription activator-like effector activation (mTALE-Act) system for simultaneous activation of up to four genes in plants. Our results suggest that mTALE-Act is even more effective than CRISPR-Act2.0 in most cases tested. In addition, we explored tissue-specific gene activation using positive feedback loops. Interestingly, our study revealed that certain endogenous genes are more amenable than others to transcriptional activation, and tightly regulated genes may cause target gene silencing when perturbed by activation probes. Hence, these new tools could be used to investigate gene regulatory networks and their control mechanisms. Assembly of multiplex CRISPR-Act2.0 and mTALE-Act systems are both based on streamlined and PCR-independent Golden Gate and Gateway cloning strategies, which will facilitate transcriptional activation applications in both dicots and monocots.

29194606	Clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats associated protein Cas9 (CRISPR-Cas9), originally an adaptive immunity system of prokaryotes, is revolutionizing genome editing technologies with minimal off-targets in the present era. The CRISPR/Cas9 is now highly emergent, advanced, and highly specific tool for genome engineering. The technology is widely used to animal and plant genomes to achieve desirable results. The present review will encompass how CRISPR-Cas9 is revealing its beneficial role in characterizing plant genetic functions, genomic rearrangement, how it advances the site-specific mutagenesis, and epigenetics modification in plants to improve the yield of field crops with minimal side-effects. The possible pitfalls of using and designing CRISPR-Cas9 for plant genome editing are also discussed for its more appropriate applications in plant biology. Therefore, CRISPR/Cas9 system has multiple benefits that mostly scientists select for genome editing in several biological systems.	MHU Khan|SU Khan|A Muhammad|L Hu|Y Yang|C Fan
29192200	The combination of genome-edited human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and subsequent neural differentiation is a powerful tool to study neurodevelopmental disorders. Since the naïve state of pluripotency has favourable characteristics for efficient genome-editing, we optimized a workflow for the CRISPR/Cas9 system in these naïve stem cells. Editing efficiencies of respectively 1.3-8.4% and 3.8-19% were generated with the Cas9 nuclease and the D10A Cas9 nickase mutant. Next to this, wildtype and genome-edited naïve hESCs were successfully differentiated to neural progenitor cells. As a proof-of-principle of our workflow, two monoclonal genome-edited naïve hESCs colonies were obtained for TUNA, a long non-coding RNA involved in pluripotency and neural differentiation. In these genome-edited hESCs, an effect was seen on expression of TUNA, although not on neural differentiation potential. In conclusion, we optimized a genome-editing workflow in naïve hESCs that can be used to study candidate genes involved in neural differentiation and/or functioning.

In this review, the author discusses the basic principles of genome editing, recent advances in clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-associated 9 technology, the impact on cardiovascular basic science research, possible therapeutic applications in patients with cardiovascular diseases, and finally the implications of potential clinical uses of human germline genome editing.

29190685	The application of RNA interference (RNAi) to mammalian cells has provided the means to perform phenotypic screens to determine the functions of genes. Although RNAi has revolutionized loss-of-function genetic experiments, it has been difficult to systematically assess the prevalence and consequences of off-target effects. The Connectivity Map (CMAP) represents an unprecedented resource to study the gene expression consequences of expressing short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs). Analysis of signatures for over 13,000 shRNAs applied in 9 cell lines revealed that microRNA (miRNA)-like off-target effects of RNAi are far stronger and more pervasive than generally appreciated. We show that mitigating off-target effects is feasible in these datasets via computational methodologies to produce a consensus gene signature (CGS). In addition, we compared RNAi technology to clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-based knockout by analysis of 373 single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) in 6 cells lines and show that the on-target efficacies are comparable, but CRISPR technology is far less susceptible to systematic off-target effects. These results will help guide the proper use and analysis of loss-of-function reagents for the determination of gene function.

29190429	Defining the mechanisms of cellular pathogenesis in rare lung diseases such as Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) is often complicated by loss of the differentiated phenotype of cultured primary alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells, as well as by a lack of durable cell lines that are faithful to both AT2-cell and rare disease phenotypes. We used CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to generate a series of HPS-specific mutations in the MLE-15 cell line. The resulting MLE-15/HPS cell lines exhibit preservation of AT2 cellular functions, including formation of lamellar body-like organelles, complete processing of surfactant protein B, and known features of HPS specific to each trafficking complex, including loss of protein targeting to lamellar bodies. MLE-15/HPS1 and MLE-15/HPS2 (with a mutation in Ap3β1) express increased macrophage chemotactic protein-1, a well-described mediator of alveolitis in patients with HPS and in mouse models. We show that MLE-15/HPS9 and pallid AT2 cells (with a mutation in Bloc1s6) also express increased macrophage chemotactic protein-1, suggesting that mice and humans with BLOC-1 mutations may also be susceptible to alveolitis. In addition to providing a flexible platform to examine the role of HPS-specific mutations in trafficking AT2 cells, MLE-15/HPS cell lines provide a durable resource for high-throughput screening and studies of cellular pathophysiology that are likely to accelerate progress toward developing novel therapies for this rare lung disease.

29189942	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated protein (Cas) is a microbial adaptive immune system. CRISPR-Cas systems are classified into two main classes and six types. Cpf1 is a putative type V (class II) CRISPR effector, which has revolutionized the genome editing approaches through multiple distinct features such as using T-rich protospacer-adjacent motif, applying a short guide RNA lacking trans-activating crRNA, introducing a staggered double-strand break, and possessing RNA processing activity in addition to DNA nuclease activity. In the present review, we attempt to highlight most recent advances in CRISPR-Cpf1 (CRISPR-Cas12a) system in particular, considering ground expeditions of the nature and the biology of this system, introducing novel Cpf1 variants that have broadened the versatility and feasibility of CRISPR-Cpf1 system, and lastly the great impact of the CRISPR-Cpf1 system on the manipulation of the genome of prokaryotic, mammalian, and plant models is summarized. With regard to recent developments in utilizing the CRISPR-Cpf1 system in genome editing of various organisms, it can be concluded with confidence that this system is a reliable molecular toolbox of genome editing approaches.

29187645	Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe, progressive muscle disease caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene. The majority of DMD mutations are deletions that prematurely terminate the dystrophin protein. Deletions of exon 50 of the dystrophin gene are among the most common single exon deletions causing DMD. Such mutations can be corrected by skipping exon 51, thereby restoring the dystrophin reading frame. Using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated 9 (CRISPR/Cas9), we generated a DMD mouse model by deleting exon 50. These ΔEx50 mice displayed severe muscle dysfunction, which was corrected by systemic delivery of adeno-associated virus encoding CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing components. We optimized the method for dystrophin reading frame correction using a single guide RNA that created reframing mutations and allowed skipping of exon 51. In conjunction with muscle-specific expression of Cas9, this approach restored up to 90% of dystrophin protein expression throughout skeletal muscles and the heart of ΔEx50 mice. This method of permanently bypassing DMD mutations using a single cut in genomic DNA represents a step toward clinical correction of DMD mutations and potentially those of other neuromuscular disorders.

29186338	Following the type II CRISPR-Cas9 system, type V CRISPR-Cpf1 endonucleases have been found to be applicable for genome editing in various organisms in vivo. However, there are as yet no web-based tools capable of optimally selecting guide RNAs (gRNAs) among all possible genome-wide target sites. Here, we present Cpf1-Database, a genome-wide gRNA library design tool for LbCpf1 and AsCpf1, which have DNA recognition sequences of 5'-TTTN-3' at the 5' ends of target sites. Cpf1-Database provides a sophisticated but simple way to design gRNAs for AsCpf1 nucleases on the genome scale. One can easily access the data using a straightforward web interface, and using the powerful collections feature one can easily design gRNAs for thousands of genes in short time.

29186130	The CRISPR-Cas9 system enables global screens of gene function with high sensitivity and specificity, but off-target effects have been reported for CRISPR guide RNAs targeting genes that are amplified at high copy number. A new study describes a computational approach to correct for this copy number effect, increasing the specificity of CRIPSR screens to identify essential genes.	JP Shen|T Ideker
29185448	The generation of gene-edited animals using the CRISPRs/Cas9 system is based on microinjection into zygotes which is inefficient, time consuming and demands high technical skills. We report the optimization of an electroporation method for intact rat zygotes using sgRNAs and Cas9 protein in combination or not with ssODNs (~100 nt). This resulted in high frequency of knockouts, between 15 and 50% of analyzed animals. Importantly, using ssODNs as donor template resulted in precise knock-in mutations in 25-100% of analyzed animals, comparable to microinjection. Electroporation of long ssDNA or dsDNA donors successfully used in microinjection in the past did not allow generation of genome-edited animals despite dsDNA visualization within zygotes. Thus, simultaneous electroporation of a large number of intact rat zygotes is a rapid, simple, and efficient method for the generation of a variety of genome-edited rats.

29184850	The Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans cytolethal distending toxin (Cdt) is a heterotrimeric AB2 toxin capable of inducing lymphocytes, and other cell types, to undergo cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Exposure to Cdt results in binding to the cell surface followed by internalization and translocation of the active subunit, CdtB, to intracellular compartments. These events are dependent upon toxin binding to cholesterol in the context of lipid rich membrane microdomains often referred to as lipid rafts. We now demonstrate that, in addition to binding to the plasma membrane of lymphocytes, another early and critical event initiated by Cdt is the translocation of the host cell protein, cellugyrin (synaptogyrin-2) to the same cholesterol-rich microdomains. Furthermore, we demonstrate that cellugyrin is an intracellular binding partner for CdtB as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation. Using CRISPR/cas9 gene editing we established a Jurkat cell line deficient in cellugyrin expression (JurkatCg-); these cells were capable of binding Cdt, but unable to internalize CdtB. Furthermore, JurkatCg- cells were not susceptible to Cdt-induced toxicity; these cells failed to exhibit blockade of the PI-3K signaling pathway, cell cycle arrest or cell death. We propose that cellugyrin plays a critical role in the internalization and translocation of CdtB to critical intracellular target sites. These studies provide critical new insight into the mechanism by which Cdt, and in particular, CdtB is able to induce toxicity.	K Boesze-Battaglia|LP Walker|A Dhingra|K Kandror|HY Tang|BJ Shenker
29184000	The islet-specific zinc transporter ZnT8 is a major self-antigen found in insulin granules of pancreatic β-cells. Frequent insulin secretion exposes ZnT8 to the cell surface, but the humoral antigenicity of the surface-displayed ZnT8 remains unknown. Here we show that a membrane-embedded human ZnT8 antigen triggered a vigorous immune response in ZnT8 knock-out mice. Approximately 50% of serum immunoreactivities toward ZnT8 were mapped to its transmembrane domain that is accessible to extracellular ZnT8 antibody (ZnT8A). ZnT8A binding was detected on live rat insulinoma INS-1E cells, and the binding specificity was validated by a CRISPR/Cas9 mediated ZnT8 knock-out. Applying established ZnT8A assays to purified serum antibodies from patients with type 1 diabetes, we detected human ZnT8A bound to live INS-1E cells, whereas a ZnT8 knock-out specifically reduced the surface binding. Our results demonstrate that ZnT8 is a cell surface self-antigen, raising the possibility of a direct involvement in antibody-mediated β-cell dysfunction and cytotoxicity.

29180373	Predation of starter lactic acid bacteria such as Streptococcus thermophilus by bacteriophages is a persistent and costly problem in the dairy industry. CRISPR-mediated bacteriophage insensitive mutants (BIMs), while straightforward to generate and verify, can quickly be overcome by mutant phages. The aim of this study was to develop a tool allowing the generation of derivatives of commercial S. thermophilus strains which are resistant to phage attack through a non-CRISPR-mediated mechanism, with the objective of generating BIMs exhibiting stable resistance against a range of isolated lytic S. thermophilus phages. To achieve this, standard BIM generation was complemented by the use of the wild-type (WT) strain which had been transformed with an antisense mRNA-generating plasmid (targeting a crucial CRISPR-associated [cas] gene) in order to facilitate the generation of non-CRISPR-mediated BIMs. Phage sensitivity assays suggest that non-CRISPR-mediated BIMs exhibit some advantages compared to CRISPR-mediated BIMs derived from the same strain.IMPORTANCE The outlined approach reveals the presence of a powerful host-imposed barrier for phage infection in S. thermophilus Considering the detrimental economic consequences of phage infection in the dairy processing environment, the developed methodology has widespread applications, particularly where other methods may not be practical or effective in obtaining robust, phage-tolerant S. thermophilus starter strains.

29179174	Genome editing technology can alter the genomic sequence at will, contributing the creation of cellular and animal models of human diseases including hereditary disorders and cancers, and the generation of the mutation-corrected human induced pluripotent stem cells for ex vivo regenerative medicine. In addition, novel approaches such as drug development using genome-wide CRISPR screening and cancer suppression using epigenome editing technology, which can change the epigenetic modifications in a site-specific manner, have also been conducted. In this article, I summarize the current advances and future prospects of genome editing technology in the field of biomedicine.	T Sakuma
29177091	Yersinia pseudotuberculosis is a Gram-negative intestinal pathogen of humans and has been responsible for several nationwide gastrointestinal outbreaks. Large-scale population genomic studies have been performed on the other human pathogenic species of the genus Yersinia, Yersinia pestis and Yersinia enterocolitica allowing a high-resolution understanding of the ecology, evolution and dissemination of these pathogens. However, to date no purpose-designed large-scale global population genomic analysis of Y. pseudotuberculosis has been performed. Here we present analyses of the genomes of 134 strains of Y. pseudotuberculosis isolated from around the world, from multiple ecosystems since the 1960s. Our data display a phylogeographic split within the population, with an Asian ancestry and subsequent dispersal of successful clonal lineages into Europe and the rest of the world. These lineages can be differentiated by CRISPR cluster arrays, and we show that the lineages are limited with respect to inter-lineage genetic exchange. This restriction of genetic exchange maintains the discrete lineage structure in the population despite co-existence of lineages for thousands of years in multiple countries. Our data highlights how CRISPR can be informative of the evolutionary trajectory of bacterial lineages, and merits further study across bacteria.

29174635	Today, the CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) region within bacterial and archaeal genomes is known to encode an adaptive immune system. We rely on previous results on the evolution of the CRISPR arrays, which led to the ordered independent loss model, introduced by Kupczok and Bollback (2013). When focusing on the spacers (between the repeats), new elements enter a CRISPR array at rate θ at the leader end of the array, while all spacers present are lost at rate ρ along the phylogeny relating the sample. Within this model, we compute the distribution of distances of spacers which are present in all arrays in a sample of size n. We use these results to estimate the loss rate ρ from spacer array data for n=2 and n=3.	F Baumdicker|AMI Huebner|P Pfaffelhuber
29174224	Parasitic nematodes are biomedically and economically important, but many are genetically intractable which limits our understanding of their molecular and cellular biology.

29170458	CRISPR/Cas9 holds immense potential to treat a range of genetic disorders. Allele-specific gene disruption induced by non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) DNA repair offers a potential treatment option for autosomal dominant disease. Here, we successfully delivered a plasmid encoding S. pyogenes Cas9 and sgRNA to the corneal epithelium by intrastromal injection and acheived long-term knockdown of a corneal epithelial reporter gene, demonstrating gene disruption via NHEJ in vivo. In addition, we used TGFBI corneal dystrophies as a model of autosomal dominant disease to assess the use of CRISPR/Cas9 in two allele-specific systems, comparing cleavage using a SNP-derived PAM to a guide specific approach. In vitro, cleavage via a SNP-derived PAM was found to confer stringent allele-specific cleavage, while a guide-specific approach lacked the ability to distinguish between the wild-type and mutant alleles. The failings of the guide-specific approach highlights the necessity for meticulous guide design and assessment, as various degrees of allele-specificity are achieved depending on the guide sequence employed. A major concern for the use of CRISPR/Cas9 is its tendency to cleave DNA non-specifically at "off-target" sites. Confirmation that S. pyogenes Cas9 lacks the specificity to discriminate between alleles differing by a single base-pair regardless of the position in the guide is demonstrated.

29169146	CRISPR-Cas systems are adaptive immune systems that protect their hosts from predation by bacteriophages (phages) and parasitism by other mobile genetic elements (MGEs). Given the potent nuclease activity of CRISPR effectors, these enzymes must be carefully regulated to minimize toxicity and maximize anti-phage immunity. While attention has been given to the transcriptional regulation of these systems (reviewed in [1]), less consideration has been given to the crucial post-translational processes that govern enzyme activation and inactivation. Here, we review recent findings that describe how Cas nucleases are controlled in diverse systems to provide a robust anti-viral response while limiting auto-immunity. We also draw comparisons to a distinct bacterial immune system, restriction-modification.	LM Leon|SD Mendoza|J Bondy-Denomy
29167381	CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing offers the possibility to knock out almost any gene of interest in an affordable and simple manner. The most common strategy is the introduction of a frameshift into the open reading frame (ORF) of the target gene which truncates the coding sequence (CDS) and targets the corresponding transcript for degradation by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). However, we show that transcripts containing premature termination codons (PTCs) are not always degraded efficiently and can generate C-terminally truncated proteins which might have residual or dominant negative functions. Therefore, we recommend an alternative approach for knocking out genes, which combines CRISPR/Cas9 with gene traps (CRISPR-Trap) and is applicable to ∼50% of all spliced human protein-coding genes and a large subset of lncRNAs. CRISPR-Trap completely prevents the expression of the ORF and avoids expression of C-terminal truncated proteins. We demonstrate the feasibility of CRISPR-Trap by utilizing it to knock out several genes in different human cell lines. Finally, we also show that this approach can be used to efficiently generate gene replacements allowing for modulation of protein levels for otherwise lethal knockouts (KOs). Thus, CRISPR-Trap offers several advantages over conventional KO approaches and allows for generation of clean CRISPR/Cas9-based KOs.

29167374	Animals, including humans, can adapt to environmental stress through phenotypic plasticity. The free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans can adapt to harsh environments by undergoing a whole-animal change, involving exiting reproductive development and entering the stress-resistant dauer larval stage. The dauer is a dispersal stage with dauer-specific behaviors for finding and stowing onto carrier animals, but how dauers acquire these behaviors, despite having a physically limited nervous system of 302 neurons, is poorly understood. We compared dauer and reproductive development using whole-animal RNA sequencing at fine time points and at sufficient depth to measure transcriptional changes within single cells. We detected 8,042 genes differentially expressed during dauer and reproductive development and observed striking up-regulation of neuropeptide genes during dauer entry. We knocked down neuropeptide processing using sbt-1 mutants and demonstrate that neuropeptide signaling promotes the decision to enter dauer rather than reproductive development. We also demonstrate that during dauer neuropeptides modulate the dauer-specific nictation behavior (carrier animal-hitchhiking) and are necessary for switching from repulsion to CO2 (a carrier animal cue) in nondauers to CO2 attraction in dauers. We tested individual neuropeptides using CRISPR knockouts and existing strains and demonstrate that the combined effects of flp-10 and flp-17 mimic the effects of sbt-1 on nictation and CO2 attraction. Through meta-analysis, we discovered similar up-regulation of neuropeptides in the dauer-like infective juveniles of diverse parasitic nematodes, suggesting the antiparasitic target potential of SBT-1. Our findings reveal that, under stress, increased neuropeptide signaling in C. elegans enhances their decision-making accuracy and expands their behavioral repertoire.

29162699	A segmental deletion resulting in DNAJB1-PRKACA gene fusion is now recognized as the signature genetic event of fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FL-HCC), a rare but lethal liver cancer that primarily affects adolescents and young adults. Here we implement CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing and transposon-mediated somatic gene transfer to demonstrate that expression of either the endogenous fusion protein or a chimeric cDNA leads to the formation of indolent liver tumors in mice that closely resemble human FL-HCC. Notably, overexpression of the wild-type PRKACA was unable to fully recapitulate the oncogenic activity of DNAJB1-PRKACA, implying that FL-HCC does not simply result from enhanced PRKACA expression. Tumorigenesis was significantly enhanced by genetic activation of β-catenin, an observation supported by evidence of recurrent Wnt pathway mutations in human FL-HCC, as well as treatment with the hepatotoxin 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine, which causes tissue injury, inflammation, and fibrosis. Our study validates the DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion kinase as an oncogenic driver and candidate drug target for FL-HCC, and establishes a practical model for preclinical studies to identify strategies to treat this disease.

29161464	The CRISPR/Cas9 system has greatly improved our ability to engineer targeted mutations in eukaryotic genomes. While CRISPR/Cas9 appears to work universally, the efficiency of targeted mutagenesis and the adverse generation of off-target mutations vary greatly between different organisms. In this study, we report that Arabidopsis plants subjected to heat stress at 37°C show much higher frequencies of CRISPR-induced mutations compared to plants grown continuously at the standard temperature (22°C). Using quantitative assays relying on green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter genes, we found that targeted mutagenesis by CRISPR/Cas9 in Arabidopsis is increased by approximately 5-fold in somatic tissues and up to 100-fold in the germline upon heat treatment. This effect of temperature on the mutation rate is not limited to Arabidopsis, as we observed a similar increase in targeted mutations by CRISPR/Cas9 in Citrus plants exposed to heat stress at 37°C. In vitro assays demonstrate that Cas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes (SpCas9) is more active in creating double-stranded DNA breaks at 37°C than at 22°C, thus indicating a potential contributing mechanism for the in vivo effect of temperature on CRISPR/Cas9. This study reveals the importance of temperature in modulating SpCas9 activity in eukaryotes, and provides a simple method to increase on-target mutagenesis in plants using CRISPR/Cas9.

29161261	As model organism-based research shifts from forward to reverse genetics approaches, largely due to the ease of genome editing technology, a low frequency of abnormal phenotypes is being observed in lines with mutations predicted to lead to deleterious effects on the encoded protein. In zebrafish, this low frequency is in part explained by compensation by genes of redundant or similar function, often resulting from the additional round of teleost-specific whole genome duplication within vertebrates. Here we offer additional explanations for the low frequency of mutant phenotypes. We analyzed mRNA processing in seven zebrafish lines with mutations expected to disrupt gene function, generated by CRISPR/Cas9 or ENU mutagenesis methods. Five of the seven lines showed evidence of altered mRNA processing: one through a skipped exon that did not lead to a frame shift, one through nonsense-associated splicing that did not lead to a frame shift, and three through the use of cryptic splice sites. These results highlight the need for a methodical analysis of the mRNA produced in mutant lines before making conclusions or embarking on studies that assume loss of function as a result of a given genomic change. Furthermore, recognition of the types of adaptations that can occur may inform the strategies of mutant generation.

29158838	The emergence of targeted and efficient genome editing technologies, such as repurposed bacterial programmable nucleases (e.g., CRISPR-Cas systems), has abetted the development of cell engineering approaches. Lessons learned from the development of RNA-interference (RNA-i) therapies can spur the translation of genome editing, such as those enabling the translation of human pluripotent stem cell engineering. In this review, we discuss the opportunities and the challenges of repurposing bacterial nucleases for genome editing, while appreciating their roles, primarily at the epigenomic granularity. First, we discuss the evolution of high-precision, genome editing technologies, highlighting CRISPR-Cas9. They exist in the form of programmable nucleases, engineered with sequence-specific localizing domains, and with the ability to revolutionize human stem cell technologies through precision targeting with greater on-target activities. Next, we highlight the major challenges that need to be met prior to bench-to-bedside translation, often learning from the path-to-clinic of complementary technologies, such as RNA-i. Finally, we suggest potential bioinformatics developments and CRISPR delivery vehicles that can be deployed to circumvent some of the challenges confronting genome editing technologies en route to the clinic.

29151576	The CRISPR-Cas9 RNA-guided endonuclease system allows precise and efficient modification of complex genomes and is continuously developed to enhance specificity, alter targeting and add new functional moieties. However, one area yet to be explored is the base chemistry of the associated RNA molecules. Here we show the design and optimisation of hybrid DNA-RNA CRISPR and tracr molecules based on structure-guided approaches. Through careful mapping of the ribose requirements of Cas9, we develop hybrid versions possessing minimal RNA residues, which are sufficient to direct specific nuclease activity in vitro and in vivo with reduced off-target activity. We identify critical regions within these molecules that require ribose nucleotides and show a direct correlation between binding affinity/stability and cellular activity. This is the first demonstration of a non-RNA-guided Cas9 endonuclease and first step towards eliminating the ribose dependency of Cas9 to develop a XNA-programmable endonuclease.

29150007	CRISPR-Cas9 has revolutionized the generation of transgenic animals. This system has demonstrated an unprecedented efficiency, multiplexability, and ease of use, thereby reducing the time and cost required for genome editing and enabling the production of animals with more extensive genetic modifications. It has also been shown to be applicable to﻿ a wide variety of animals, from early-branching metazoans to primates. Genome-wide screens in model organisms have been performed, accurate models of human diseases have been constructed, and potential therapies have been tested and validated in animal models. Several achievements in genetic modification of animals have been translated into products for the agricultural and pharmaceutical industries. Based on the remarkable progress to date, one may anticipate that in the future, CRISPR-Cas9 technology will enable additional far-reaching advances, including understanding the bases of diseases with complex genetic origins, engineering animals to produce organs for human transplantation, and genetically transforming entire populations of organisms to prevent the spread of disease.

29150005	CRISPR-Cas9 technology has revolutionized large-scale functional genomic screening in mammalian cell-culture systems. Due in part to optimized lentiviral delivery vectors; it is now possible to perform CRISPR-Cas9 screens in animals in order to study biological processes in the context of a whole organism and within more physiologically relevant environment. This chapter focuses primarily on mouse models of human cancers; viral vectors used for simultaneous tumor initiation and genome editing and sgRNA library design considerations. Experience with direct and indirect in vivo RNAi screens in the literature is also discussed in order to highlight the challenges of delivering diverse libraries of small RNAs in vivo.	JT Poirier
29150004	The introduction of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing in mammalian cells is a scientific breakthrough, which has greatly affected basic research and gene therapy. The simplicity and general access to CRISPR/Cas9 reagents has in an unprecedented manner "democratized" gene targeting in biomedical research, enabling genetic engineering of any gene in any cell, tissue, organ, and organism. The ability for fast, precise, and efficient profiling of the double-stranded break induced insertions and deletions (indels), mediated by any of the available programmable nucleases, is paramount to any given gene targeting approach. In this study we review the most commonly used indel detection methods and using a robust, sensitive, and cost efficient Indel Detection by Amplicon Analysis method, we have investigated the impact of the most commonly used CRISPR/Cas9 delivery formats, including lentivirus transduction, plasmid lipofection, and ribo nuclear protein electroporation, on the dynamics of indel profile formation. We observe rapid indel formation using RNP electroporation, especially with synthetic stabilized gRNA, as well as long-term decline in overall indel frequency with lipofectamine-based, plasmid transfection methods. Most methods reach peak editing on day 2-3 postdelivery. Furthermore, we find relative increase in frequency of larger size indels (>6bp) under condition of persistent editing using stably integrated lentiviral gRNA and Cas9 vectors.

29150003	The CRISPR/Cas9 system development has revolutionized the field of genome engineering through the efficient creation of targeted breaks in the DNA of almost any organism and cell type, opening an avenue for a wide range of applications in biomedical research and medicine. Apart from gene edition through knock-in or knock-out approaches, CRISPR/Cas9 technology has been used for many other purposes, including regulation of endogenous gene expression, epigenome editing, live-cell imaging of chromosomal loci, edition of RNA and high-throughput screening. With all those technological improvements, CRISPR/Cas9 system has broadened the number of alternatives for studying gene function and the generation of more accurate disease models.

29150002	A few years ago, we assisted in the demonstration for the first time of the revolutionary idea of a type of adaptive-immune system in the bacteria kingdom. This system, named CRISPR, and variants engineered in the lab, have been demonstrated as functional with extremely high frequency and fidelity in almost all eukaryotic cells studied to date. The capabilities of this RNA-guided nuclease have added to the interest that was announced with the advent of previous technologies for genome editing tools, such as ZFN and TALEN. The capabilities exhibited by these gene editors, opens up a novel scenario that indicates the promise of a next-generation medicine based on precision and personalized objectives, mostly due to the change in the paradigm regarding gene-surgery. This has certainly attracted, like never before, the attention of the biotech business and investor community. This chapter offers a brief overview of some of the factors that have contributed to a rapid entry into the biotech and pharmaceutical company's pipeline, focusing on how cell and gene therapies (CGT), collectively known as advanced therapies, have become the driving forces toward the therapeutic uses of gene editing technology. The sum of all those efforts for more than 30years has contributed to the new paradigm of considering genes as medicines.	JC Ramirez
29150001	CRISPR research is a very young research field since it was only 10years ago when the system was found to confer antiviral defense. Nevertheless, there has been an explosion of publications in CRISPR research in the past 5years. The research was started with the comparative genomics of microbial genomes early this century, which revealed the prevalence of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) in bacteria and archaea. Series of hypotheses were made based on bioinformatics analyses and tested experimentally within a few years after the CRISPR acronym was coined. These findings have not only led to the discovery of the unique antiviral system and the involved molecular mechanisms, but also to the development of CRISPR technology with various well-developed applications, such as genome editing in all three domains of life. Currently, widespread research efforts in multiple research disciplines have constantly yielded new insights into molecular mechanisms of CRISPR antiviral immunity, and new applications in scientific research and biomedical applications. Retrospectively, it is worth pointing out that close interdisciplinary interactions have fostered series of discoveries in the CRISPR research and worked as the driving force in the fast developing research field.

29143596	There has been considerable growth in basic knowledge and understanding of how genes are influencing response to exercise training and predisposition to injuries and chronic diseases. On the basis of this knowledge, clinical genetic tests may in the future allow the personalisation and optimisation of physical activity, thus providing an avenue for increased efficiency of exercise prescription for health and disease.	This review provides an overview of the current status of genetic testing for the purposes of exercise prescription and injury prevention. As such there are a variety of potential uses for genetic testing, including identification of risks associated with participation in sport and understanding individual response to particular types of exercise. However, there are many challenges remaining before genetic testing has evidence-based practical applications; including adoption of international standards for genomics research, as well as resistance against the agendas driven by direct-to-consumer genetic testing companies. Here we propose a way forward to develop an evidence-based approach to support genetic testing for exercise prescription and injury prevention.	Based on current knowledge, there is no current clinical application for genetic testing in the area of exercise prescription and injury prevention, however the necessary steps are outlined for the development of evidence-based clinical applications involving genetic testing.

29141958	Human intestinal epithelial organoids (IEOs) are increasingly being recognised as a highly promising translational research tool. However, our understanding of their epigenetic molecular characteristics and behaviour in culture remains limited.	We performed genome-wide DNA methylation and transcriptomic profiling of human IEOs derived from paediatric/adult and fetal small and large bowel as well as matching purified human gut epithelium. Furthermore, organoids were subjected to in vitro differentiation and genome editing using CRISPR/Cas9 technology.	We discovered stable epigenetic signatures which define regional differences in gut epithelial function, including induction of segment-specific genes during cellular differentiation. Established DNA methylation profiles were independent of cellular environment since organoids retained their regional DNA methylation over prolonged culture periods. In contrast to paediatric and adult organoids, fetal gut-derived organoids showed distinct dynamic changes of DNA methylation and gene expression in culture, indicative of an in vitro maturation. By applying CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to fetal organoids, we demonstrate that this process is partly regulated by TET1, an enzyme involved in the DNA demethylation process. Lastly, generating IEOs from a child diagnosed with gastric heterotopia revealed persistent and distinct disease-associated DNA methylation differences, highlighting the use of organoids as disease-specific research models.	Our study demonstrates striking similarities of epigenetic signatures in mucosa-derived IEOs with matching primary epithelium. Moreover, these results suggest that intestinal stem cell-intrinsic DNA methylation patterns establish and maintain regional gut specification and are involved in early epithelial development and disease.

29141705	The 15th natural plague focus in China, the Junggar Basin plague focus, is located near an important communication route connecting China and Central Asia and was discovered after 2005. To characterize the phenotypic and genetic diversity of the Yersinia pestis population in this newly established focus, we collected 25 Y. pestis strains from six counties across Junggar Basin in 2005-2006, and determined their biochemical features and genotypes based on multiple-locus variable number of tandem repeats analysis and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats analysis. We inferred the phylogenetic positions and possible sources of the Junggar strains by comparing their genotypes with the genetic diversity for known representative Y. pestis strains. Our results indicate that the major genotype of Junggar strains belongs to 2.MED1, a lineage of biovar Medievalis with identical biochemical characters and high virulence in mice. Although share a similar ecology, the 2.MED1 in Junggar Basin are not descended from known strains in the neighboring Central Asian Desert plague foci. Therefore, the emergence of the Junggar Basin plague focus is not attributable to the recent clonal spread of Y. pestis from Central Asia. We also identified two distinct minor genotypes in Junggar Basin, one of which clusters genetically with the 0.ANT1 strains of the Tianshan Mountain natural plague focus and another belongs to a 1.IN lineage not previously reported. Our study clarifies the phenotypic and genetic characters of Junggar Y. pestis strains. These findings extend our knowledge of the population diversity of Y. pestis and will facilitate future plague surveillance and prevention in Junggar Basin and adjacent regions.

29138316	The development of CRISPR/Cas9 technologies has dramatically increased the accessibility and efficiency of genome editing in many organisms. In general, in vivo germline expression of Cas9 results in substantially higher activity than embryonic injection. However, no transgenic lines expressing Cas9 have been developed for the major mosquito disease vector Aedes aegypti Here, we describe the generation of multiple stable, transgenic Ae. aegypti strains expressing Cas9 in the germline, resulting in dramatic improvements in both the consistency and efficiency of genome modifications using CRISPR. Using these strains, we disrupted numerous genes important for normal morphological development, and even generated triple mutants from a single injection. We have also managed to increase the rates of homology-directed repair by more than an order of magnitude. Given the exceptional mutagenic efficiency and specificity of the Cas9 strains we engineered, they can be used for high-throughput reverse genetic screens to help functionally annotate the Ae. aegypti genome. Additionally, these strains represent a step toward the development of novel population control technologies targeting Ae. aegypti that rely on Cas9-based gene drives.

29135047	This study was conducted to determine suitable conditions for an experimental method in which the CRISPR/Cas9 system is introduced into in vitro-produced porcine zygotes by electroporation. In the first experiment, when putative zygotes derived from in vitro fertilization (IVF) were electroporated by either unipolar or bipolar pulses, keeping the voltage, pulse duration and pulse number fixed at 30 V/mm, 1 msec and five repeats, respectively, the rate of blastocyst formation from zygotes electroporated by bipolar pulses decreased compared to zygotes electroporated by unipolar pulses. In the second experiment, the putative zygotes were electroporated by electroporation voltages ranging from 20 V/mm-40 V/mm with five 1-msec unipolar pulses. The rate of cleavage and blastocyst formation of zygotes electroporated at 40 V/mm was significantly lower (p < .05) than that of zygotes electroporated at less than 30 V/mm. Moreover, the apoptotic nuclei indices of blastocysts derived from zygotes electroporated by voltages greater than 30 V/mm significantly increased compared with those from zygotes electroporated by voltages less than 25 V/mm (p < .05). When zygotes were electroporated with Cas9 mRNA and single-guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting site in the FGF10 exon 3, the proportions of blastocysts with targeted genomic sequences were 7.7% (2/26) and 3.6% (1/28) in the embryos derived from zygotes electroporated at 25 V/mm and 30 V/mm, respectively. Our results indicate that electroporation at 25 V/mm may be an acceptable condition for introducing Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA into pig IVF zygotes under which the viability of the embryos is not significantly affected.

29119608	Astrocytes, the most abundant cells in the mammalian brain, perform key functions and are involved in several neurodegenerative diseases. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can persist in astrocytes, contributing to the HIV burden and neurological dysfunctions in infected individuals. While a comprehensive approach to HIV cure must include the targeting of HIV-1 in astrocytes, dedicated tools for this purpose are still lacking. Here we report a novel Adeno-associated virus-based vector (AAV9P1) with a synthetic surface peptide for transduction of astrocytes. Analysis of AAV9P1 transduction efficiencies with single brain cell populations, including primary human brain cells, as well as human brain organoids demonstrated that AAV9P1 targeted terminally differentiated human astrocytes much more efficiently than neurons. We then investigated whether AAV9P1 can be used to deliver HIV-inhibitory genes to astrocytes. To this end we generated AAV9P1 vectors containing genes for HIV-1 proviral editing by CRISPR/Cas9. Latently HIV-1 infected astrocytes transduced with these vectors showed significantly diminished reactivation of proviruses, compared with untransduced cultures. Sequence analysis identified mutations/deletions in key HIV-1 transcriptional control regions. We conclude that AAV9P1 is a promising tool for gene delivery to astrocytes and may facilitate inactivation/destruction of persisting HIV-1 proviruses in astrocyte reservoirs.

29115982	Salmonella Typhimurium is the most dominant Salmonella serovar around the world. It is associated with foodborne gastroenteritis outbreaks but has recently been associated with invasive illness and deaths. Characterization of S. Typhimurium is therefore very crucial for epidemiological surveillance. Phage typing has been used for decades for subtyping of S. Typhimurium to determine the epidemiological relation among isolates. Recent studies however have suggested that high throughput clustered regular interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) typing has the potential to replace phage typing. This study aimed to determine the efficacy of high-throughput CRISPR typing over conventional phage typing in epidemiological surveillance and outbreak investigation of S. Typhimurium.	In silico analysis of whole genome sequences (WGS) of well-documented phage types of S. Typhimurium reveals the presence of different CRISPR type among strains belong to the same phage type. Furthermore, different phage types of S. Typhimurium share identical CRISPR type. Interestingly, identical spacers were detected among outbreak and non-outbreak associated DT8 strains of S. Typhimurium. Therefore, CRISPR typing is not useful for the epidemiological surveillance and outbreak investigation of S. Typhimurium and phage typing, until it is replaced by WGS, is still the gold standard method for epidemiological surveillance of S. Typhimurium.	M Mohammed
29114069	Aerobic glycolysis, a phenomenon known historically as the Warburg effect, is one of the hallmarks of cancer cells. In this study, we characterized the role of BAG3 in aerobic glycolysis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and its molecular mechanisms. Our data show that aberrant expression of BAG3 significantly contributes to the reprogramming of glucose metabolism in PDAC cells. Mechanistically, BAG3 increased Hexokinase 2 (HK2) expression, the first key enzyme involved in glycolysis, at the posttranscriptional level. BAG3 interacted with HK2 mRNA, and the degree of BAG3 expression altered recruitment of the RNA-binding proteins Roquin and IMP3 to the HK2 mRNA. BAG3 knockdown destabilized HK2 mRNA via promotion of Roquin recruitment, whereas BAG3 overexpression stabilized HK2 mRNA via promotion of IMP3 recruitment. Collectively, our results show that BAG3 promotes reprogramming of glucose metabolism via interaction with HK2 mRNA in PDAC cells, suggesting that BAG3 may be a potential target in the aerobic glycolysis pathway for developing novel anticancer agents.

29107822	Prokaryotic Class 2 CRISPR-Cas systems mediate adaptive immunity against invasive genetic elements by means of standalone effector proteins that function as RNA-guided nucleases. The effectors Cas9 and Cas12 generate double-strand breaks in DNA substrates, which has been exploited for genome editing applications. In turn, Cas13 enzymes function as RNA-guided ribonucleases whose non-specific activity is triggered by target RNA binding. In this review, we highlight recent structural investigations of Cas9, Cas12 and Cas13 nucleases that have illuminated many aspects of their molecular mechanisms. In particular, these studies have highlighted the role of guide RNA seed sequences in facilitating target recognition and the importance of conformational transitions in controlling target binding and cleavage.

29100090	Renal agenesis and hypodysplasia (RHD) are major causes of pediatric chronic kidney disease and are highly genetically heterogeneous. We conducted whole-exome sequencing in 202 case subjects with RHD and identified diagnostic mutations in genes known to be associated with RHD in 7/202 case subjects. In an additional affected individual with RHD and a congenital heart defect, we found a homozygous loss-of-function (LOF) variant in SLIT3, recapitulating phenotypes reported with Slit3 inactivation in the mouse. To identify genes associated with RHD, we performed an exome-wide association study with 195 unresolved case subjects and 6,905 control subjects. The top signal resided in GREB1L, a gene implicated previously in Hoxb1 and Shha signaling in zebrafish. The significance of the association, which was p = 2.0 × 10-5 for novel LOF, increased to p = 4.1 × 10-6 for LOF and deleterious missense variants combined, and augmented further after accounting for segregation and de novo inheritance of rare variants (joint p = 2.3 × 10-7). Finally, CRISPR/Cas9 disruption or knockdown of greb1l in zebrafish caused specific pronephric defects, which were rescued by wild-type human GREB1L mRNA, but not mRNA containing alleles identified in case subjects. Together, our study provides insight into the genetic landscape of kidney malformations in humans, presents multiple candidates, and identifies SLIT3 and GREB1L as genes implicated in the pathogenesis of RHD.

29100008	Our understanding of early human development is typically based on inference from animal models, which may not fully recapitulate human embryonic features. As proof of concept, Fogarty et al. (2017) used CRISPR/Cas9 to genetically ablate the OCT4 gene in human preimplantation embryos and found key differences from its function in model systems.

29097366	Cholesterol metabolism is a dynamic process involving intracellular trafficking, cholesterol esterification, and cholesterol ester hydrolysis. Our objective was to identify genes that regulate macrophage cholesterol metabolism.	We performed quantitative trait loci mapping of free and esterified cholesterol levels and the ratio of esterified to free cholesterol in acetylated low-density lipoprotein-loaded bone marrow-derived macrophages from an AKR×DBA/2 strain intercross. Ten distinct cholesterol modifier loci were identified, and bioinformatics was used to prioritize candidate genes. The strongest locus was located on distal chromosome 1, which we named Mcmm1 (macrophage cholesterol metabolism modifier 1). This locus harbors the Soat1 (sterol O-acyltransferase 1) gene, encoding Acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase 1 (ACAT1), which esterifies free cholesterol. The parental AKR strain has an exon 2 deletion in Soat1, which leads to a 33 amino acid N-terminal truncation in ACAT1. CRISPR/Cas9 editing of DBA/2 embryonic stem cells was performed to replicate the AKR strain Soat1 exon 2 deletion, while leaving the remainder of the genome unaltered. DBA/2 stem cells and stem cells heterozygous and homozygous for the Soat1 exon 2 deletion were differentiated into macrophages and loaded with acetylated low-density lipoprotein. DBA/2 stem cell-derived macrophages accumulated less free cholesterol and more esterified cholesterol relative to cells heterozygous and homozygous for the Soat1 exon 2 deletion.	A Soat1 deletion present in AKR mice, and resultant N-terminal ACAT1 truncation, was confirmed to be a significant modifier of macrophage cholesterol metabolism. Other Mcmm loci candidate genes were prioritized via bioinformatics.	Q Hai|B Ritchey|P Robinet|AM Alzayed|G Brubaker|J Zhang|JD Smith
29095923	The segmental pattern of the vertebrate body is established via the periodic formation of somites from the presomitic mesoderm (PSM). This periodical process is controlled by the cyclic and synchronized activation of Notch signaling in the PSM. Protein O-fucosyltransferase1 (Pofut1), which transfers O-fucose to the EGF domains of the Notch1 receptor, is indispensable for Notch signaling activation. The Drosophila homologue Ofut1 was reported to control Notch localization via two different mechanisms, working as a chaperone for Notch or as a regulator of Notch endocytosis. However, these were found to be independent of O-fucosyltransferase activity because the phenotypes were rescued by Ofut1 mutants lacking O-fucosyltransferase activity. Pofut1 may also be involved in the Notch receptor localization in mice. However, the contribution of enzymatic activity of Pofut1 to the Notch receptor dynamics remains to be elucidated. In order to clarify the importance of the O-fucosyltransferase activity of Pofut1 for Notch signaling activation and the protein localization in the PSM, we established mice carrying point mutations at the 245th a.a. or 370-372th a.a., highly conserved amino-acid sequences whose mutations disrupt the O-fucosyltransferase activity of both Drosophila Ofut1 and mammalian Pofut1, with the CRISPR/Cas9 mediated genome-engineering technique. Both mutants displayed the same severely perturbed somite formation and Notch1 subcellular localization defects as the Pofut1 null mutants. In the mutants, Pofut1 protein, but not RNA, became undetectable by E9.5. Furthermore, both wild-type and mutant Pofut1 proteins were degraded through lysosome dependent machinery. Pofut1 protein loss in the point mutant embryos caused the same phenotypes as those observed in Pofut1 null embryos.	R Ajima|E Suzuki|Y Saga
29091957	The biology of Hepatitis E Virus (HEV), a common cause of epidemic and sporadic hepatitis, is still being explored. HEV exits liver through bile, a process which is essential for its natural transmission by feco-oral route. Though the process of this polarised HEV egress is not known in detail, HEV pORF3 and hepatocyte actin cytoskeleton have been shown to play a role.	Our transcriptome analysis in Hepatitis E virus (HEV) replicon transfected Huh7 cells at 24 and 72 hrs indicated that at 24hrs, both LncBISPR and BST2, expressed by a bidirectional promoter were highly upregulated whereas at 72 hrs, BST2 expression was comparatively reduced accompanied by normal levels of BISPR. These findings were confirmed by qPCR analysis. Co-localisation of BST2 and HEV pORF2 was confirmed in HEV transfected Huh7 by confocal microscopy. To investigate the role of BISPR/BST2 in HEV life cycle, particularly virus egress, we generated Huh7 cells with ~8kb deletion in BISPR gene using Crispr-Cas9 system. The deletion was confirmed by PCR screening, Sanger sequencing and Real time PCR. Virus egress in ΔBISPR Huh7 and Huh7 cells was compared by measuring HEV positive strand RNA copy numbers in cell lysates and culture supernatants at 24 and 72 hrs post HEV replicon transfection and further validated by western blot for HEV pORF2 capsid protein.	ΔBISPR Huh7 cells showed ~8 fold increase in virus egress at 24 hrs compared to Huh7 cells. No significant difference in virus egress was observed at 72hrs. Immunohistochemistry in histologically normal liver and HEV associated acute liver failure revealed BST2 overexpression in HEV infected hepatocytes and a dominant canalicular BST2 distribution in normal liver in addition to the cytoplasmic localisation reported in literature.	These findings lead us to believe that BISPR and BST2 may regulate egress of HEV virions into bile in vivo. This system may also be used to scale up virus production in vitro.

29091290	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated 9 activation (CRISPRa) systems have enabled genetic screens in cultured cell lines to discover and characterize drivers and inhibitors of cancer cell growth. We adapted this system for use in vivo to assess whether modulating endogenous gene expression levels can result in functional outcomes in the native environment of the liver. We engineered the catalytically dead CRISPR-associated 9 (dCas9)-positive mouse, cyclization recombination-inducible (Cre) CRISPRa system for cell type-specific gene activation in vivo. We tested the capacity for genetic screening in live animals by applying CRISPRa in a clinically relevant model of liver injury and repopulation. We targeted promoters of interest in regenerating hepatocytes using multiple single guide RNAs (gRNAs), and employed high-throughput sequencing to assess enrichment of gRNA sequences during liver repopulation and to link specific gRNAs to the initiation of carcinogenesis. All components of the CRISPRa system were expressed in a cell type-specific manner and activated endogenous gene expression in vivo. Multiple gRNA cassettes targeting a proto-oncogene were significantly enriched following liver repopulation, indicative of enhanced division of cells expressing the proto-oncogene. Furthermore, hepatocellular carcinomas developed containing gRNAs that activated this oncogene, indicative of cancer initiation events. Also, we employed our system for combinatorial cancer genetics in vivo as we found that while clonal hepatocellular carcinomas were dependent on the presence of the oncogene-inducing gRNAs, they were depleted for multiple gRNAs activating tumor suppressors.	The in vivo CRISPRa platform developed here allows for parallel and combinatorial genetic screens in live animals; this approach enables screening for drivers and suppressors of cell replication and tumor initiation.

29089503	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9), including specific guide RNAs (gRNAs), can excise integrated human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) provirus from host chromosomes. To date, anti-HIV-1 gRNAs have been designed to account for off-target activity, however, they seldom account for genetic variation in the HIV-1 genome within and between patients, which will be crucial for therapeutic application of this technology. This analysis tests the ability of published anti-HIV-1 gRNAs to cleave publicly available patient-derived HIV-1 sequences to inform gRNA design and provides basic computational tools to researchers in the field.

29088270	Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) is the most common childhood cancer in equatorial Africa, and is endemic to areas where people are chronically co-infected with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and the malaria pathogen Plasmodium falciparum. The contribution of these pathogens in the oncogenic process remains poorly understood. We showed earlier that the activation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 9 by hemozoin, a disposal product formed from the digestion of blood by P. falciparum, suppresses the lytic reactivation of EBV in BL cells. EBV lytic reactivation is regulated by the expression of transcription factor Zta (ZEBRA), encoded by the EBV gene BZLF1. Here, we explore in the BL cell line Akata, the mechanism involved in repression by TLR9 of expression of BZLF1. We show that BZLF1 repression is mediated upon TLR9 engagement by a mechanism that is largely independent of de novo protein synthesis. By CRISPR/Cas9-induced inactivation of TLR9, MyD88, IRAK4 and IRAK1 we confirm that BZLF1 repression is dependent on functional TLR9 and MyD88 signaling, and identify IRAK4 as an essential element for TLR9-induced repression of BZLF1 expression upon BCR cross-linking. Our results unprecedentedly show that TLR9-mediated inhibition of lytic EBV is largely independent of new protein synthesis and demonstrate the central roles of MyD88 and IRAK4 in this process contributing to EBV's persistence in the host's B-cell pool.

29084003	Lung cancer is one of the most common malignancies and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Although many oncogenes and tumor suppressors have been uncovered in the past decades, the pathogenesis and mechanisms of lung tumorigenesis and progression are unclear. The advancement of high-throughput sequencing technique and bioinformatics methods has led to the discovery of some unknown important protein-coding genes or noncoding RNAs in human cancers. In this study, we tried to identify and validate lung cancer driver genes to facilitate the diagnosis and individualized treatment of patients with this disease. To analyze distinct gene profile in lung cancer, the RNA sequencing data from TCGA and microarray data from Gene Expression Omnibus were used. Then, shRNA-pooled screen data and CRISPR-Cas9-based screen data in lung cancer cells were used to validate the functional roles of identified genes. We found that thousands of gene expression patterns are altered in lung cancer, and genomic alterations contribute to the dysregulation of these genes. Furthermore, we identified some potential lung cancer driver genes, such as TBX2, MCM4, SLC2A1, BIRC5, and CDC20, whose expression is significantly upregulated in lung cancer, and the copy number of these genes is amplified in the genome of patients with lung cancer. More importantly, overexpression of these genes is associated with poorer survival of patients with lung cancer, and knockdown or knockout of these genes results in decreased cell proliferation in lung cancer cells. Taken together, the genomewide comprehensive analysis combined with screen data analyses may provide a valuable help for identifying cancer driver genes for diagnosis and prevention of patients with lung cancer.

Gene-modified monkeys with gene overexpression or loss of function have been successfully generated with the rapid advance in gene manipulation technology such as lentivirus infection and programmable nucleases (ZFN, TALEN, CRISPR-Cas9). Here we review the recent development on gene-modified monkey generation by lentivirus and programmable nucleases.

29082490	Screening arrayed libraries of reagents, particularly small molecules began as a vehicle for drug discovery, but the in last few years it has become a cornerstone of biological investigation, joining RNAi and CRISPR as methods for elucidating functional relationships that could not be anticipated, and illustrating the mechanisms behind basic and disease biology, and therapeutic resistance. However, these approaches share some common challenges, especially with respect to specificity or selectivity of the reagents as they are scaled to large protein families or the genome. High-content screening (HCS) has emerged as an important complement to screening, mostly the result of a wide array of specific molecular events, such as protein kinase and transcription factor activation, morphological changes associated with stem cell differentiation or the epithelial-mesenchymal transition of cancer cells. Beyond the range of cellular events that can be screened by HCS, image-based screening introduces new processes for differentiating between specific and nonspecific effects on cells. This chapter introduces these complexities and discusses strategies available in image-based screening that can mitigate the challenges they can bring to screening.	SA Haney
29078358	During malaria blood-stage infections, Plasmodium parasites interact with the RBC surface to enable invasion followed by intracellular proliferation. Critical factors involved in invasion have been identified using biochemical and genetic approaches including specific knockdowns of genes of interest from primary CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (cRBCs). Here we report the development of a robust in vitro culture system to produce RBCs that allow the generation of gene knockouts via CRISPR/Cas9 using the immortal JK-1 erythroleukemia line. JK-1 cells spontaneously differentiate, generating cells at different stages of erythropoiesis, including terminally differentiated nucleated RBCs that we term "jkRBCs." A screen of small-molecule epigenetic regulators identified several bromodomain-specific inhibitors that promote differentiation and enable production of synchronous populations of jkRBCs. Global surface proteomic profiling revealed that jkRBCs express all known Pfalciparum host receptors in a similar fashion to cRBCs and that multiple Pfalciparum strains invade jkRBCs at comparable levels to cRBCs and RBCs. Using CRISPR/Cas9, we deleted two host factors, basigin (BSG) and CD44, for which no natural nulls exist. BSG interacts with the parasite ligand Rh5, a prominent vaccine candidate. A BSG knockout was completely refractory to parasite invasion in a strain-transcendent manner, confirming the essential role for BSG during invasion. CD44 was recently identified in an RNAi screen of blood group genes as a host factor for invasion, and we show that CD44 knockout results in strain-transcendent reduction in invasion. Furthermore, we demonstrate a functional interaction between these two determinants in mediating Pfalciparum erythrocyte invasion.

29078326	Developing tools to accurately predict the clinical prevalence of drug-resistant mutations is a key step toward generating more effective therapeutics. Here we describe a high-throughput CRISPR-Cas9-based saturated mutagenesis approach to generate comprehensive libraries of point mutations at a defined genomic location and systematically study their effect on cell growth. As proof of concept, we mutagenized a selected region within the leukemic oncogene BCR-ABL1 Using bulk competitions with a deep-sequencing readout, we analyzed hundreds of mutations under multiple drug conditions and found that the effects of mutations on growth in the presence or absence of drug were critical for predicting clinically relevant resistant mutations, many of which were cancer adaptive in the absence of drug pressure. Using this approach, we identified all clinically isolated BCR-ABL1 mutations and achieved a prediction score that correlated highly with their clinical prevalence. The strategy described here can be broadly applied to a variety of oncogenes to predict patient mutations and evaluate resistance susceptibility in the development of new therapeutics.

In genome editing, gene-knockout as well as gene-knockin are possible in various organisms and cultured cells. CRISPR-Cas9, which was developed in 2012, is a convenient and efficient programmable site-specific nuclease and the use spreads around the world rapidly. For this, it is important for the progress of life science research to introduce the genome editing technology.	T Yamamoto

29073264	During the erythrocytic cycle of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, egress and invasion are essential steps finely controlled by reversible phosphorylation. In contrast to the growing number of kinases identified as key regulators, phosphatases have been poorly studied, and calcineurin is the only one identified so far to play a role in invasion. PfShelph2, a bacterial-like phosphatase, is a promising candidate to participate in the invasion process, as it was reported to be expressed late during the asexual blood stage and to reside within an apical compartment, yet distinct from rhoptry bulb, micronemes, or dense granules. It was also proposed to play a role in the control of the red blood cell membrane deformability at the end of the invasion process. However, genetic studies are still lacking to support this hypothesis. Here, we take advantage of the CRISPR-Cas9 technology to tag shelph2 genomic locus while retaining its endogenous regulatory regions. This new strain allows us to follow the endogenous PfShelph2 protein expression and location during asexual blood stages. We show that PfShelph2 apical location is also distinct from the rhoptry neck or exonemes. We further demonstrate PfShelph2 dispensability during the asexual blood stage by generating PfShelph2-KO parasites using CRISPR-Cas9 machinery. Analyses of the mutant during the course of the erythrocytic development indicate that there are no detectable phenotypic consequences of Pfshelph2 genomic deletion. As this lack of phenotype might be due to functional redundancy, we also explore the likelihood of PfShelph1 (PfShelph2 paralog) being a compensatory phosphatase. We conclude that despite its cyclic expression profile, PfShelph2 is a dispensable phosphatase during the Plasmodium falciparum asexual blood stage, whose function is unlikely substituted by PfShelph1.

29070673	This study identifies a novel mechanism linking IL-17A with colon tissue repair and tumor development. Abrogation of IL-17A signaling in mice attenuated tissue repair of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced damage in colon epithelium and markedly reduced tumor development in an azoxymethane/DSS model of colitis-associated cancer. A novel IL-17A target gene, PLET1 (a progenitor cell marker involved in wound healing), was highly induced in DSS-treated colon tissues and tumors in an IL-17RC-dependent manner. PLET1 expression was induced in LGR5+ colon epithelial cells after DSS treatment. LGR5+PLET1+ marks a highly proliferative cell population with enhanced expression of IL-17A target genes. PLET1 deficiency impaired tissue repair of DSS-induced damage in colon epithelium and reduced tumor formation in an azoxymethane/DSS model of colitis-associated cancer. Our results suggest that IL-17A-induced PLET1 expression contributes to tissue repair and colon tumorigenesis.

29062071	CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune systems are widespread among bacteria and archaea. Recent studies have shown that these systems have minimal long-term evolutionary effects in limiting horizontal gene transfer. This suggests that the ability to evade CRISPR-Cas immunity must also be widespread in phages and other mobile genetic elements. In this Progress article, we discuss recent discoveries that highlight how phages inactivate CRISPR-Cas systems by using anti-CRISPR proteins, and we outline evolutionary and biotechnological implications of their activity.

29058724	Paraquat, a herbicide linked to Parkinson's disease, generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), which causes cell death. Because the source of paraquat-induced ROS production remains unknown, we conducted a CRISPR-based positive-selection screen to identify metabolic genes essential for paraquat-induced cell death. Our screen uncovered three genes, POR (cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase), ATP7A (copper transporter), and SLC45A4 (sucrose transporter), required for paraquat-induced cell death. Furthermore, our results revealed POR as the source of paraquat-induced ROS production. Thus, our study highlights the use of functional genomic screens for uncovering redox biology.

29054255	To monitor the progress of therapy and disease progression, periodic CD4 counts are required throughout the course of HIV/AIDS care and support. The demand for CD4 count measurement is increasing as ART programs expand over the last decade. This study aimed to predict CD4 count changes and to identify the predictors of CD4 count changes among patients on ART.	A cross-sectional study was conducted at the University of Gondar Hospital from 3,104 adult patients on ART with CD4 counts measured at least twice (baseline and most recent). Data were retrieved from the HIV care clinic electronic database and patients` charts. Descriptive data were analyzed by SPSS version 20. Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) methodology was followed to undertake the study. WEKA version 3.8 was used to conduct a predictive data mining. Before building the predictive data mining models, information gain values and correlation-based Feature Selection methods were used for attribute selection. Variables were ranked according to their relevance based on their information gain values. J48, Neural Network, and Random Forest algorithms were experimented to assess model accuracies.	The median duration of ART was 191.5 weeks. The mean CD4 count change was 243 (SD 191.14) cells per microliter. Overall, 2427 (78.2%) patients had their CD4 counts increased by at least 100 cells per microliter, while 4% had a decline from the baseline CD4 value. Baseline variables including age, educational status, CD8 count, ART regimen, and hemoglobin levels predicted CD4 count changes with predictive accuracies of J48, Neural Network, and Random Forest being 87.1%, 83.5%, and 99.8%, respectively. Random Forest algorithm had a superior performance accuracy level than both J48 and Artificial Neural Network. The precision, sensitivity and recall values of Random Forest were also more than 99%.	Nearly accurate prediction results were obtained using Random Forest algorithm. This algorithm could be used in a low-resource setting to build a web-based prediction model for CD4 count changes.

29053735	Pyridoxine dependent epilepsy (PDE) is caused by likely pathogenic variants in ALDH7A1 (PDE-ALDH7A1) and inherited autosomal recessively. Neurotoxic alpha-amino adipic semialdehyde (alpha-AASA), piperideine 6-carboxylate and pipecolic acid accumulate in body fluids. Neonatal or infantile onset seizures refractory to anti-epileptic medications are clinical features. Treatment with pyridoxine, arginine and lysine-restricted diet does not normalize neurodevelopmental outcome or accumulation of neurotoxic metabolites. There is no animal model for high throughput drug screening. For this reason, we developed and characterized the first knock-out aldh7a1 zebrafish model using CRISPR-Cas9 technology. Zebrafish aldh7a1 mutants were generated by using a vector free method of CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis. Genotype analysis of aldh7a1 knock-out zebrafish was performed by high resolution melt analysis, direct sequencing and QIAxcel system. Electroencephalogram was performed. Alpha-AASA, piperideine 6-carboxylate and pipecolic acid, were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Our knock-out aldh7a1 zebrafish has homozygous 5 base pair (bp) mutation in ALDH7A1. Knock-out aldh7a1 embryos have spontaneous rapid increase in locomotion and a rapid circling swim behavior earliest 8-day post fertilization (dpf). Electroencephalogram revealed large amplitude spike discharges compared to wild type. Knock-out aldh7a1 embryos have elevated alpha-AASA, piperideine 6-carboxylate and pipecolic acid compared to wild type embryos at 3 dpf. Knock-out aldh7a1 embryos showed no aldh7a1 protein by western blot compared to wild type. Our knock-out aldh7a1 zebrafish is a well characterized model for large-scale drug screening using behavioral and biochemical features and accurately recapitulates the human PDE-ALDH7A1 disease.

29052327	Genome modification at specific loci in livestock species was only achievable by performing homologous recombination in somatic cells followed by somatic cell nuclear transfer. The difficulty and inefficiency of this method have slowed down the multiple applications of genome modification in farm animals. The discovery of site-specific endonucleases has provided a different and more direct route for targeted mutagenesis, as these enzymes allow the ablation (KO) or insertion (KI) of specific genomic sequences on a single step, directly applied to zygotes. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR), the last site-specific endonuclease to be developed, is a RNA-guided endonuclease, easy to engineer and direct to a given target site. This technology has been successfully applied to rabbits, swine, goats, sheep and cattle, situating genome editing in livestock species at an attainable distance, thereby empowering scientist to develop a myriad of applications. Genetically modified livestock animals can be used as biomodels to study human or livestock physiology and disease, as bioreactors to produce complex proteins, or as organ donors for transplantation. Specifically on livestock production, genome editing in farm animals may serve to improve productive genetic traits, to improve various animal products, to confer resistance to diseases or to minimize the environmental impact on farming. In this review, we provide an overview of the current methods for site-specific genome modification in livestock species, discuss potential and already developed applications of genome edition in farm animals and debate about the possibilities for approval of products derived from gene-edited animals for human consumption.

29052269	Biotin is an essential cofactor utilized by all domains of life, but only synthesized by bacteria, fungi and plants, making biotin biosynthesis a target for antimicrobial development. To understand biotin biosynthesis in mycobacteria, we executed a genetic screen in Mycobacterium smegmatis for biotin auxotrophs and identified pyruvate carboxylase (Pyc) as required for biotin biosynthesis. The biotin auxotrophy of the pyc::tn strain is due to failure to transcriptionally induce late stage biotin biosynthetic genes in low biotin conditions. Loss of bioQ, the repressor of biotin biosynthesis, in the pyc::tn strain reverted biotin auxotrophy, as did reconstituting the last step of the pathway through heterologous expression of BioB and provision of its substrate DTB. The role of Pyc in biotin regulation required its catalytic activities and could be supported by M. tuberculosis Pyc. Quantitation of the kinetics of depletion of biotinylated proteins after biotin withdrawal revealed that Pyc is the most rapidly depleted biotinylated protein and metabolomics revealed a broad metabolic shift in wild type cells upon biotin withdrawal which was blunted in cell lacking Pyc. Our data indicate that mycobacterial cells monitor biotin sufficiency through a metabolic signal generated by dysfunction of a biotinylated protein of central metabolism.

29051052	The clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas9) system has enabled efficient genome engineering in diverse plant species. However, delivery of genome engineering reagents, such as the single guide RNA (sgRNA), into plant cells remains challenging. Here, we report the engineering of Tobacco rattle virus (TRV) and Pea early browning virus (PEBV) to deliver one or multiple sgRNAs into Nicotiana benthamiana and Arabidopsis thaliana (Col-0) plants that overexpress a nuclear localization signal containing Cas9. Our data showed that TRV and PEBV can deliver sgRNAs into inoculated and systemic leaves, and this resulted in mutagenesis of the targeted genomic loci. Moreover, in N. benthamiana, PEBV-based sgRNA delivery resulted in more targeted mutations than TRV-based delivery. Our data indicate that TRV and PEBV can facilitate plant genome engineering and can be used to produce targeted mutations for functional analysis and other biotechnological applications across diverse plant species. Key message: Delivery of genome engineering reagents into plant cells is challenging and inefficient and this limit the applications of this technology in many plant species. RNA viruses such as TRV and PEBV provide an efficient tool to systemically deliver sgRNAs for targeted genome modification.	Z Ali|A Eid|S Ali|MM Mahfouz
29050667	Prokaryotes modified stably on the genome are of great importance for production of fine and commodity chemicals. Traditional methods for genome engineering have long suffered from imprecision and low efficiencies, making construction of suitable high-producer strains laborious. Here, we review the recent advances in discovery and refinement of molecular precision engineering tools for genome-based metabolic engineering in bacteria for chemical production, with focus on the λ-Red recombineering and the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/Cas9 nuclease systems. In conjunction, they enable the integration of in vitro-synthesized DNA segments into specified locations on the chromosome and allow for enrichment of rare mutants by elimination of unmodified wild-type cells. Combination with concurrently developing improvements in important accessory technologies such as DNA synthesis, high-throughput screening methods, regulatory element design, and metabolic pathway optimization tools has resulted in novel efficient microbial producer strains and given access to new metabolic products. These new tools have made and will likely continue to make a big impact on the bioengineering strategies that transform the chemical industry.	S Oesterle|I Wuethrich|S Panke
29049737	The murine double minute (MDM)2 is a critical negative regulator of the p53 tumor suppressor, and MDM2 SNP309G is associated with a higher risk of proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR); in addition, the MDM2 T309G created using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/associated endonuclease (Cas)9 enhances normal rabbit vitreous-induced expression of MDM2 and survival of primary human retinal pigment epithelial (hRPE) cells in vitro. The goal of this study was to determine whether this MDM2 T309G contributes to the development of experimental PVR.	hRPE cells expressing MDM2 T309G or T309T only were treated with vitreous from human PVR donors (HV). The expression of MDM2 and p53 in the treated cells was examined by Western blot. The in vitro vitreous-induced cellular responses, such as contraction were assessed, and PVR was induced by intravitreal injection of the hRPE cells with MDM2 T309G or T309T only into rabbit eyes.	Western blot analyses indicated that treatment of hRPE cells with HV led to a significant increase (1.7 ± 0.2-fold) in the expression of MDM2 and a significant decrease in p53 in the cells expressing MDM2 T309G compared with those with MDM2 T309T. In addition, HV promoted contraction of the hRPE cells expressing MDM2 T309G significantly more than those with MDM2 T309T only. Furthermore, MDM2 T309G in the hRPE cells enhanced the development of PVR in a rabbit model.	The MDM2 SNP309 in RPE cells enhances their potential of PVR pathogenesis.

29039415	Pooled CRISPR screens are a powerful tool for assessments of gene function. However, conventional analysis is based exclusively on the relative abundance of integrated single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) between populations, which does not discern distinct phenotypes and editing outcomes generated by identical sgRNAs. Here we present CRISPR-UMI, a single-cell lineage-tracing methodology for pooled screening to account for cell heterogeneity. We generated complex sgRNA libraries with unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) that allowed for screening of clonally expanded, individually tagged cells. A proof-of-principle CRISPR-UMI negative-selection screen provided increased sensitivity and robustness compared with conventional analysis by accounting for underlying cellular and editing-outcome heterogeneity and detection of outlier clones. Furthermore, a CRISPR-UMI positive-selection screen uncovered new roadblocks in reprogramming mouse embryonic fibroblasts as pluripotent stem cells, distinguishing reprogramming frequency and speed (i.e., effect size and probability). CRISPR-UMI boosts the predictive power, sensitivity, and information content of pooled CRISPR screens.

29038945	The development of the genome editing system called CRISPR-Cas9 has opened a huge debate on the possibility of modifying the human germline. But the types of changes that could and/or ought to be made have not been discussed. To cast some light on this debate, I will describe the story of the CRISPR-Cas9 system. Then, I will briefly review the projects for modification of the human species that were discussed by biologists throughout the twentieth century. Lastly, I will show that for plenty of reasons, both scientific and societal, germline modification is no longer a priority for our societies.	M Morange
29032264	Therapeutic T cell engineering has recently garnered widespread interest because of the success of CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) therapy. CARs are synthetic receptors for antigen that redirect the specificity and reprogram the function of the T cells in which they are genetically introduced. CARs targeting CD19, a cell surface molecule found in most leukemias and lymphomas, have yielded high remission rates in patients with chemorefractory, relapsed disease, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The toxicities of this treatment include B cell aplasia, cytokine release syndrome (CRS), and neurotoxicity. Although reversible in most instances, these toxicities may require specific medical interventions, including transfer to intensive care to treat severe CRS. Guidelines for managing these toxicities are emerging. The recent report of a nonhuman primate model for CRS is poised to help advance the management of this syndrome. Finally, new engineering modalities, based on the use of targeted nucleases like CRISPR, may further enhance the efficacy and safety of CAR T cells.	MA Perales|P Kebriaei|LS Kean|M Sadelain
29031730	Functional investigation of novel gene/protein targets associated with adipocyte differentiation or function heavily relies on efficient and accessible tools to manipulate gene expression in adipocytes in vitro. Recent advances in gene-editing technologies such as CRISPR-Cas9 have not only eased gene editing but also greatly facilitated modulation of gene expression without altering the genome. Here, we aimed to develop and validate a competent in vitro adipocyte model of controllable functionality as well as multiplexed gene manipulation in adipocytes, using the CRISPRa "SAM" system and siRNAs to simultaneously overexpress and silence selected genes in the same cell populations.	We introduced a stable expression of dCas9-VP64 and MS2-P65, the core components of the CRIPSRa SAM system, in mesenchymal C3H/10T1/2 cells through viral delivery and used guide RNAs targeting Pparγ2, Prdm16, Zfp423, or Ucp1 to control the expression of key genes involved in adipocyte differentiation and function. We additionally co-transfected mature adipocytes with sgRNA plasmids and siRNA to simultaneously up-regulate and silence selected genes. Quantitative gene expression, oxygen consumption, fluorescence-activated cell sorting and immunocytochemistry served as validation proxies in pre- or mature adipocytes.	CRISPRa SAM-mediated up-regulation of a key adipogenic gene, Pparγ2, was successfully achieved using selected sgRNAs targeting the Pparγ2 promoter region (i.e. up to 104 fold); this induction was long lasting and sufficient to promote adipogenesis. Furthermore, co-activation of Pparγ2 with either Prdm16 or Zfp423 transcripts drove distinct thermogenic gene expression patterns associated with increased or decreased oxygen consumption, respectively, mimicking typical characteristics of brite/beige or white cell lineages. Lastly, we demonstrated that up-regulation of endogenous genes in mature adipocytes was also easily and efficiently achieved using CRISPRa SAM, here exemplified by targeted Ucp1 overexpression (up to 4 × 103 fold), and that it was compatible with concomitant gene silencing using siRNA, allowing for bidirectional manipulation of gene expression in the same cell populations.	We demonstrate that the CRISPRa SAM system can be easily adopted and used to efficiently manipulate gene expression in pre- and mature adipocytes in vitro. Moreover, we describe a novel methodological approach combining the activation of endogenous genes and siRNA-mediated gene silencing, thus providing a powerful tool to functionally decipher genetic factors controlling adipogenesis and adipocyte functions.

29029027	Microbial technologies often serve as the basis of fundamental research tools in molecular biology. These present a variety of ethical, legal and social issues concerning their patenting. This commentary presents several case studies of these issues across three major microbiological tools: CRISPR, viral vectors and antimicrobial resistance drugs. It concludes that the development of these technologies-both scientifically and commercially-depend, in part, on the patent regime available for each, and researchers' willingness to enforce those patents against others.

29028814	Helicobacter cinaedi is associated with nosocomial infections. The CRISPR-Cas system provides adaptive immunity against foreign genetic elements. We investigated the CRISPR-Cas system in H. cinaedi to assess the potential of the CRISPR-based microevolution of H. cinaedi strains. A genotyping method based on CRISPR spacer organization was carried out using 42 H. cinaedi strains. The results of sequence analysis showed that the H. cinaedi strains used in this study had two CRISPR loci (CRISPR1 and CRISPR2). The lengths of the consensus direct repeat sequences in CRISPR1 and CRISPR2 were both 36 bp-long, and 224 spacers were found in the 42 H. cinaedi strains. Analysis of the organization and sequence similarity of the spacers of the H. cinaedi strains showed that CRISPR arrays could be divided into 7 different genotypes. Each genotype had a different ancestral spacer, and spacer acquisition/deletion events occurred while isolates were spreading. Spacer polymorphisms of conserved arrays across the strains were instrumental for differentiating closely-related strains collected from the same hospital. MLST had little variability, while the CRISPR sequences showed remarkable diversity. Our data revealed the structural features of H. cinaedi CRISPR loci for the first time. CRISPR sequences constitute a valuable basis for genotyping, provide insights into the divergence and relatedness between closely-related strains, and reflect the microevolutionary process of H. cinaedi.

29028182	Viral sequence integration into the mammalian genome has long been perceived as a health risk. In some cases, integration translates to chronic viral infection, and in other instances, oncogenic gene mutations occur. However, research also shows that animal cells can benefit from integrated viral sequences (e.g., to support host cell development or to silence foreign invaders). Here we propose that, comparable with the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats that provide bacteria with adaptive immunity against invasive bacteriophages, animal cells may co-opt integrated viral sequences to support immune memory. We hypothesize that host cells express viral peptides from open reading frames in integrated sequences to boost adaptive B cell and T cell responses long after replicating viruses are cleared. In support of this hypothesis, we examine previous literature describing (1) viruses that infect acutely (e.g., vaccinia viruses and orthomyxoviruses) followed by unexplained, long-term persistence of viral nucleotide sequences, viral peptides, and virus-specific adaptive immunity, (2) the high frequency of endogenous viral genetic elements found in animal genomes, and (3) mechanisms with which animal host machinery supports foreign sequence integration.

29025062	As somatic cells in the testis seminiferous tubule, Sertoli cells provide the medium for spermatogenesis. One of the important functions of Sertoli cells is synthesizing and secreting cell factors to affect the production of sperm; however, much of those molecular regulation mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we confirm the localization of protein SPATA2 (spermatogenesis-associated protein 2), which had previously been shown to be highly expressed in Sertoli cells of the adult mouse testis. To further conduct a functional study, we generated SPATA2 global knockout mice via use of the CRISPR/Cas9n gene editing technology. The 120-day-old knockout mice testes showed almost a 40% decrease in size and weight and variations in the histomorphology of the seminiferous epithelium, with a 40% decrease in sperm count. Further examination revealed that the proliferation of germ cells in the seminiferous tubules was attenuated by 28%. In addition, we found that SPATA2 deletion led to an approximately 70% increase in the inhibin alpha-subunit mRNA and protein level in the testes compared to that of wild-type mice. Our data revealed the impact of SPATA2 on male fertility and suggested that SPATA2 ensures the normal secretory function of Sertoli cells.	J Zhao|J Zhao|G Xu|Z Wang|J Gao|S Cui|J Liu
29021376	The nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is a molecular platform that induces caspase-1 activation and subsequent IL-1β maturation, and is implicated in inflammatory diseases; however, little is known about the negative regulation of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In this article, we identified an E3 ligase, Ariadne homolog 2 (ARIH2), as a posttranslational negative regulator of NLRP3 inflammasome activity in macrophages. ARIH2 interacted with NLRP3 via its NACHT domain (aa 220-575) in the NLRP3 inflammasome complex. In particular, we found that while using mutants of ARIH2 and ubiquitin, the really interesting new gene 2 domain of ARIH2 was required for NLRP3 ubiquitination linked through K48 and K63. Deletion of endogenous ARIH2 using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing inhibited NLRP3 ubiquitination and promoted NLRP3 inflammasome activation, resulting in apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain oligomerization, pro-IL-1β processing, and IL-1β production. Conversely, ARIH2 overexpression promoted NLRP3 ubiquitination and inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism of ubiquitination-dependent negative regulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by ARIH2 and highlight ARIH2 as a potential therapeutic target for inflammatory diseases.

29021165	Targeted genome editing in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) is an attractive strategy for treating immunohematological diseases. However, the limited efficiency of homology-directed editing in primitive HSPCs constrains the yield of corrected cells and might affect the feasibility and safety of clinical translation. These concerns need to be addressed in stringent preclinical models and overcome by developing more efficient editing methods. We generated a humanized X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID-X1) mouse model and evaluated the efficacy and safety of hematopoietic reconstitution from limited input of functional HSPCs, establishing thresholds for full correction upon different types of conditioning. Unexpectedly, conditioning before HSPC infusion was required to protect the mice from lymphoma developing when transplanting small numbers of progenitors. We then designed a one-size-fits-all IL2RG (interleukin-2 receptor common γ-chain) gene correction strategy and, using the same reagents suitable for correction of human HSPC, validated the edited human gene in the disease model in vivo, providing evidence of targeted gene editing in mouse HSPCs and demonstrating the functionality of the IL2RG-edited lymphoid progeny. Finally, we optimized editing reagents and protocol for human HSPCs and attained the threshold of IL2RG editing in long-term repopulating cells predicted to safely rescue the disease, using clinically relevant HSPC sources and highly specific zinc finger nucleases or CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas9 (CRISPR-associated protein 9). Overall, our work establishes the rationale and guiding principles for clinical translation of SCID-X1 gene editing and provides a framework for developing gene correction for other diseases.

29016691	Goat's milk, considered a substitute for cow's milk, has a high nutritional value. However, goat's milk contains various allergens, predominantly β-lactoglobulin (BLG). In this study, we employed the CRISPR/Cas9 system to target the BLG locus in goat fibroblasts for sgRNA optimization and generate BLG knock-out goats through co-injection of Cas9 mRNA and small guide RNAs (sgRNAs) into goat embryos at the one-cell stage. We firstly tested sgRNA editing efficiencies in goat fibroblast cells, and approximately 8.00%-9.09% of the cells were modified in single sgRNA-guided targeting experiment. Among the kids, the genome-targeting efficiencies of single sgRNA were 12.5% (10 ng/μL sg1) and 0% (10 ng/μL sg2) and efficiencies of dual sgRNAs were 25.0% (25 ng/μL sg2+sg3 group) and 28.6% (50 ng/μL sg2+sg3 group). Relative expression of BLG in BLG knock-out goat mammary glands significantly (p < 0.01) decreased as well as other milk protein coding genes, such as CSN1S1, CSN1S2, CSN2, CSN3 and LALBA (p < 0.05). As expected, BLG protein had been abolished in the milk of the BLG knock-out goat. In addition, most of the targeted kids were chimeric (3/4), and their various body tissues were edited simultaneously. Our study thus provides a basis for optimizing the quality of goat milk, which can be applied to biomedical and agricultural research.	W Zhou|Y Wan|R Guo|M Deng|K Deng|Z Wang|Y Zhang|F Wang
28993659	It is important for probiotics that are currently utilized in the dairy industry to have clear genetic backgrounds. In this study, the genetic characteristics of Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens ZW3 were studied by undertaking a comparative genomics study, and key genes for adaptation to different environments were investigated and validated in vitro. Evidence for horizontal gene transfer resulting in strong self-defense mechanisms was detected in the ZW3 genome. We identified a series of genes relevant for dairy environments and the intestinal tract, particularly for extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) production. Reverse transcription-qPCR (RT-qPCR) revealed significant increases in the relative expression of pgm, ugp, and uge during the mid-logarithmic phase, whereas the expression of pgi was higher at the beginning of the stationary phase. The enzymes encoded by these four genes concertedly regulated carbon flux, which in turn modulated the production of EPS precursors. Moreover, ZW3 tolerated pH 3.5 and 3% bile salt and retained cell surface hydrophobicity and auto-aggregation. In conclusion, we explored the potential of ZW3 for utilization in both the dairy industry and in probiotic applications. Additionally, we elucidated the regulation of the relevant genes involved in EPS production.	Z Xing|W Geng|C Li|Y Sun|Y Wang

28992181	The Toll family of receptors sense microbial products and activate a defense response. The molecular machinery required for the TLR response is not yet fully understood. In the present study, we used a clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CAS9 screening system to study TLR responses. We employed a cell line expressing TLR with an NF-κB-driven GFP reporter. The cell line was transduced with a guide RNA (gRNA) library and stimulated with TLR ligands. The cells impaired in GFP induction were sorted, and gRNAs were sequenced. Identified genes were ranked according to the count of sequence reads and the number of gRNA target sites. The screening system worked correctly, as molecules that were already known to be required for the TLR response were identified by the screening. Furthermore, this system revealed that the oligosaccharide transferase complex (OSTC) mediating co-translational glycosylation was required for TLR5, 7 and 9 responses. Protein expression of TLR5, but not an irrelevant molecule (CD44), was abolished by the lack of OSTC, suggesting the essential role of glycosylation in TLR5 protein stability. These results demonstrate that the screening system established here is able to reveal molecular mechanisms underlying the TLR response.

28985512	The last decade has seen the fields of molecular biology and genetics transformed by the development of CRISPR-based gene editing technologies. These technologies were derived from bacterial defense systems that protect against viral invasion. Elegant studies focused on the evolutionary battle between CRISPR-encoding bacteria and the viruses that infect and kill them revealed the next step in this arms race, the anti-CRISPR proteins. Investigation of these proteins has provided important new insight into how CRISPR-Cas systems work and how bacterial genomes evolve. They have also led to the development of important biotechnological tools that can be used for genetic engineering, including off switches for CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing in human cells.	KL Maxwell
28985510	The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas nuclease system is a powerful tool for genome editing, and its simple programmability has enabled high-throughput genetic and epigenetic studies. These high-throughput approaches offer investigators a toolkit for functional interrogation of not only protein-coding genes but also noncoding DNA. Historically, noncoding DNA has lacked the detailed characterization that has been applied to protein-coding genes in large part because there has not been a robust set of methodologies for perturbing these regions. Although the majority of high-throughput CRISPR screens have focused on the coding genome to date, an increasing number of CRISPR screens targeting noncoding genomic regions continue to emerge. Here, we review high-throughput CRISPR-based approaches to uncover and understand functional elements within the noncoding genome and discuss practical aspects of noncoding library design and screen analysis.

28985508	The past several years have seen an explosion in development of applications for the CRISPR-Cas9 system, from efficient genome editing, to high-throughput screening, to recruitment of a range of DNA and chromatin-modifying enzymes. While homology-directed repair (HDR) coupled with Cas9 nuclease cleavage has been used with great success to repair and re-write genomes, recently developed base-editing systems present a useful orthogonal strategy to engineer nucleotide substitutions. Base editing relies on recruitment of cytidine deaminases to introduce changes (rather than double-stranded breaks and donor templates) and offers potential improvements in efficiency while limiting damage and simplifying the delivery of editing machinery. At the same time, these systems enable novel mutagenesis strategies to introduce sequence diversity for engineering and discovery. Here, we review the different base-editing platforms, including their deaminase recruitment strategies and editing outcomes, and compare them to other CRISPR genome-editing technologies. Additionally, we discuss how these systems have been applied in therapeutic, engineering, and research settings. Lastly, we explore future directions of this emerging technology.

28985507	The genome-wide perturbation of transcriptional networks with CRISPR-Cas technology has primarily involved systematic and targeted gene modulation. Here, we developed PRISM (Perturbing Regulatory Interactions by Synthetic Modulators), a screening platform that uses randomized CRISPR-Cas transcription factors (crisprTFs) to globally perturb transcriptional networks. By applying PRISM to a yeast model of Parkinson's disease (PD), we identified guide RNAs (gRNAs) that modulate transcriptional networks and protect cells from alpha-synuclein (αSyn) toxicity. One gRNA identified in this screen outperformed the most protective suppressors of αSyn toxicity reported previously, highlighting PRISM's ability to identify modulators of important phenotypes. Gene expression profiling revealed genes differentially modulated by this strong protective gRNA that rescued yeast from αSyn toxicity when overexpressed. Human homologs of top-ranked hits protected against αSyn-induced cell death in a human neuronal PD model. Thus, high-throughput and unbiased perturbation of transcriptional networks via randomized crisprTFs can reveal complex biological phenotypes and effective disease modulators.

28985502	CRISPR-Cas systems defend prokaryotes against bacteriophages and mobile genetic elements and serve as the basis for revolutionary tools for genetic engineering. Class 2 CRISPR-Cas systems use single Cas endonucleases paired with guide RNAs to cleave complementary nucleic acid targets, enabling programmable sequence-specific targeting with minimal machinery. Recent discoveries of previously unidentified CRISPR-Cas systems have uncovered a deep reservoir of potential biotechnological tools beyond the well-characterized Type II Cas9 systems. Here we review the current mechanistic understanding of newly discovered single-protein Cas endonucleases. Comparison of these Cas effectors reveals substantial mechanistic diversity, underscoring the phylogenetic divergence of related CRISPR-Cas systems. This diversity has enabled further expansion of CRISPR-Cas biotechnological toolkits, with wide-ranging applications from genome editing to diagnostic tools based on various Cas endonuclease activities. These advances highlight the exciting prospects for future tools based on the continually expanding set of CRISPR-Cas systems.	K Murugan|K Babu|R Sundaresan|R Rajan|DG Sashital
28982113	The transcriptional functions of the class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) HDAC1 and HDAC2 are mainly viewed as both repressive and redundant based on murine knockout studies, but they may have additional independent roles and their physiological functions in human cells are not as clearly defined. To address the individual epigenomic functions of HDAC2, here we utilized CRISPR-Cas9 to disrupt HDAC2 in human cells. We find that while HDAC2 null cells exhibited signs of cross-regulation between HDAC1 and HDAC2, specific epigenomic phenotypes were still apparent using RNA-seq and ChIP assays. We identified specific targets of HDAC2 repression, and defined a novel class of genes that are actively expressed in a partially HDAC2-dependent manner. While HDAC2 was required for the recruitment of HDAC1 to repressed HDAC2-gene targets, HDAC2 was dispensable for HDAC1 binding to HDAC2-activated targets, supporting the notion of distinct classes of targets. Both active and repressed classes of gene targets demonstrated enhanced histone acetylation and methylation in HDAC2-null cells. Binding of the HDAC1/2-associated SIN3A corepressor was altered at most HDAC2-targets, but without a clear pattern. Overall, our study defines two classes of HDAC2 targets in human cells, with a dependence of HDAC1 on HDAC2 at one class of targets, and distinguishes unique functions for HDAC2.

28981713	Interference with genes is the foundation of reverse genetics and is key to manipulation of living cells for biomedical and biotechnological applications. However, classical genetic knockout and transcriptional knockdown technologies have different drawbacks and offer no control over existing protein levels. Here, we describe an efficient genome editing approach that affects specific protein abundances by changing the rates of both RNA synthesis and protein degradation, based on the two cross-kingdom control mechanisms CRISPRi and the N-end rule for protein stability. In addition, our approach demonstrates that CRISPRi efficiency is dependent on endogenous gene expression levels. The method has broad applications in e.g. study of essential genes and antibiotics discovery.	V Martínez|I Lauritsen|T Hobel|S Li|AT Nielsen|MHH Nørholm
28976972	Gene drives have enormous potential for the control of insect populations of medical and agricultural relevance. By preferentially biasing their own inheritance, gene drives can rapidly introduce genetic traits even if these confer a negative fitness effect on the population. We have recently developed gene drives based on CRISPR nuclease constructs that are designed to disrupt key genes essential for female fertility in the malaria mosquito. The construct copies itself and the associated genetic disruption from one homologous chromosome to another during gamete formation, a process called homing that ensures the majority of offspring inherit the drive. Such drives have the potential to cause long-lasting, sustainable population suppression, though they are also expected to impose a large selection pressure for resistance in the mosquito. One of these population suppression gene drives showed rapid invasion of a caged population over 4 generations, establishing proof of principle for this technology. In order to assess the potential for the emergence of resistance to the gene drive in this population we allowed it to run for 25 generations and monitored the frequency of the gene drive over time. Following the initial increase of the gene drive we observed a gradual decrease in its frequency that was accompanied by the spread of small, nuclease-induced mutations at the target gene that are resistant to further cleavage and restore its functionality. Such mutations showed rates of increase consistent with positive selection in the face of the gene drive. Our findings represent the first documented example of selection for resistance to a synthetic gene drive and lead to important design recommendations and considerations in order to mitigate for resistance in future gene drive applications.

28974620	Transposon insertion sequencing (TIS) is a powerful high-throughput genetic technique that is transforming functional genomics in prokaryotes, because it enables genome-wide mapping of the determinants of fitness. However, current approaches for analyzing TIS data assume that selective pressures are constant over time and thus do not yield information regarding changes in the genetic requirements for growth in dynamic environments (e.g., during infection). Here, we describe structured analysis of TIS data collected as a time series, termed pattern analysis of conditional essentiality (PACE). From a temporal series of TIS data, PACE derives a quantitative assessment of each mutant's fitness over the course of an experiment and identifies mutants with related fitness profiles. In so doing, PACE circumvents major limitations of existing methodologies, specifically the need for artificial effect size thresholds and enumeration of bacterial population expansion. We used PACE to analyze TIS samples of Edwardsiella piscicida (a fish pathogen) collected over a 2-week infection period from a natural host (the flatfish turbot). PACE uncovered more genes that affect E. piscicida's fitness in vivo than were detected using a cutoff at a terminal sampling point, and it identified subpopulations of mutants with distinct fitness profiles, one of which informed the design of new live vaccine candidates. Overall, PACE enables efficient mining of time series TIS data and enhances the power and sensitivity of TIS-based analyses.IMPORTANCE Transposon insertion sequencing (TIS) enables genome-wide mapping of the genetic determinants of fitness, typically based on observations at a single sampling point. Here, we move beyond analysis of endpoint TIS data to create a framework for analysis of time series TIS data, termed pattern analysis of conditional essentiality (PACE). We applied PACE to identify genes that contribute to colonization of a natural host by the fish pathogen Edwardsiella piscicida. PACE uncovered more genes that affect E. piscicida's fitness in vivo than were detected using a terminal sampling point, and its clustering of mutants with related fitness profiles informed design of new live vaccine candidates. PACE yields insights into patterns of fitness dynamics and circumvents major limitations of existing methodologies. Finally, the PACE method should be applicable to additional "omic" time series data, including screens based on clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats with Cas9 (CRISPR/Cas9).

28973931	G protein stimulatory α-subunit (Gαs)-coupled heptahelical receptors regulate cell processes largely through activation of protein kinase A (PKA). To identify signaling processes downstream of PKA, we deleted both PKA catalytic subunits using CRISPR-Cas9, followed by a "multiomic" analysis in mouse kidney epithelial cells expressing the Gαs-coupled V2 vasopressin receptor. RNA-seq (sequencing)-based transcriptomics and SILAC (stable isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture)-based quantitative proteomics revealed a complete loss of expression of the water-channel gene Aqp2 in PKA knockout cells. SILAC-based quantitative phosphoproteomics identified 229 PKA phosphorylation sites. Most of these PKA targets are thus far unannotated in public databases. Surprisingly, 1,915 phosphorylation sites with the motif x-(S/T)-P showed increased phosphooccupancy, pointing to increased activity of one or more MAP kinases in PKA knockout cells. Indeed, phosphorylation changes associated with activation of ERK2 were seen in PKA knockout cells. The ERK2 site is downstream of a direct PKA site in the Rap1GAP, Sipa1l1, that indirectly inhibits Raf1. In addition, a direct PKA site that inhibits the MAP kinase kinase kinase Map3k5 (ASK1) is upstream of JNK1 activation. The datasets were integrated to identify a causal network describing PKA signaling that explains vasopressin-mediated regulation of membrane trafficking and gene transcription. The model predicts that, through PKA activation, vasopressin stimulates AQP2 exocytosis by inhibiting MAP kinase signaling. The model also predicts that, through PKA activation, vasopressin stimulates Aqp2 transcription through induction of nuclear translocation of the acetyltransferase EP300, which increases histone H3K27 acetylation of vasopressin-responsive genes (confirmed by ChIP-seq).

28973645	The recent generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from a patient with Parkinson's disease (PD) resulting from triplication of the α-synuclein (SNCA) gene locus allows unprecedented opportunities to explore its contribution to the molecular pathogenesis of PD. We used the double-nicking CRISPR/Cas9 system to conduct site-specific mutagenesis of SNCA in these cells, generating an isogenic iPSC line with normalized SNCA gene dosage. Comparative gene expression analysis of neuronal derivatives from these iPSCs revealed an ER stress phenotype, marked by induction of the IRE1α/XBP1 axis of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and culminating in terminal UPR activation. Neuropathological analysis of post-mortem brain tissue demonstrated that pIRE1α is expressed in PD brains within neurons containing elevated levels of α-synuclein or Lewy bodies. Having used this pair of isogenic iPSCs to define this phenotype, these cells can be further applied in UPR-targeted drug discovery towards the development of disease-modifying therapeutics.

28973003	Osteoclasts are large multinucleated cells responsible for bone resorption. Excessive inflammatory activation of osteoclasts leads to bony erosions, which are the hallmark of several diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Salt-inducible kinases (SIK) constitute a subfamily of kinases comprising three members (SIK1, -2, and -3). Inhibition of SIK kinase activity induces an anti-inflammatory phenotype in macrophages. Since osteoclasts originate from precursors of macrophage origin, we hypothesized a role of SIK in osteoclastogenesis. We analyzed SIK1, -2 and -3 expression and function in osteoclast differentiation using the mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7 and bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM). We show that all three SIK are expressed in fully differentiated osteoclasts and that in BMM-derived osteoclasts there is an increased expression of SIK1 and SIK3 proteins. Interestingly, the pan-SIK inhibitor HG-9-91-01 significantly inhibited osteoclastogenesis by dose dependently reducing osteoclast differentiation markers (i.e. CathepsinK, MMP-9 and TRAP) and bone resorbing activity. Analysis of the signaling pathways activated by RANKL in RAW cells showed that SIK inhibitors did not affect RANKL-induced ERK1/2, JNK, p38 or NF-κB activation, but induced a significant downregulation in c-Fos and NFATc1 protein levels, the two main transcription factors involved in the regulation of osteoclast-specific genes. Moreover, SIK inhibition partially increased the proteasome-mediated degradation of c-Fos. SIK2 and SIK3 knockout RAW cells were generated by the CRISPR/Cas9 approach. SIK2 KO and, to a lesser extent, SIK3 KO recapitulated the effect of SIK small molecule inhibitor, thus confirming the specificity of the effect of SIK inhibition on the reduction of osteoclastogenesis. Overall, our results support the notion that the SIK signaling pathway plays a significant role among the check-points controlling osteoclastogenesis. SIK kinase inhibitors could thus represent a potential novel therapy to prevent bone erosions.	MS Lombardi|C Gilliéron|M Berkelaar|C Gabay
28971351	We previously constructed a herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) UL7 mutant virus (M1) and showed that a partial deletion mutation of the UL7 gene led to a lower proliferative rate and an attenuated phenotype. Using the M1 mutant, we further modified the UL41 gene, which encodes another tegument protein, and the latency-associated transcript (LAT) gene. Observations of the resulting mutants with modified UL7 and UL41 (M2) or UL7, UL41 and LAT (M3) genes indicated attenuated phenotypes, with lower proliferative ratios in various cells, non-lethal infections in mice and lower viral loads in nervous tissues compared with the wild-type strain. Furthermore, no LAT stable intron could be detected in the trigeminal ganglion of M3-infected animals. The results obtained with the three HSV-1 mutants indicate that the M3 mutant is an attenuated strain with low pathogenicity during both acute and latent infections. Together, the results support the use of the M3 mutant as a candidate for the development of an HSV-1 vaccine.	X Xu|Y Guo|S Fan|P Cui|M Feng|L Wang|Y Zhang|Y Liao|X Zhang|Q Li

28967920	Treating KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains a major challenge in cancer treatment given the difficulties associated with directly inhibiting the KRAS oncoprotein. One approach to addressing this challenge is to define mutations that frequently co-occur with those in KRAS, which themselves may lead to therapeutic vulnerabilities in tumors. Approximately 20% of KRAS-mutant LUAD tumors carry loss-of-function mutations in the KEAP1 gene encoding Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (refs. 2, 3, 4), a negative regulator of nuclear factor erythroid 2-like 2 (NFE2L2; hereafter NRF2), which is the master transcriptional regulator of the endogenous antioxidant response. The high frequency of mutations in KEAP1 suggests an important role for the oxidative stress response in lung tumorigenesis. Using a CRISPR-Cas9-based approach in a mouse model of KRAS-driven LUAD, we examined the effects of Keap1 loss in lung cancer progression. We show that loss of Keap1 hyperactivates NRF2 and promotes KRAS-driven LUAD in mice. Through a combination of CRISPR-Cas9-based genetic screening and metabolomic analyses, we show that Keap1- or Nrf2-mutant cancers are dependent on increased glutaminolysis, and this property can be therapeutically exploited through the pharmacological inhibition of glutaminase. Finally, we provide a rationale for stratification of human patients with lung cancer harboring KRAS/KEAP1- or KRAS/NRF2-mutant lung tumors as likely to respond to glutaminase inhibition.

28964699	Multiple regulatory regions have the potential to regulate a single gene, yet how these elements combine to affect gene expression remains unclear. To uncover the combinatorial relationships between enhancers, we developed Enhancer-interference (Enhancer-i), a CRISPR interference-based approach that uses 2 different repressive domains, KRAB and SID, to prevent enhancer activation simultaneously at multiple regulatory regions. We applied Enhancer-i to promoter-distal estrogen receptor α binding sites (ERBS), which cluster around estradiol-responsive genes and therefore may collaborate to regulate gene expression. Targeting individual sites revealed predominant ERBS that are completely required for the transcriptional response, indicating a lack of redundancy. Simultaneous interference of different ERBS combinations identified supportive ERBS that contribute only when predominant sites are active. Using mathematical modeling, we find strong evidence for collaboration between predominant and supportive ERBS. Overall, our findings expose a complex functional hierarchy of enhancers, where multiple loci bound by the same transcription factor combine to fine-tune the expression of target genes.

28961272	SORBS2 is a scaffolding protein associated with Abl/Arg non-receptor tyrosine kinase pathways and is known to interact with actin and several other cytoskeletal proteins in various cell types. Previous BioID proximity labeling of tight and adherens junction proteins suggested that SORBS2 is a component of the apical junction complex of epithelial cells. We asked whether SORBS2 plays a previously unappreciated role in controlling perijunctional actin and tight junction barrier function. Using super resolution imaging we confirmed that SORBS2 is localized at the apical junction complex but farther from the membrane than ZO-1 and located partially overlapping both the tight- and adherens junctions with a periodic concentration that alternates with myosin IIB in polarized epithelial cells. Overexpression of GFP-SORBS2 recruited alpha-actinin, vinculin and N-WASP, and possibly CIP4 to cellular junctions. However, CRISPR-Cas9 knock-out of SORBS2 did not alter the localization- or immunofluorescent staining intensity of these or several other junctional- and cytoskeletal proteins. SORBS2 knock-out also did not affect the barrier function as measured by TER and dextran flux; nor did it change actin-dependent junction re-assembly as measured by Ca2+-switch and Latrunculin-B wash-out assays. The kinetics of HGF-induced cell scattering and wound healing, and dextran flux increase induced by PDGF also were unaffected by SORBS2 knock-out. SORBS2 concentrates with apical junctional actin that accumulates in response to knock-down of ZO-1 and ZO-2. In spite of our finding that SORBS2 is clearly a component of the apical junction complex, it does not appear to be required for either normal tight- or adherens junction assembly, structure or function or for growth factor-mediated changes in tight junction dynamics.

28958990	Bortezomib is highly effective in the treatment of multiple myeloma; however, emergent drug resistance is common. Consequently, we employed CRISPR targeting 19,052 human genes to identify unbiased targets that contribute to bortezomib resistance. Specifically, we engineered an RPMI8226 multiple myeloma cell line to express Cas9 infected by lentiviral vector CRISPR library and cultured derived cells in doses of bortezomib lethal to parental cells. Sequencing was performed on surviving cells to identify inactivated genes responsible for drug resistance. From two independent whole-genome screens, we selected 31 candidate genes and constructed a second CRISPR sgRNA library, specifically targeting each of these 31 genes with four sgRNAs. After secondary screening for bortezomib resistance, the top 20 "resistance" genes were selected for individual validation. Of these 20 targets, the proteasome regulatory subunit PSMC6 was the only gene validated to reproducibly confer bortezomib resistance. We confirmed that inhibition of chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity by bortezomib was significantly reduced in cells lacking PSMC6. We individually investigated other members of the PSMC group (PSMC1 to 5) and found that deficiency in each of those subunits also imparts bortezomib resistance. We found 36 mutations in 19S proteasome subunits out of 895 patients in the IA10 release of the CoMMpass study (https://themmrf.org).

28956384	To study the biological function of DNAH2 (Homo sapiens dynein, axonemal, heavy chain 2) gene, we constructed human stable U2OS cell line of DNAH2 gene knockout through CRISPR/Cas9n double nick system. The A, B sgRNAs (Single guide RNA) and complementary strands were designed and synthesized. The double-stranded structures were formed during annealing, and connected with BbsⅠ cohesive ends-containing pX462 linear vector to construct the recombinant eukaryotic expression plasmids, including pX462-DNAH2-A and pX462-DNAH2-B. After the co-transfection of the two plasmids into U2OS cells, the addition of puromycin and limiting dilution method were used to obtain positive monoclonal cell line. Western blotting assay was then performed to detect the expression of DNAH2 protein, and PCR-sequencing technology was finally utilized to analyze the mutation feature. The results showed that A, B sgRNAs duplex was successfully inserted into pX462 vector, and DNAH2 protein was not expressed and DNAH2 gene suffered from the frame-shift mutation in U2OS-DNAH2-KO monoclonal cell line. These demonstrated that DNAH2 knockout U2OS stable cell line was successfully constructed through CRISPR/Cas9n double nick system, which providing a useful tool for the study of DNAH2 gene.	基于CRISPR/Cas9n double nick 技术构建人DNAH2 (Homo sapiens dynein, axonemal, heavy chain 2) 基因敲除的U2OS 稳定细胞株，旨在研究DNAH2 基因的生物学功能。首先设计并合成A、B 两个sgRNA (Single guide RNA) 以及各自的互补链，退火连接形成DNAH2 sgRNA-A、B 双链，再分别与带有BbsⅠ粘性末端的pX462 线性载体相连，形成pX462-DNAH2-A、pX462-DNAH2-B 重组真核表达质粒。质粒共转染至U2OS 细胞后，加入嘌呤霉素，以有限稀释法获得阳性单克隆细胞株，再以蛋白印迹实验检测DNAH2 蛋白的表达，最后通过PCR-基因测序技术分析突变特点。结果显示A、B sgRNA 双链成功插入pX462 载体，U2OS-DNAH2-KO单克隆细胞株中DNAH2 蛋白不表达，DNAH2 基因发生移码突变，从而证实利用CRISPR/Cas9n double nick系统成功构建人DNAH2 基因敲除的U2OS 稳定细胞株，为研究DNAH2 基因提供有利工具。.

28945252	The challenge of linking intergenic mutations to target genes has limited molecular understanding of human diseases. Here we show that H3K27ac HiChIP generates high-resolution contact maps of active enhancers and target genes in rare primary human T cell subtypes and coronary artery smooth muscle cells. Differentiation of naive T cells into T helper 17 cells or regulatory T cells creates subtype-specific enhancer-promoter interactions, specifically at regions of shared DNA accessibility. These data provide a principled means of assigning molecular functions to autoimmune and cardiovascular disease risk variants, linking hundreds of noncoding variants to putative gene targets. Target genes identified with HiChIP are further supported by CRISPR interference and activation at linked enhancers, by the presence of expression quantitative trait loci, and by allele-specific enhancer loops in patient-derived primary cells. The majority of disease-associated enhancers contact genes beyond the nearest gene in the linear genome, leading to a fourfold increase in the number of potential target genes for autoimmune and cardiovascular diseases.

28941336	Almost all archaea and many bacteria achieve adaptive immunity through a diverse set of CRISPR-Cas systems. From 2012, Cas9 has been harnessed by thousands of laboratories for genome editing applications in a variety of experimental model systems. Cas9 is driving innovative applications from basic biology to biotechnology and medicine. However, numerous challenges still remain, such as limited targeting range, toxicity, and potential for off-target mutagenesis. Cpf1 represents a class 2/type V CRISPR RNA-guided endonuclease that is distinct from the type II CRISPR Cas9 nuclease. Future exploration of strategies using Cpf1 is expected to bring solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing genome editing. Here, we review the development and applications of Cpf1 for a variety of research or applications, and highlight challenges as well as future directions.

28940390	G-quadruplex structures in the 5' UTR of mRNAs have been shown to suppress translation. However, all experiments published so far made use of artificial reporter systems. Here, we investigate for the first time the biological effects of the genomic disruption of a G-quadruplex by CRISPR/Cas9. In melanoma cells lacking the G-quadruplex-forming sequence in the mRNA of the apoptosis inhibitor Bcl-2, the protein level of Bcl-2 remains virtually unchanged. Consequently, sensitivity to an inducer of apoptosis is not reduced. Thus, it is likely that the inhibitory effects of G-quadruplexes observed to date were more pronounced due to the use of the strong overexpression in transfection experiments, whereas G-quadruplexes in endogenous mRNAs, expressed at moderate levels, are widely resolved by cellular RNA helicases.

28940345	In this pivotal year for gene editing, the breakthrough molecular system CRISPR-Cas9 has advanced on three fronts. In under seven months, an influential scientific body-the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine-cracked open the door to human germline gene editing, ownership of patents covering CRISPR-Cas9 came into much sharper focus as a result of a dispute between two parties, and experiments showing proof of concept of the most controversial of uses-altering germlines of humans-were revealed as having been successfully performed by a mainstream laboratory. Given the vast spoils that await the patent owners, final results of all patent disputes over CRISPR-Cas9 patents may stretch on for years. Meanwhile, bioethical considerations of CRISPR-Cas9 have also been contentious as the United States and other countries grapple with how best to regulate gene editing.	AW Torrance
28938163	Osteosarcoma (OS) is a highly aggressive pediatric cancer, characterized by frequent lung metastasis and pathologic bone destruction. Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), highly expressed in OS, not only contributes to angiogenesis within the tumor microenvironment via paracrine stimulation of vascular endothelial cells, but also acts as an autocrine survival factor for tumor cell themselves, thus making it a promising therapeutic target for OS. CRISPR/Cas9 is a versatile genome editing technology and holds tremendous promise for cancer treatment. However, a major bottleneck to achieve the therapeutic potential of the CRISPR/Cas9 is the lack of in vivo tumor-targeted delivery systems. Here, we screened an OS cell-specific aptamer (LC09) and developed a LC09-functionalized PEG-PEI-Cholesterol (PPC) lipopolymer encapsulating CRISPR/Cas9 plasmids encoding VEGFA gRNA and Cas9. Our results demonstrated that LC09 facilitated selective distribution of CRISPR/Cas9 in both orthotopic OS and lung metastasis, leading to effective VEGFA genome editing in tumor, decreased VEGFA expression and secretion, inhibited orthotopic OS malignancy and lung metastasis, as well as reduced angiogenesis and bone lesion with no detectable toxicity. The delivery system simultaneously restrained autocrine and paracrine VEGFA signaling in tumor cells and could facilitate translating CRISPR-Cas9 into clinical cancer treatment.

28937992	A protocol for the induction of site-directed deletions and insertions in the genome of Brassica carinata with CRISPR is described. The construct containing the Cas9 nuclease and the guide RNA (gRNA) was delivered by the hairy root transformation technique, and a successful transformation was monitored by GFP fluorescence. PAGE analysis of an amplified region, presumably containing the deletions and insertions, demonstrated up to seven different indels in one transgenic root and in all analyzed roots a wildtype allele of the modified gene was not detectable. Interestingly, many of these mutations consisted of relatively large indels with up to 112 bp. The exact size of the deletions was determined to allow an estimation whether the targeted gene was not functional due to a considerable deletion or a frame shift within the open reading frame. This allowed a direct phenotypic assessment of the previously characterized roots and, in fact, deletions in FASCICLIN-LIKE ARABINOGALACTAN PROTEIN 1 (BcFLA1)-a gene with an expression pattern consistent with a role in root hair architecture-resulted in shorter root hairs compared to control roots ectopically expressing an allele of the gene that cannot be targeted by the gRNA in parallel to the CRISPR construct. As an additional line of evidence, we monitored BcFLA1 expression with qPCR and detected a significant reduction of the transcript in roots with an active CRISPR construct compared to the control, although residual amounts of the transcript were detected, possibly due to inefficient nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Additionally, the presence of deletions and insertions were verified by Sanger sequencing of the respective amplicons. In summary we demonstrate the successful application of CRISPR/Cas9 in hairy roots of B. carinata, the proof of its effectiveness and its effect on the root hair phenotype. This study paves the way for experimental strategies involving the phenotypic assessment of gene lesions by CRISPR which do not require germline transmission.

28934361	Prevotella intermedia, a major periodontal pathogen, is increasingly implicated in human respiratory tract and cystic fibrosis lung infections. Nevertheless, the specific mechanisms employed by this pathogen remain only partially characterized and poorly understood, largely due to its total lack of genetic accessibility. Here, using Single Molecule, Real-Time (SMRT) genome and methylome sequencing, bisulfite sequencing, in addition to cloning and restriction analysis, we define the specific genetic barriers to exogenous DNA present in two of the most widespread laboratory strains, P. intermedia ATCC 25611 and P. intermedia Strain 17. We identified and characterized multiple restriction-modification (R-M) systems, some of which are considerably divergent between the two strains. We propose that these R-M systems are the root cause of the P. intermedia transformation barrier. Additionally, we note the presence of conserved Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeat (CRISPR) systems in both strains, which could provide a further barrier to exogenous DNA uptake and incorporation. This work will provide a valuable resource during the development of a genetic system for P. intermedia, which will be required for fundamental investigation of this organism's physiology, metabolism, and pathogenesis in human disease.

28928211	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and CRISPR-associated protein (CRISPR-Cas) systems store the memory of past encounters with foreign DNA in unique spacers that are inserted between direct repeats in CRISPR arrays. For only a small fraction of the spacers, homologous sequences, called protospacers, are detectable in viral, plasmid, and microbial genomes. The rest of the spacers remain the CRISPR "dark matter." We performed a comprehensive analysis of the spacers from all CRISPR-cas loci identified in bacterial and archaeal genomes, and we found that, depending on the CRISPR-Cas subtype and the prokaryotic phylum, protospacers were detectable for 1% to about 19% of the spacers (~7% global average). Among the detected protospacers, the majority, typically 80 to 90%, originated from viral genomes, including proviruses, and among the rest, the most common source was genes that are integrated into microbial chromosomes but are involved in plasmid conjugation or replication. Thus, almost all spacers with identifiable protospacers target mobile genetic elements (MGE). The GC content, as well as dinucleotide and tetranucleotide compositions, of microbial genomes, their spacer complements, and the cognate viral genomes showed a nearly perfect correlation and were almost identical. Given the near absence of self-targeting spacers, these findings are most compatible with the possibility that the spacers, including the dark matter, are derived almost completely from the species-specific microbial mobilomes.IMPORTANCE The principal function of CRISPR-Cas systems is thought to be protection of bacteria and archaea against viruses and other parasitic genetic elements. The CRISPR defense function is mediated by sequences from parasitic elements, known as spacers, that are inserted into CRISPR arrays and then transcribed and employed as guides to identify and inactivate the cognate parasitic genomes. However, only a small fraction of the CRISPR spacers match any sequences in the current databases, and of these, only a minority correspond to known parasitic elements. We show that nearly all spacers with matches originate from viral or plasmid genomes that are either free or have been integrated into the host genome. We further demonstrate that spacers with no matches have the same properties as those of identifiable origins, strongly suggesting that all spacers originate from mobile elements.

28923495	Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FL-HCC) is a primary liver cancer that predominantly affects children and young adults with no underlying liver disease. A somatic, 400 Kb deletion on chromosome 19 that fuses part of the DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member B1 gene (DNAJB1) to the protein kinase cAMP-activated catalytic subunit alpha gene (PRKACA) has been repeatedly identified in patients with FL-HCC. However, the DNAJB1-PRKACA gene fusion has not been shown to induce liver tumorigenesis. We used the CRISPR/Cas9 technique to delete in mice the syntenic region on chromosome 8 to create a Dnajb1-Prkaca fusion and monitored the mice for liver tumor development.	We delivered CRISPR/Cas9 vectors designed to juxtapose exon 1 of Dnajb1 with exon 2 of Prkaca to create the Dnajb1-Prkaca gene fusion associated with FL-HCC, or control Cas9 vector, via hydrodynamic tail vein injection to livers of 8-week-old female FVB/N mice. These mice did not have any other engineered genetic alterations and were not exposed to liver toxins or carcinogens. Liver tissues were collected 14 months after delivery; genomic DNA was analyzed by PCR to detect the Dnajb1-Prkaca fusion, and tissues were characterized by histology, immunohistochemistry, RNA sequencing, and whole-exome sequencing.	Livers from 12 of the 15 mice given the vectors to induce the Dnajb1-Prkaca gene fusion, but none of the 11 mice given the control vector, developed neoplasms. The tumors contained the Dnajb1-Prkaca gene fusion and had histologic and cytologic features of human FL-HCCs: large polygonal cells with granular, eosinophilic, and mitochondria-rich cytoplasm, prominent nucleoli, and markers of hepatocytes and cholangiocytes. In comparing expression levels of genes between the mouse tumor and non-tumor liver cells, we identified changes similar to those detected in human FL-HCC, which included genes that affect cell cycle and mitosis regulation. Genomic analysis of mouse neoplasms induced by the Dnajb1-Prkaca fusion revealed a lack of mutations in genes commonly associated with liver cancers, as observed in human FL-HCC.	Using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we found generation of the Dnajb1-Prkaca fusion gene in wild-type mice to be sufficient to initiate formation of tumors that have many features of human FL-HCC. Strategies to block DNAJB1-PRKACA might be developed as therapeutics for this form of liver cancer.	LH Engelholm|A Riaz|D Serra|F Dagnæs-Hansen|JV Johansen|E Santoni-Rugiu|SH Hansen|F Niola|M Frödin
28920958	N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is an abundant nucleotide modification in mRNA that is required for the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells. However, it remains unknown whether the m6A modification controls the differentiation of normal and/or malignant myeloid hematopoietic cells. Here we show that shRNA-mediated depletion of the m6A-forming enzyme METTL3 in human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) promotes cell differentiation, coupled with reduced cell proliferation. Conversely, overexpression of wild-type METTL3, but not of a catalytically inactive form of METTL3, inhibits cell differentiation and increases cell growth. METTL3 mRNA and protein are expressed more abundantly in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells than in healthy HSPCs or other types of tumor cells. Furthermore, METTL3 depletion in human myeloid leukemia cell lines induces cell differentiation and apoptosis and delays leukemia progression in recipient mice in vivo. Single-nucleotide-resolution mapping of m6A coupled with ribosome profiling reveals that m6A promotes the translation of c-MYC, BCL2 and PTEN mRNAs in the human acute myeloid leukemia MOLM-13 cell line. Moreover, loss of METTL3 leads to increased levels of phosphorylated AKT, which contributes to the differentiation-promoting effects of METTL3 depletion. Overall, these results provide a rationale for the therapeutic targeting of METTL3 in myeloid leukemia.

28918173	Within the short few years since the report of its application in precise genome editing, CRISPR technology has become the method of choice to modify and modulate gene expression in biomedical research and therapeutic development. Subsequently, a variety of research, diagnostic, and therapeutic tools have been developed based upon CRISPR's mechanism of action. Such tools have helped to deepen the understanding of fundamental biology and broaden the horizon in the search for treatments for diseases that have been considered hard or impossible to cure. As CRISPR technology advances closer to clinical applications, its short comings are becoming more apparent, thus creating opportunities to improve the technology's efficacy, specificity, and safety profile in this setting. We will summarize the current status of CRISPR technology and discuss its future impact in this review.	PJ Collins|CM Hale|H Xu
28917552	Mutations in the PRKAG2 gene encoding the γ-subunit of adenosine monophosphate kinase (AMPK) cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and familial Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. Patients carrying the R302Q mutation in PRKAG2 present with sinus bradycardia, escape rhythms, ventricular preexcitation, supraventricular tachycardia, and atrioventricular block. This mutation affects AMPK activity and increases glycogen storage in cardiomyocytes. The link between glycogen storage, WPW syndrome, HCM, and arrhythmias remains unknown.	The purpose of this study was to investigate the pathological changes caused by the PRKAG2 mutation. We tested the hypothesis that patient's induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) display clinical aspects of the disease.	Using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) technology, we corrected the mutation and then generated isogenic iPSC-CMs. Action potentials were recorded from spontaneously firing and paced cardiomyocytes using the patch clamp technique. Using a microelectrode array setup, we recorded electrograms from iPSC-CMs clusters. Transmission electron microscopy was used to detect ultrastructural abnormalities in the mutated iPSC-CMs.	PRKAG2-mutated iPSC-CMs exhibited abnormal firing patterns, delayed afterdepolarizations, triggered arrhythmias, and augmented beat rate variability. Importantly, CRISPR correction eliminated the electrophysiological abnormalities, the augmented glycogen, storage, and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.	PRKAG2-mutated iPSC-CMs displayed functional and structural abnormalities, which were abolished by correcting the mutation in the patient's iPSCs using CRISPR technology.

28912455	The ETS transcription factor Etv2 is necessary and sufficient for the generation of hematopoietic and endothelial cells. However, upstream regulators of Etv2 in hemangiogenesis, generation of hematopoietic and endothelial cells, have not been clearly addressed. Here we track the developmental route of hemangiogenic progenitors from mouse embryonic stem cells, perform genome-wide CRISPR screening, and transcriptome analysis of en route cell populations by utilizing Brachyury, Etv2, or Scl reporter embryonic stem cell lines to further understand the mechanisms that control hemangiogenesis. We identify the forkhead transcription factor Foxh1, in part through Eomes, to be critical for the formation of FLK1+ mesoderm, from which the hemangiogenic fate is specified. Importantly, hemangiogenic fate is specified not simply by the onset of Etv2 expression, but by a threshold-dependent mechanism, in which VEGF-FLK1 signaling plays an instructive role by promoting Etv2 threshold expression. These studies reveal comprehensive cellular and molecular pathways governing the hemangiogenic cell lineage development.How haematopoietic and endothelial cell lineages are specified is unclear. Here, the authors identify the forkhead transcription factor Foxh1 as regulating FLK1+ mesoderm formation in mouse embryonic stem cells, which in turn specifies hemangiogenic fate via Etv2.

28911114	CRISPR-Cas system provides the adaptive immunity against invading genetic elements in prokaryotes. Recently, we demonstrated that Csa3a regulator mediates spacer acquisition in Sulfolobus islandicus by activating the expression of Type I-A adaptation cas genes. However, links between the activation of spacer adaptation and CRISPR transcription/processing, and the requirement for DNA repair genes during spacer acquisition remained poorly understood. Here, we demonstrated that de novo spacer acquisition required Csa1, Cas1, Cas2 and Cas4 proteins of the Sulfolobus Type I-A system. Disruption of genes implicated in crRNA maturation or DNA interference led to a significant accumulation of acquired spacers, mainly derived from host genomic DNA. Transcriptome and proteome analyses showed that Csa3a activated expression of adaptation cas genes, CRISPR RNAs, and DNA repair genes, including herA helicase, nurA nuclease and DNA polymerase II genes. Importantly, Csa3a specifically bound the promoters of the above DNA repair genes, suggesting that they were directly activated by Csa3a for adaptation. The Csa3a regulator also specifically bound to the leader sequence to activate CRISPR transcription in vivo. Our data indicated that the Csa3a regulator couples transcriptional activation of the CRISPR-Cas system and DNA repair genes for spacer adaptation and efficient interference of invading genetic elements.

In this issue of Cell Host & Microbe, Pyenson et al. (2017) show that the lack of a PAM requirement in some CRISPR-Cas systems prevents interference evasion and facilitates phage extinction.

28903753	Avian leukosis virus (ALV) is a retrovirus that causes tumors in avian species, and its vertical and horizontal transmission in poultry flocks results in enormous economic losses. Despite the discovery of specific host receptors, there have been few reports on the modulation of viral susceptibility via genetic modification. We therefore engineered acquired resistance to ALV subgroup B using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing technology in DF-1 chicken fibroblasts. Using this method, we efficiently modified the tumor virus locus B (tvb) gene, encoding the TVB receptor, which is essential for ALV subgroup B entry into host cells. By expanding individual DF-1 clones, we established that artificially generated premature stop codons in the cysteine-rich domain (CRD) of TVB receptor confer resistance to ALV subgroup B. Furthermore, we found that a cysteine residue (C80) of CRD2 plays a crucial role in ALV subgroup B entry. These results suggest that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing can be used to efficiently modify avian cells and establish novel chicken cell lines with resistance to viral infection.

28903573	In the recent years, there was a remarkable advance in research and clinical implementation of the genome editing technologies. The most remarkable was a discovery of the bacterial adaptive immune system called CRISPR and its rapid transformation into a robust and broadly applicable technology that completely revolutionized both basic and applied biomedical research. Implementation of CRISPR makes genome modification easier, faster and significantly cheaper compare to any other currently available technology. It also offers a tremendous potential for desiging novel research approaches and future treatment options for various genetic diseases including multiple myeloma. The hightroughput use of CRISPR in pooled screen formats promises faster identification and validation of valuable drug targets together with revealing high-confidence biomarkers and unknown resistance mechanisms. This can provide clinicians with new diagnostic and prognostic tolls and ultimately allow more accurate patient stratification for personalised treatment with better eficacy. In this review, we summarize current knowledge about the CRISPR technology and focus especially on its impact in exploring gene functions, screening for novel drug targets, diagnostic markers and genes involved in resistance to commonly used drug in the treatment of multiple myeloma. Finally, we also highlight a potential future use of CRISPR in actual clinical practise.Key words: multiple myeloma - CRISPR - therapeutics.	M M Simicek|K Growkova|R Hájek
28900076	The discovery of CRISPR/Cas9 brought a hope for having an efficient, reliable, and readily available tool for genome editing. CRISPR/Cas9 is certainly easy to use, while its efficiency and reliability remain the focus of studies. The review describes the general principles of the organization and function of Cas nucleases and a number of important issues to be considered while planning genome editing experiments with CRISPR/Cas9. The issues include evaluation of the efficiency and specificity for Cas9, sgRNA selection, Cas9 variants designed artificially, and use of homologous recombination and nonhomologous end joining in DNA editing.

28899753	Avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J), first isolated in the late 1980s, has caused economic losses to the poultry industry in many countries. As all chicken lines studied to date are susceptible to ALV infection, there is enormous interest in developing resistant chicken lines. The ALV-J receptor, chicken Na+/H+ exchange 1 (chNHE1) and the critical amino acid sequences involved in viral attachment and entry have already been characterized. However, there are no reported attempts to induce resistance to the virus by targeted genome modification of the receptor sequences. In an attempt to induce resistance to ALV-J infection, we used clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated (CRISPR/Cas9)-based genome editing approaches to modify critical residues of the chNHE1 receptor in chicken cells. The susceptibility of the modified cell lines to ALV-J infection was examined using enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-expressing marker viruses. We showed that modifying the chNHE1 receptor by artificially generating a premature stop codon induced absolute resistance to viral infection, with mutations of the tryptophan residue at position 38 (Trp38) being very critical. Single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (ssODN)-mediated targeted recombination of the Trp38 region revealed that deletions involving the Trp38 residue were most effective in conferring resistance to ALV-J. Moreover, protein structure analysis of the chNHE1 receptor sequence suggested that its intrinsically disordered region undergoes local conformational changes through genetic alteration. Collectively, these results demonstrate that targeted mutations on chNHE1 alter the susceptibility to ALV-J and the technique is expected to contribute to develop disease-resistant chicken lines.

28893837	The CRISPR-Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat-CRISPR-associated protein) system is unique to prokaryotes and provides the majority of bacteria and archaea with immunity against nucleic acids of foreign origin. CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) are the key element of this system, since they are responsible for its selectivity and effectiveness. Typical crRNAs consist of a spacer sequence flanked with 5' and 3' handles originating from repeat sequences that are important for recognition of these small RNAs by the Cas machinery. In this investigation, we studied the type I-C CRISPR-Cas system in Porphyromonas gingivalis, a human pathogen associated with periodontitis, rheumatoid arthritis, cardiovascular disease, and aspiration pneumonia. We demonstrated the importance of the 5' handle for crRNA recognition by the effector complex and consequently activity, as well as secondary trimming of the 3' handle, which was not affected by modifications of the repeat sequence.IMPORTANCEPorphyromonas gingivalis, a clinically relevant Gram-negative, anaerobic bacterium, is one of the major etiologic agents of periodontitis and has been linked with the development of other clinical conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, cardiovascular disease, and aspiration pneumonia. The presented results on the biogenesis and functions of crRNAs expand our understanding of CRISPR-Cas cellular defenses in P. gingivalis and of horizontal gene transfer in bacteria.

28891793	In prostate cancer, resistance to the antiandrogen enzalutamide (Enz) can occur through bypass of androgen receptor (AR) blockade by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). In contrast to fixed genomic alterations, here we show that GR-mediated antiandrogen resistance is adaptive and reversible due to regulation of GR expression by a tissue-specific enhancer. GR expression is silenced in prostate cancer by a combination of AR binding and EZH2-mediated repression at the GR locus, but is restored in advanced prostate cancers upon reversion of both repressive signals. Remarkably, BET bromodomain inhibition resensitizes drug-resistant tumors to Enz by selectively impairing the GR signaling axis via this enhancer. In addition to revealing an underlying molecular mechanism of GR-driven drug resistance, these data suggest that inhibitors of broadly active chromatin-readers could have utility in nuanced clinical contexts of acquired drug resistance with a more favorable therapeutic index.

28890334	Standard CRISPR-mediated gene disruption strategies rely on Cas9-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Here, we show that CRISPR-dependent base editing efficiently inactivates genes by precisely converting four codons (CAA, CAG, CGA, and TGG) into STOP codons without DSB formation. To facilitate gene inactivation by induction of STOP codons (iSTOP), we provide access to a database of over 3.4 million single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) for iSTOP (sgSTOPs) targeting 97%-99% of genes in eight eukaryotic species, and we describe a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assay that allows the rapid detection of iSTOP-mediated editing in cell populations and clones. To simplify the selection of sgSTOPs, our resource includes annotations for off-target propensity, percentage of isoforms targeted, prediction of nonsense-mediated decay, and restriction enzymes for RFLP analysis. Additionally, our database includes sgSTOPs that could be employed to precisely model over 32,000 cancer-associated nonsense mutations. Altogether, this work provides a comprehensive resource for DSB-free gene disruption by iSTOP.	P Billon|EE Bryant|SA Joseph|TS Nambiar|SB Hayward|R Rothstein|A Ciccia
28887462	A gene drive biases inheritance of a gene so that it increases in frequency within a population even when the gene confers no fitness benefit. There has been renewed interest in environmental releases of engineered gene drives due to recent proof of principle experiments with the CRISPR-Cas9 system as a drive mechanism. Release of modified organisms, however, is controversial, especially when the drive mechanism could theoretically alter all individuals of a species. Thus, it is desirable to have countermeasures to reverse a drive if a problem arises. Several genetic mechanisms for limiting or eliminating gene drives have been proposed and/or developed, including synthetic resistance, reversal drives, and immunizing reversal drives. While predictions about efficacy of these mechanisms have been optimistic, we lack detailed analyses of their expected dynamics. We develop a discrete time model for population genetics of a drive and proposed genetic countermeasures. Efficacy of drive reversal varies between countermeasures. For some parameter values, the model predicts unexpected behavior including polymorphic equilibria and oscillatory dynamics. The timing and number of released individuals containing a genetic countermeasure can substantially impact outcomes. The choice among countermeasures by researchers and regulators will depend on specific goals and population parameters of target populations.	MR Vella|CE Gunning|AL Lloyd|F Gould
28886363	Off-target effects and mosaicism are major concerns for applying CRISPR-Cas9 to correct genetic mutations. A recent article in Nature by Ma et al. (2017) uses an elegant CRISPR-Cas9 approach that repairs a genetic mutation in human embryos with negligible mosaicism and no off-target effects, bringing this editing tool closer to clinical application.

28884816	Bioinformatics tools to design guide-RNAs (gRNAs) in Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats systems mostly focused on minimizing off-targeting to enhance efficacy of genome editing. However, there are circumstances in which off-targeting might be desirable to target multiple genes simultaneously with a single gRNA. We termed these gRNAs as promiscuous gRNAs. Here, we present a computational workflow to identify promiscuous gRNAs that putatively bind to the region of interest for a defined list of genes in a genome. We experimentally validated two promiscuous gRNA for gene deletion, one targeting FAA1 and FAA4 and one targeting PLB1 and PLB2, thus demonstrating that multiplexed genome editing through design of promiscuous gRNA can be performed in a time and cost-effective manner.

28882611	Antigen receptor gene assembly is accomplished in developing lymphocytes by the V(D)J recombination reaction, which can be separated into two steps: DNA cleavage by the recombination-activating gene (RAG) nuclease and joining of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) by components of the nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway. Deficiencies for NHEJ factors can result in immunodeficiency and a propensity to accumulate genomic instability, thus highlighting the importance of identifying all players in this process and deciphering their functions. Bcl2 transgenic v-Abl kinase-transformed pro-B cells provide a pseudo-physiological cellular system to study V(D)J recombination. Treatment of v-Abl/Bcl2 pro-B cells with the Abl kinase inhibitor Imatinib leads to G1 cell cycle arrest, the rapid induction of Rag1/2 gene expression and V(D)J recombination. In this system, the Bcl2 transgene alleviates Imatinib-induced apoptosis enabling the analysis of induced V(D)J recombination. Although powerful, the use of mouse models carrying the Bcl2 transgene for the generation of v-Abl pro-B cell lines is time and money consuming. Here, we describe a method for generating v-Abl/Bcl2 pro-B cell lines from wild type mice and for performing gene knock-out using episomal CRISPR/Cas9 targeting vectors. Using this approach, we generated distinct NHEJ-deficient pro-B cell lines and quantified V(D)J recombination levels in these cells. Furthermore, this methodology can be adapted to generate pro-B cell lines deficient for any gene suspected to play a role in V(D)J recombination, and more generally DSB repair.

28879860	CRISPR-Cas9 has emerged as a simple, precise and most rapid genome editing technology. With a number of promising applications ranging from agriculture and environment to clinical therapeutics, it is greatly transforming the field of molecular biology. However, there are certain ethical, moral and safety concerns related to the attractive applications of this technique. The most contentious issues concerning human germline modifications are the challenges to human safety and morality such as risk of unforeseen, undesirable effects in clinical applications particularly to correct or prevent genetic diseases, matter of informed consent and the risk of exploitation for eugenics. Stringent regulations and guidelines as well as worldwide debate and awareness are required to ensure responsible and wise use of CRISPR mediated genome editing technology. There is a need for an extensive dialogue among scientists, ethicists, industrialists and policy makers on its societal implications. The opinion of different elements of the society including the general public as well as religious scholars is also critical. In countries with existing legislative framework, it might be appropriate to allow CRISPR based research to proceed with proper justification. However, much anticipated future clinical applications must be strictly regulated with newly established regulations.	ZK Shinwari|F Tanveer|AT Khalil

The advances of genome editing from ZFNs and TALLENs to CRISPRs defines it wide applicability. Reproduction is the fundamental process by which all organisms maintain their generations. CRISPR/Cas9, a new versatile genome editing tool is recently tamed to correct several disease causing genetic mutations spreading its arms to improve reproductive health. It not only edit harmful genetic mutations but is also applied to control the spread of parasitic diseases like malaria by introducing selfish genetic elements, propagated through generations and population via reproduction. These applications made us to review the recent developments of CRISPRs use in reproductive biology.	FA Khan|NS Pandupuspitasari|H ChunJie|HI Ahmad|K Wang|MJ Ahmad|S Zhang
28879858	The CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat)-Cas9 (CRISPR-associated nuclease 9) method has been dramatically changing the field of genome engineering. It is a rapid, highly efficient and versatile tool for precise modification of genome that uses a guide RNA (gRNA) to target Cas9 to a specific sequence. This novel RNA-guided genome-editing technique has become a revolutionary tool in biomedical science and has many innovative applications in different fields. In this review, we briefly introduce the Cas9-mediated genome-editing tool, summarize the recent advances in CRISPR/Cas9 technology to engineer the genomes of a wide variety of organisms, and discuss their applications to treatment of fungal and viral disease. We also discuss advantageous of CRISPR/Cas9 technology to drug design, creation of animal model, and to food, agricultural and energy sciences. Adoption of the CRISPR/Cas9 technology in biomedical and biotechnological researches would create innovative applications of it not only for breeding of strains exhibiting desired traits for specific industrial and medical applications, but also for investigation of genome function.

28879857	The CRISPR-Cas9 has revolutionized the field of molecular biology, medical genetics and medicine. The technology is robust, facile and simple to achieve genome targeting in cells and organisms. However, to propagate these nucleases for therapeutic application, the on-target specificity is of paramount importance. Although the binding and cleavage of off-target sites by Cas9 is issue of concern, however the specificity of CRISPR technology is greatly improved in current research employing the use of engineer nucleases, improved gRNA selection, novel Cas9 orhtologs and the advancement in methods to detect and screen off-target sites and its effects. Here we summarize the advances in this state-of-the-art technology that will equip the genome editing tools to be applied in clinical research. The researcher should optimize these methods with emphasize to achieve perfection in the specificity.	M Jamal|A Ullah|M Ahsan|R Tyagi|Z Habib|K Rehman
28879855	Recently the engineered nucleases have revolutionized genome editing to perturb gene expression at specific sites in complex eukaryotic genomes. Three important classes of these genome editing tools are Moreover, the more recent type II Clustered Regularly Inter-spaced Short Palindromic Repeats/Crispr associated protein (CRISPR/Cas9) system has become the most favorite plant genome editing tool for its precision and RNA based specificity unlike its counterparts which rely on protein based specificity. Plasmid-mediated co-delivery of multiple sgRNAs and Cas9 to the Plant cell can simultaneously alter more than one target loci which enable multiplex genome editing. In this review, we discuss recent advancements in the CRISPR/ Cas9 technology mechanism, theory and its applications in plants and agriculture. We also suggest that the CRISPR/ Cas9 as an effective genome editing tool, has vast potential for crop improvement and studying gene regulation mechanism and chromatin remodeling.

28879854	CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-CRISPR associated Protein 9), basically a bacterial immune system is now widely applicable to engineer genomes of a number of cells and organisms because of its simplicity and robustness. In research avenue the system has been optimized to regulate gene expression, modify epigenome and edit target locus. These applications make CRISPR/Cas9, a technology of choice to edit disease causing mutations as well as the epigenome more efficiently than ever before. Meanwhile its application in in vivo and ex vivo cells is encouraging the scientific community for more vigorous gene therapy and in clinical setups for therapeutic genome editing. Here we review the recent advances that CRISPR-Cas9 mediated genome editing has achieved and is reported in previous studies and address the challenges associated with it.

28879853	The epigenome is a heritable layer of information not encoded in the DNA sequence of the genome, but in chemical modifications of DNA or histones. These chemical modifications, together with transcription factors, operate as spatiotemporal regulators of genome activity. Dissecting epigenome function requires controlled site-specific alteration of epigenetic information. Such control can be obtained using designed DNA-binding platforms associated with effector domains to function as targeted transcription factors or epigenetic modifiers. Here, we review the use of dCas9 as a novel and versatile tool for fundamental studies on epigenetic landscapes, chromatin structure and transcription regulation, and the potential of this approach in basic research in these fields.

28879852	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) genes provide adaptive immunity against invasion of foreign nucleic acids in archaea and bacteria. The system functions in three distinct stages: adaptation, biogenesis, and interference. CRISPR-Cas systems are currently classified into at least five different types, each with a signature protein among which Type III systems exhibit a dual DNA/RNA interference activity. Structures of a few Type III surveillance complexes have been determined: they are composed of several different subunits and exhibit striking architectural similarities to Type I surveillance complexes. Here, we review the genetic, biochemical, and structural studies concerning CRISPR-Cas Type III systems and discuss their application for genetic manipulations, including genome engineering and gene silencing.

28873399	Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE) in combination with single-molecule sequencing technology allows precision mapping of transcription start sites (TSSs) and genome-wide capture of promoter activities in differentiated and steady state cell populations. Much less is known about whether TSS profiling can characterize diverse and non-steady state cell populations, such as the approximately 400 transitory and heterogeneous cell types that arise during ontogeny of vertebrate animals. To gain such insight, we used the chick model and performed CAGE-based TSS analysis on embryonic samples covering the full 3-week developmental period. In total, 31,863 robust TSS peaks (>1 tag per million [TPM]) were mapped to the latest chicken genome assembly, of which 34% to 46% were active in any given developmental stage. ZENBU, a web-based, open-source platform, was used for interactive data exploration. TSSs of genes critical for lineage differentiation could be precisely mapped and their activities tracked throughout development, suggesting that non-steady state and heterogeneous cell populations are amenable to CAGE-based transcriptional analysis. Our study also uncovered a large set of extremely stable housekeeping TSSs and many novel stage-specific ones. We furthermore demonstrated that TSS mapping could expedite motif-based promoter analysis for regulatory modules associated with stage-specific and housekeeping genes. Finally, using Brachyury as an example, we provide evidence that precise TSS mapping in combination with Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeat (CRISPR)-on technology enables us, for the first time, to efficiently target endogenous avian genes for transcriptional activation. Taken together, our results represent the first report of genome-wide TSS mapping in birds and the first systematic developmental TSS analysis in any amniote species (birds and mammals). By facilitating promoter-based molecular analysis and genetic manipulation, our work also underscores the value of avian models in unravelling the complex regulatory mechanism of cell lineage specification during amniote development.

28871175	CRISPR-Cas systems are adaptive prokaryotic immune systems protecting against horizontally transferred DNA or RNA such as viruses and other mobile genetic elements. Memory of past invaders is stored as spacers in CRISPR loci in a process called adaptation. Here we developed a novel assay where spacer integration results in fluorescence, enabling detection of memory formation in single cells and quantification of as few as 0.05% cells with expanded CRISPR arrays in a bacterial population. Using this fluorescent CRISPR Adaptation Reporter (f-CAR), we quantified adaptation of the two CRISPR arrays of the type I-E CRISPR-Cas system in Escherichia coli, and confirmed that more integration events are targeted to CRISPR-II than to CRISPR-I. The f-CAR conveniently analyzes and compares many samples, allowing new insights into adaptation. For instance, we show that in an E. coli culture the majority of acquisition events occur in late exponential phase.	L Amlinger|M Hoekzema|EGH Wagner|S Koskiniemi|M Lundgren
28869593	CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) and the nearby Cas (CRISPR-associated) operon establish an RNA-based adaptive immunity system in prokaryotes. Molecular memory is created when a short foreign DNA-derived prespacer is integrated into the CRISPR array as a new spacer. Whereas the RNA-guided CRISPR interference mechanism varies widely among CRISPR-Cas systems, the spacer integration mechanism is essentially identical. The conserved Cas1 and Cas2 proteins form an integrase complex consisting of two distal Cas1 dimers bridged by a Cas2 dimer. The prespacer is bound by Cas1-Cas2 as a dual-forked DNA, and the terminal 3'-OH of each 3' overhang serves as an attacking nucleophile during integration. The prespacer is preferentially integrated into the leader-proximal region of the CRISPR array, guided by the leader sequence and a pair of inverted repeats inside the CRISPR repeat. Spacer integration in the well-studied Escherichia coli type I-E CRISPR system also relies on the bacterial integration host factor. In type II-A CRISPR, however, Cas1-Cas2 alone integrates spacers efficiently in vitro; other Cas proteins (such as Cas9 and Csn2) have accessory roles in the biogenesis phase of prespacers. Here we present four structural snapshots from the type II-A system of Enterococcus faecalis Cas1 and Cas2 during spacer integration. Enterococcus faecalis Cas1-Cas2 selectively binds to a splayed 30-base-pair prespacer bearing 4-nucleotide 3' overhangs. Three molecular events take place upon encountering a target: first, the Cas1-Cas2-prespacer complex searches for half-sites stochastically, then it preferentially interacts with the leader-side CRISPR repeat, and finally, it catalyses a nucleophilic attack that connects one strand of the leader-proximal repeat to the prespacer 3' overhang. Recognition of the spacer half-site requires DNA bending and leads to full integration. We derive a mechanistic framework to explain the stepwise spacer integration process and the leader-proximal preference.	Y Xiao|S Ng|KH Nam|A Ke
28863233	Gene drives are selfish genetic elements that use a variety of mechanisms to ensure they are transmitted to subsequent generations at greater than expected frequencies. Synthetic gene drives based on the clustered regularly interspersed palindromic repeats (CRISPR) genome editing system have been proposed as a way to alter the genetic characteristics of natural populations of organisms relevant to the goals of public health, conservation, and agriculture. Here, we review the principles and potential applications of CRISPR drives, as well as means proposed to prevent their uncontrolled spread. We also focus on recent work suggesting that factors such as natural genetic variation and inbreeding may represent substantial impediments to the propagation of CRISPR drives.	GE Zentner|MJ Wade

28859475	The guanine quadruplex (G4) structure in DNA is a secondary structure motif that plays important roles in DNA replication, transcriptional regulation, and maintenance of genomic stability. Here, we employed a quantitative mass spectrometry-based approach to profile the interaction proteomes of three well-defined G4 structures derived from the human telomere and the promoters of cMYC and cKIT genes. We identified SLIRP as a novel G4-interacting protein. We also demonstrated that the protein could bind directly with G4 DNA with Kd values in the low nanomolar range and revealed that the robust binding of the protein toward G4 DNA requires its RRM domain. We further assessed, by using CRISPR-Cas9-introduced affinity tag and ChIP-Seq analysis, the genome-wide occupancy of SLIRP, and showed that the protein binds preferentially to G-rich DNA sequences that can fold into G4 structures. Together, our results uncovered a novel cellular protein that can interact directly with G4 DNA, which underscored the complex regulatory networks involved in G4 biology.

28859335	Mutations in FIG4, coding for a phosphoinositol(3,5) bisphosphate 5' phosphatase and involved in vesicular trafficking and fusion, have been shown causing a recessive form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT). We have identified a novel intronic mutation in the FIG4 in a wheel-chair bound patient presenting with a severe form of CMT4J and provide a longitudinal study. Investigations indicated a demyelinating sensorimotor polyneuropathy with diffuse active denervation and severe axonal loss. Genetic testing revealed that the patient is heterozygous for 2 FIG4 mutations, p.I41T and a T > G transversion at IVS17-10, the latter predicted to cause a splicing defect. FIG4 was severely diminished in patient's fibroblasts indicating loss-of-function. Consistent with FIG4's function in phosphoinositol homeostasis and vesicular trafficking, fibroblasts contained multiple large vacuoles and vesicular organelles were abnormally dispersed. FIG4 deficiency has implications for turnover of membrane proteins. The transient receptor cation channel, TRPV4, accumulated at the plasma membrane of patient's fibroblasts due to slow turnover. Knocking down Fig4 in murine cultured motor neurons resulted in vacuolation and cell death. Inhibiting TRPV4 activity significantly preserved viability, although not correcting vesicular trafficking. In conclusion, we demonstrate a new FIG4 intronic mutation and, importantly, a functional interaction between FIG4 and TRPV4.	BJ Gentil|E O'Ferrall|C Chalk|LF Santana|HD Durham|R Massie

28855635	The Mediterranean fruitfly Ceratitis capitata (medfly) is an invasive agricultural pest of high economic impact and has become an emerging model for developing new genetic control strategies as an alternative to insecticides. Here, we report the successful adaptation of CRISPR-Cas9-based gene disruption in the medfly by injecting in vitro pre-assembled, solubilized Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) loaded with gene-specific single guide RNAs (sgRNA) into early embryos. When targeting the eye pigmentation gene white eye (we), a high rate of somatic mosaicism in surviving G0 adults was observed. Germline transmission rate of mutated we alleles by G0 animals was on average above 52%, with individual cases achieving nearly 100%. We further recovered large deletions in the we gene when two sites were simultaneously targeted by two sgRNAs. CRISPR-Cas9 targeting of the Ceratitis ortholog of the Drosophila segmentation paired gene (Ccprd) caused segmental malformations in late embryos and in hatched larvae. Mutant phenotypes correlate with repair by non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) lesions in the two targeted genes. This simple and highly effective Cas9 RNP-based gene editing to introduce mutations in C. capitata will significantly advance the design and development of new effective strategies for pest control management.

28854172	The majority of genetic variants associated with common human diseases map to enhancers, non-coding elements that shape cell-type-specific transcriptional programs and responses to extracellular cues. Systematic mapping of functional enhancers and their biological contexts is required to understand the mechanisms by which variation in non-coding genetic sequences contributes to disease. Functional enhancers can be mapped by genomic sequence disruption, but this approach is limited to the subset of enhancers that are necessary in the particular cellular context being studied. We hypothesized that recruitment of a strong transcriptional activator to an enhancer would be sufficient to drive target gene expression, even if that enhancer was not currently active in the assayed cells. Here we describe a discovery platform that can identify stimulus-responsive enhancers for a target gene independent of stimulus exposure. We used tiled CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) to synthetically recruit a transcriptional activator to sites across large genomic regions (more than 100 kilobases) surrounding two key autoimmunity risk loci, CD69 and IL2RA. We identified several CRISPRa-responsive elements with chromatin features of stimulus-responsive enhancers, including an IL2RA enhancer that harbours an autoimmunity risk variant. Using engineered mouse models, we found that sequence perturbation of the disease-associated Il2ra enhancer did not entirely block Il2ra expression, but rather delayed the timing of gene activation in response to specific extracellular signals. Enhancer deletion skewed polarization of naive T cells towards a pro-inflammatory T helper (TH17) cell state and away from a regulatory T cell state. This integrated approach identifies functional enhancers and reveals how non-coding variation associated with human immune dysfunction alters context-specific gene programs.

28851865	Salmonella enterica subsp enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) is a serovar with broad host range. To determine the genomic diversity of S. Typhimurium, we sequenced 39 isolates (37 Australian and 2 UK isolates) representing 14 Repeats Groups (RGs) determined primarily by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR). Analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) among the 39 isolates yielded an average of 1,232 SNPs per isolate, ranging from 128 SNPs to 11,339 SNPs relative to the reference strain LT2. Phylogenetic analysis of the 39 isolates together with 66 publicly available genomes divided the 105 isolates into five clades and 19 lineages, with the majority of the isolates belonging to clades I and II. The composition of CRISPR profiles correlated well with the lineages, showing progressive deletion and occasional duplication of spacers. Prophage genes contributed nearly a quarter of the S. Typhimurium accessory genome. Prophage profiles were found to be correlated with lineages and CRISPR profiles. Three new variants of HP2-like P2 prophage, several new variants of P22 prophage and a plasmid-like genomic island StmGI_0323 were found. This study presents evidence of horizontal transfer from other serovars or species and provides a broader understanding of the global genomic diversity of S. Typhimurium.

28849762	The urokinase receptor (uPAR) is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein that promotes tissue remodeling, tumor cell adhesion, migration and invasion. uPAR mediates degradation of the extracellular matrix through protease recruitment and enhances cell adhesion, migration and signaling through vitronectin binding and interactions with integrins. Full-length uPAR is released from the cell surface, but the mechanism and significance of uPAR shedding remain obscure. Here we identify transmembrane glycerophosphodiesterase GDE3 as a GPI-specific phospholipase C that cleaves and releases uPAR with consequent loss of function, whereas its homologue GDE2 fails to attack uPAR. GDE3 overexpression depletes uPAR from distinct basolateral membrane domains in breast cancer cells, resulting in a less transformed phenotype, it slows tumor growth in a xenograft model and correlates with prolonged survival in patients. Our results establish GDE3 as a negative regulator of the uPAR signaling network and, furthermore, highlight GPI-anchor hydrolysis as a cell-intrinsic mechanism to alter cell behavior.

28840558	The goal of personalised medicine is to develop tailor-made therapies for patients in whom currently available therapeutics fail. This approach requires correlating individual patient genotype data to specific disease phenotype data and using these stratified data sets to identify bespoke therapeutics. Applications for personalised medicine include common complex diseases which may have multiple targets, as well as rare monogenic disorders, for which the target may be unknown. In both cases, whole genome sequence analysis (WGS) is discovering large numbers of disease associated mutations in new candidate genes and potential modifier genes. Currently, the main limiting factor is the determination of which mutated genes are important for disease progression and therefore represent potential targets for drug discovery. Zebrafish have gained popularity as a model organism for understanding developmental processes, disease mechanisms and more recently for drug discovery and toxicity testing. In this chapter, we will examine the diverse roles that zebrafish can make in the expanding field of personalised medicine, from generating humanised disease models to xenograft screening of different cancer cell lines, through to finding new drugs via in vivo phenotypic screens. We will discuss the tools available for zebrafish research and recent advances in techniques, highlighting the advantages and potential of using zebrafish for high throughput disease modeling and precision drug discovery.

28838920	Although human genetics has resulted in the identification of novel lipid-related genes that can be targeted for the prevention of atherosclerotic vascular disease, medications targeting these genes or their protein products have short-term effects and require frequent administration during the course of the lifetime for maximal benefit. Genome-editing technologies, such as CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-CRISPR-associated 9) have the potential to permanently alter genes in the body and produce long-term and even lifelong protection against atherosclerosis. In this review, we discuss recent advances in genome-editing technologies and early proof-of-concept studies of somatic in vivo genome editing in mice that highlight the potential of genome editing to target disease-related genes in patients, which would establish a novel therapeutic paradigm for atherosclerosis.

28837701	Here, we established the Drosophila Giant Fiber neurons (GF) as a novel model to study axonal trafficking of L1-type Cell Adhesion Molecules (CAM) Neuroglian (Nrg) in the adult CNS using live imaging. L1-type CAMs are well known for their importance in nervous system development and we previously demonstrated a role for Nrg in GF synapse formation. However, in the adult they have also been implicated in synaptic plasticity and regeneration. In addition, to its canonical role in organizing cytoskeletal elements at the plasma membrane, vertebrate L1CAM has also been shown to regulate transcription indirectly as well as directly via its import to the nucleus. Here, we intend to determine if the sole L1CAM homolog Nrg is retrogradley transported and thus has the potential to relay signals from the synapse to the soma. Live imaging of c-terminally tagged Nrg in the GF revealed that there are at least two populations of retrograde vesicles that differ in speed, and either move with consistent or varying velocity. To determine if endogenous Nrg is retrogradely transported, we inhibited two key regulators, Lissencephaly-1 (Lis1) and Dynactin, of the retrograde motor protein Dynein. Similar to previously described phenotypes for expression of poisonous subunits of Dynactin, we found that developmental knock down of Lis1 disrupted GF synaptic terminal growth and that Nrg vesicles accumulated inside the stunted terminals in both mutant backgrounds. Moreover, post mitotic Lis1 knock down in mature GFs by either RNAi or Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) induced mutations, resulted in normal length terminals with fully functional GF synapses which also exhibited severe accumulation of endogenous Nrg vesicles. Thus, our data suggests that accumulation of Nrg vesicles is due to failure of retrograde transport rather than a failure of terminal development. Together with the finding that post mitotic knock down of Lis1 also disrupted retrograde transport of tagged Nrg vesicles in GF axons, it demonstrates that endogenous Nrg protein is transported from the synapse to the soma in the adult central nervous system in a Lis1-dependent manner.

28837670	The oral bacterial species Porphyromonas gingivalis, a periodontal pathogen, has plastic genomes that may be driven by homologous recombination with exogenous deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) that is incorporated by natural transformation and conjugation. However, bacteriophages and plasmids, both of which are main resources of exogenous DNA, do not exist in the known P. gingivalis genomes. This could be associated with an adaptive immunity system conferred by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated (cas) genes in P. gingivalis as well as innate immune systems such as a restriction-modification system. In a previous study, few immune targets were predicted for P. gingivalis CRISPR/Cas. In this paper, we analyzed 51 P. gingivalis genomes, which were newly sequenced, and publicly available genomes of 13 P. gingivalis and 46 other Porphyromonas species. We detected 6 CRISPR/Cas types (classified by sequence similarity of repeat) in P. gingivalis and 12 other types in the remaining species. The Porphyromonas CRISPR spacers with potential targets in the genus Porphyromonas were approximately 23 times more abundant than those with potential targets in other genus taxa (1,720/6,896 spacers vs. 74/6,896 spacers). Porphyromonas CRISPR/Cas may be involved in genome plasticity by exhibiting selective interference against intra- and interspecies nucleic acids.

28832943	In many organisms of biotechnological importance precise genome editing is limited by inherently low homologous recombination (HR) efficiencies. A number of strategies exist to increase the effectiveness of this native DNA repair pathway; however, most strategies rely on permanently disabling competing repair pathways, thus reducing an organism's capacity to repair naturally occurring double strand breaks. Here, we describe a CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) system for gene repression in the oleochemical-producing yeast Yarrowia lipolytica. By using a multiplexed sgRNA targeting strategy, we demonstrate efficient repression of eight out of nine targeted genes to enhance HR. Strains with nonhomologous end-joining repressed were shown to have increased rates of HR when transformed with a linear DNA fragment with homology to a genomic locus. With multiplexed targeting of KU70 and KU80, and enhanced repression with Mxi1 fused to deactivated Cas9 (dCas9), rates of HR as high as 90% were achieved. The developed CRISPRi system enables enhanced HR in Y. lipolytica without permanent genetic knockouts and promises to be a potent tool for other metabolic engineering, synthetic biology, and functional genomics studies.

28829759	Inherited retinal degenerations are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of conditions that have historically shared an untreatable course. In recent years, however, a wide range of therapeutic strategies have demonstrated efficacy in preclinical studies and entered clinical trials with a common goal of improving visual function for patients affected with these conditions. Gene therapy offers a particularly elegant and precise opportunity to target the causative genetic mutations underlying these monogenic diseases. The present review will provide an overview of gene therapy with particular emphasis on key clinical results to date and challenges for the future.	PR Gupta|RM Huckfeldt

28826484	CRISPR-Cas-mediated defense utilizes information stored as spacers in CRISPR arrays to defend against genetic invaders. We define the mode of target interference and role in antiviral defense for two CRISPR-Cas systems in Marinomonas mediterranea. One system (type I-F) targets DNA. A second system (type III-B) is broadly capable of acquiring spacers in either orientation from RNA and DNA, and exhibits transcription-dependent DNA interference. Examining resistance to phages isolated from Mediterranean seagrass meadows, we found that the type III-B machinery co-opts type I-F CRISPR-RNAs. Sequencing and infectivity assessments of related bacterial and phage strains suggests an 'arms race' in which phage escape from the type I-F system can be overcome through use of type I-F spacers by a horizontally-acquired type III-B system. We propose that the phage-host arms race can drive selection for horizontal uptake and maintenance of promiscuous type III interference modules that supplement existing host type I CRISPR-Cas systems.

28815492	Conditional gene inactivation strategy helps researchers to study the gene functions that are critical in embryogenesis or in defined tissues of adulthood. The Cre/loxP system is widely used for conditional gene inactivation/activation in cells or organisms. Cre knockin animal lines are essential for gene expression or inactivation in a spatially and temporally restricted manner. However, to generate a Cre knockin line by traditional approach is laborious. Recently, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) has been proven as a simple and efficient genome-editing tool. We have used CRISPR/Cas9 system to generate rat strains that carry Cre genes in different targeted gene loci by direct delivery of gRNAs/Cas9/donors into fertilized eggs. Here, we described a stepwise procedure for the generation of Cre knockin rat, including target site selection, RNA preparation, the construction of the template donor, pronuclear injection, and the genotyping of precise Cre insertion in F0 rats. Taken together, the establishment of Cre knockin line can be achieved within 6 weeks.	Y Ma|L Zhang|X Huang
28815491	Conditional alleles in genetically modified mice allow for the deletion of a gene of interest in a target tissue when combined with a tissue-specific Cre recombinase. A conditional allele is achieved by introducing LoxP sites around a critical exon, a gene, or a cluster of genes. Previously, conditional alleles were introduced in the mouse germline by classic gene targeting in embryonic stem cells, a challenging and time-consuming procedure. Now, conditional alleles can be generated directly in fertilized mouse eggs (zygotes) using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology. This one-step generation of mice is easier in design and faster. Here, we describe our achieved success rate, the considerations in design of a conditional allele, a detailed protocol to prepare the zygote injection mix, and the screening procedure to identify the new conditional knockout mouse strain.

28815490	The generation of a new genetically modified mouse strain is a big hurdle to take for many researchers. It is often unclear which steps and decisions have to be made prior to obtaining the desired mouse model. This review aims to help researchers by providing a decision guide that answers the essential questions that need to be asked before generating the most suitable genetically modified mouse line in the most optimal timeframe. The review includes the latest technologies in both the stem cell culture and gene editing tools, particularly CRISPR/Cas9, and provides compatibility guidelines for selecting among the different types of genetic modifications that can be introduced in the mouse genome and the various routes for introducing these modifications into the mouse germline.

28811374	A survey of bacterial and archaeal genomes shows that many Tn7-like transposons contain minimal type I-F CRISPR-Cas systems that consist of fused cas8f and cas5f, cas7f, and cas6f genes and a short CRISPR array. Several small groups of Tn7-like transposons encompass similarly truncated type I-B CRISPR-Cas. This minimal gene complement of the transposon-associated CRISPR-Cas systems implies that they are competent for pre-CRISPR RNA (precrRNA) processing yielding mature crRNAs and target binding but not target cleavage that is required for interference. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that evolution of the CRISPR-Cas-containing transposons included a single, ancestral capture of a type I-F locus and two independent instances of type I-B loci capture. We show that the transposon-associated CRISPR arrays contain spacers homologous to plasmid and temperate phage sequences and, in some cases, chromosomal sequences adjacent to the transposon. We hypothesize that the transposon-encoded CRISPR-Cas systems generate displacement (R-loops) in the cognate DNA sites, targeting the transposon to these sites and thus facilitating their spread via plasmids and phages. These findings suggest the existence of RNA-guided transposition and fit the guns-for-hire concept whereby mobile genetic elements capture host defense systems and repurpose them for different stages in the life cycle of the element.

28808289	Candida parapsilosis is one of the most common causes of candidiasis, particularly in the very young and the very old. Studies of gene function are limited by the lack of a sexual cycle, the diploid genome, and a paucity of molecular tools. We describe here the development of a plasmid-based CRISPR-Cas9 system for gene editing in C. parapsilosis. A major advantage of the system is that it can be used in any genetic background, which we showed by editing genes in 20 different isolates. Gene editing is carried out in a single transformation step. The CAS9 gene is expressed only when the plasmid is present, and it can be removed easily from transformed strains. There is theoretically no limit to the number of genes that can be edited in any strain. Gene editing is increased by homology-directed repair in the presence of a repair template. Editing by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) also occurs in some genetic backgrounds. Finally, we used the system to introduce unique tags at edited sites.	L Lombardi|SA Turner|F Zhao|G Butler
28806084	Representative tertiary amines were linked to the 8-cyano-7-hydroxyquinolinyl (CyHQ) photoremovable protecting group (PPG) to create photoactivatable forms suitable for use in studying cell physiology. The photoactivation of tamoxifen and 4-hydroxytamoxifen, which can be used to activate Cre recombinase and CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, demonstrated that highly efficient release of bioactive molecules could be achieved through one- and two-photon excitation (1PE and 2PE). CyHQ-protected anilines underwent a photoaza-Claisen rearrangement instead of releasing amines. Time-resolved spectroscopic studies revealed that photorelease of the tertiary amines was extremely fast, occurring from a singlet excited state of CyHQ on the 70 ps time scale.

28805349	While the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an established regulator of skin development and homeostasis, the functions of the related tyrosine kinase receptors ERBB2 and ERBB3 in this tissue have only recently been examined. Previously reported, skin-specific deletion of each of these receptors in mice resulted in similar defects in keratinocyte proliferation and migration, resulting in impaired wound healing and tumorigenesis. Because both ERBB2 and ERBB3 are targets for treating an array of cancer types, it is important to examine the consequences of receptor inhibition in human keratinocytes. Here, we employed the CRISPR/Cas9 technology to generate HaCaT cells (an established human keratinocyte cell line) lacking ERBB2 or ERBB3. HaCaT clones lacking ERBB2 or ERBB3 showed comparable reductions in cell proliferation as assessed by BrdU staining. Apoptosis, in contrast, was reduced in ERBB3-deficient HaCaT cells only. Assessment of cell migration using a wound healing (scratch) assay showed that the closure of the wound gaps was completed by 48 h in mock and in ERBB3 knockout clones. In contrast, this process was considerably delayed in ERBB2 knockout clones, and a complete closure of the gap in the latter cells did not occur before 72 h. In conclusion, both ERBB2 and ERBB3 are essential for normal proliferation of skin keratinocytes, but in contrast to ERBB3, ERBB2 is essential for migration of human keratinocytes. These observations might bear significance to patient adverse effects of therapeutic agents targeting ERBB2 and ERBB3.	M Dahlhoff|N Gaborit|S Bultmann|H Leonhardt|Y Yarden|MR Schneider
28803727	Microsatellite repeat expansions in DNA produce pathogenic RNA species that cause dominantly inherited diseases such as myotonic dystrophy type 1 and 2 (DM1/2), Huntington's disease, and C9orf72-linked amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (C9-ALS). Means to target these repetitive RNAs are required for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Here, we describe the development of a programmable CRISPR system capable of specifically visualizing and eliminating these toxic RNAs. We observe specific targeting and efficient elimination of microsatellite repeat expansion RNAs both when exogenously expressed and in patient cells. Importantly, RNA-targeting Cas9 (RCas9) reverses hallmark features of disease including elimination of RNA foci among all conditions studied (DM1, DM2, C9-ALS, polyglutamine diseases), reduction of polyglutamine protein products, relocalization of repeat-bound proteins to resemble healthy controls, and efficient reversal of DM1-associated splicing abnormalities in patient myotubes. Finally, we report a truncated RCas9 system compatible with adeno-associated viral packaging. This effort highlights the potential of RCas9 for human therapeutics.

28802076	Acid mine drainage (AMD) is characterized by an acid and metal-rich run-off that originates from mining systems. Despite having been studied for many decades, much remains unknown about the microbial community dynamics in AMD sites, especially during their early development, when the acidity is moderate. Here, we describe draft genome assemblies from single cells retrieved from an early-stage AMD sample. These cells belong to the genus Hydrotalea and are closely related to Hydrotalea flava. The phylogeny and average nucleotide identity analysis suggest that all single amplified genomes (SAGs) form two clades that may represent different strains. These cells have the genomic potential for denitrification, copper and other metal resistance. Two coexisting CRISPR-Cas loci were recovered across SAGs, and we observed heterogeneity in the population with regard to the spacer sequences, together with the loss of trailer-end spacers. Our results suggest that the genomes of Hydrotalea sp. strains studied here are adjusting to a quickly changing selective pressure at the microhabitat scale, and an important form of this selective pressure is infection by foreign DNA.

28802043	Ants exhibit cooperative behaviors and advanced forms of sociality that depend on pheromone-mediated communication. Odorant receptor neurons (ORNs) express specific odorant receptors (ORs) encoded by a dramatically expanded gene family in ants. In most eusocial insects, only the queen can transmit genetic information, restricting genetic studies. In contrast, workers in Harpegnathos saltator ants can be converted into gamergates (pseudoqueens) that can found entire colonies. This feature facilitated CRISPR-Cas9 generation of germline mutations in orco, the gene that encodes the obligate co-receptor of all ORs. orco mutations should significantly impact olfaction. We demonstrate striking functions of Orco in odorant perception, reproductive physiology, and social behavior plasticity. Surprisingly, unlike in other insects, loss of OR functionality also dramatically impairs development of the antennal lobe to which ORNs project. Therefore, the development of genetics in Harpegnathos establishes this ant species as a model organism to study the complexity of eusociality.

28801311	Non-human animal models of human diseases advance our knowledge of the genetic underpinnings of disease and lead to the development of novel therapies for humans. While mice are the most common model organisms, their usefulness is limited. Larger animals may provide more accurate and valuable disease models, but it has, until recently, been challenging to create large animal disease models. Genome editors, such as Clustered Randomised Interspersed Palindromic Repeat (CRISPR), meet some of these challenges and bring routine genome engineering of larger animals and non-human primates (NHPs) well within reach. There is growing interest in creating NHP models of brain disorders such as autism, depression and Alzheimer's, which are very difficult to model or study in other organisms, including humans. New treatments are desperately needed for this set of disorders. This paper is novel in asking: Insofar as NHPs are being considered for use as model organisms for brain disorders, can this be done ethically? The paper concludes that it cannot. Notwithstanding ongoing debate about NHPs' moral status, (1) animal welfare concerns, (2) the availability of alternative methods of studying brain disorders and (3) unmet expectations of benefit justify a stop on the creation of NHP model organisms to study brain disorders. The lure of using new genetic technologies combined with the promise of novel therapeutics presents a formidable challenge to those who call for slow, careful, and only necessary research involving NHPs. But researchers should not create macaques with social deficits or capuchin monkeys with memory deficits just because they can.	CP Neuhaus
28800587	Phenotypic assays using human primary cells are highly valuable tools for target discovery and validation in drug discovery. Expression knockdown (KD) of such targets in these assays allows the investigation of their role in models of disease processes. Therefore, efficient and fast modes of protein KD in phenotypic assays are required. The CRISPR/Cas9 system has been shown to be a versatile and efficient means of gene inactivation in immortalized cell lines. Here we describe the use of adenoviral (AdV) CRISPR/Cas9 vectors for efficient gene inactivation in two human primary cell types, normal human lung fibroblasts and human bronchial epithelial cells. The effects of gene inactivation were studied in the TGF-β-induced fibroblast to myofibroblast transition assay (FMT) and the epithelial to mesenchymal transition assay (EMT), which are SMAD3 dependent and reflect pathogenic mechanisms observed in fibrosis. Co-transduction (co-TD) of AdV Cas9 with SMAD3-targeting guide RNAs (gRNAs) resulted in fast and efficient genome editing judged by insertion/deletion (indel) formation, as well as significant reduction of SMAD3 protein expression and nuclear translocation. This led to phenotypic changes downstream of SMAD3 inhibition, including substantially decreased alpha smooth muscle actin and fibronectin 1 expression, which are markers for FMT and EMT, respectively. A direct comparison between co-TD of separate Cas9 and gRNA AdV, versus TD with a single "all-in-one" Cas9/gRNA AdV, revealed that both methods achieve similar levels of indel formation. These data demonstrate that AdV CRISPR/Cas9 is a useful and efficient tool for protein KD in human primary cell phenotypic assays. The use of AdV CRISPR/Cas9 may offer significant advantages over the current existing tools and should enhance target discovery and validation opportunities.

28796837	Rathayibacter toxicus is a forage grass associated Gram-positive bacterium of major concern to food safety and agriculture. This species is listed by USDA-APHIS as a plant pathogen select agent because it produces a tunicamycin-like toxin that is lethal to livestock and may be vectored by nematode species native to the U.S. The complete genomes of two strains of R. toxicus, including the type strain FH-79, were sequenced and analyzed in comparison with all available, complete R. toxicus genomes. Genome sizes ranged from 2,343,780 to 2,394,755 nucleotides, with 2079 to 2137 predicted open reading frames; all four strains showed remarkable synteny over nearly the entire genome, with only a small transposed region. A cluster of genes with similarity to the tunicamycin biosynthetic cluster from Streptomyces chartreusis was identified. The tunicamycin gene cluster (TGC) in R. toxicus contained 14 genes in two transcriptional units, with all of the functional elements for tunicamycin biosynthesis present. The TGC had a significantly lower GC content (52%) than the rest of the genome (61.5%), suggesting that the TGC may have originated from a horizontal transfer event. Further analysis indicated numerous remnants of other potential horizontal transfer events are present in the genome. In addition to the TGC, genes potentially associated with carotenoid and exopolysaccharide production, bacteriocins and secondary metabolites were identified. A CRISPR array is evident. There were relatively few plant-associated cell-wall hydrolyzing enzymes, but there were numerous secreted serine proteases that share sequence homology to the pathogenicity-associated protein Pat-1 of Clavibacter michiganensis. Overall, the genome provides clear insight into the possible mechanisms for toxin production in R. toxicus, providing a basis for future genetic approaches.

28794219	Self-replicating gene drives that can spread deleterious alleles through animal populations have been promoted as a much needed but controversial 'silver bullet' for controlling invasive alien species. Homing-based drives comprise an endonuclease and a guide RNA (gRNA) that are replicated during meiosis via homologous recombination. However, their efficacy for controlling wild populations is threatened by inherent polymorphic resistance and the creation of resistance alleles via non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ)-mediated DNA repair. We used stochastic individual-based models to identify realistic gene-drive strategies capable of eradicating vertebrate pest populations (mice, rats and rabbits) on islands. One popular strategy, a sex-reversing drive that converts heterozygous females into sterile males, failed to spread and required the ongoing deployment of gene-drive carriers to achieve eradication. Under alternative strategies, multiplexed gRNAs could overcome inherent polymorphic resistance and were required for eradication success even when the probability of NHEJ was low. Strategies causing homozygotic embryonic non-viability or homozygotic female sterility produced high probabilities of eradication and were robust to NHEJ-mediated deletion of the DNA sequence between multiplexed endonuclease recognition sites. The latter two strategies also purged the gene drive when eradication failed, therefore posing lower long-term risk should animals escape beyond target islands. Multiplexing gRNAs will be necessary if this technology is to be useful for insular extirpation attempts; however, precise knowledge of homing rates will be required to design low-risk gene drives with high probabilities of eradication success.

28790350	CRISPR/Cas9 is a valuable tool for both basic and applied research that has been widely applied to different plant species. Nonetheless, a systematical assessment of the efficiency of this method is not available for the allotetraploid Brassica napus-an important oilseed crop. In this study, we examined the mutation efficiency of the CRISPR/Cas9 method for 12 genes and also determined the pattern, specificity and heritability of these gene modifications in B. napus. The average mutation frequency for a single-gene targeted sgRNA in the T0 generation is 65.3%. For paralogous genes located in conserved regions that were targeted by sgRNAs, we observed mutation frequencies that ranged from 27.6% to 96.6%. Homozygotes were readily found in T0 plants. A total of 48.2% of the gene mutations, including homozygotes, bi-alleles, and heterozygotes were stably inherited as classic Mendelian alleles in the next generation (T1) without any new mutations or reversions. Moreover, no mutation was found in the putative off-target sites among the examined T0 plants. Collectively, our results demonstrate that CRISPR/Cas9 is an efficient tool for creating targeted genome modifications at multiple loci that are stable and inheritable in B. napus. These findings open many doors for biotechnological applications in oilseed crops.	H Yang|JJ Wu|T Tang|KD Liu|C Dai
28790199	Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a severe inherited form of muscular dystrophy caused by mutations in the reading frame of the dystrophin gene disrupting its protein expression. Dystrophic cardiomyopathy is a leading cause of death in Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients, and currently no effective treatment exists to halt its progression. Recent advancement in genome editing technologies offers a promising therapeutic approach in restoring dystrophin protein expression. However, the impact of this approach on Duchenne muscular dystrophy cardiac function has yet to be evaluated. Therefore, we assessed the therapeutic efficacy of CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-mediated genome editing on dystrophin expression and cardiac function in mdx/Utr+/- mice after a single systemic delivery of recombinant adeno-associated virus.	To examine the efficiency and physiological impact of CRISPR-mediated genome editing on cardiac dystrophin expression and function in dystrophic mice.	Here, we packaged SaCas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat-associated 9 from Staphylococcus aureus) and guide RNA constructs into an adeno-associated virus vector and systemically delivered them to mdx/Utr+/- neonates. We showed that CRIPSR-mediated genome editing efficiently excised the mutant exon 23 in dystrophic mice, and immunofluorescence data supported the restoration of dystrophin protein expression in dystrophic cardiac muscles to a level approaching 40%. Moreover, there was a noted restoration in the architecture of cardiac muscle fibers and a reduction in the extent of fibrosis in dystrophin-deficient hearts. The contractility of cardiac papillary muscles was also restored in CRISPR-edited cardiac muscles compared with untreated controls. Furthermore, our targeted deep sequencing results confirmed that our adeno-associated virus-CRISPR/Cas9 strategy was very efficient in deleting the ≈23 kb of intervening genomic sequences.	This study provides evidence for using CRISPR-based genome editing as a potential therapeutic approach for restoring dystrophic cardiomyopathy structurally and functionally.

28786539	Microalgae serve as a promising source for the production of biofuels and bio-based chemicals. They are superior to terrestrial plants as feedstock in many aspects and their biomass is naturally rich in lipids, carbohydrates, proteins, pigments, and other valuable compounds. Due to the relatively slow growth rate and high cultivation cost of microalgae, to screen efficient and robust microalgal strains as well as genetic modifications of the available strains for further improvement are of urgent demand in the development of microalgae-based biorefinery. In genetic engineering of microalgae, transformation and selection methods are the key steps to accomplish the target gene modification. However, determination of the preferable type and dosage of antibiotics used for transformant selection is usually time-consuming and microalgal-strain-dependent. Therefore, more powerful and efficient techniques should be developed to meet this need. In this review, the conventional and emerging genome-editing tools (e.g., CRISPR-Cas9, TALEN, and ZFN) used in editing the genomes of nuclear, mitochondria, and chloroplast of microalgae are thoroughly surveyed. Although all the techniques mentioned above demonstrate their abilities to perform gene editing and desired phenotype screening, there still need to overcome higher production cost and lower biomass productivity, to achieve efficient production of the desired products in microalgal biorefineries.

28786481	Recently, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) based genomic editing technologies have armed researchers with powerful new tools to biological and biomedical investigations. To further improve and expand its functionality, natural, and engineered CRISPR associated nine proteins (Cas9s) have been investigated, various CRISPR delivery strategies have been tested and optimized, and multiple schemes have been developed to ensure precise mammalian genome editing. Benefiting from those in-depth understanding and further development of CRISPR, versatile CRISPR-based platforms for genome editing have been rapidly developed to advance investigations in biology and biomedicine. In biological research area, CRISPR has been widely adopted in both fundamental and applied research fields, such as accurate base editing, transcriptional regulation, and genome-wide screening. In biomedical research area, CRISPR has also shown its extensive applicability in the establishment of animal models for genetic disorders especially those large animals and non-human primates models, and gene therapy to combat virus infectious diseases, to correct monogenic disorders in vivo or in pluripotent cells. In this prospect article, after highlighting recent developments of CRISPR systems, we outline different applications and current limitations of CRISPR use in biological and biomedical investigation. Finally, we provide a perspective for future development and potential risks of this multifunctional technology.	J Huang|Y Wang|J Zhao
28785032	The CRISPR-Cas system owes its utility as a genome-editing tool to its origin as a prokaryotic immune system. The first demonstration of its activity against bacterial viruses (phages) is also the first record of phages evading that immunity 1 . This evasion can be due to point mutations 1 , large-scale deletions 2 , DNA modifications 3 , or phage-encoded proteins that interfere with the CRISPR-Cas system, known as anti-CRISPRs (Acrs) 4 . The latter are of biotechnological interest, as Acrs can serve as off switches for CRISPR-based genome editing 5 . Every Acr characterized to date originated from temperate phages, genomic islands, or prophages 4-8 , and shared properties with the first Acr discovered. Here, with a phage-oriented approach, we have identified an unrelated Acr in a virulent phage of Streptococcus thermophilus. In challenging a S. thermophilus strain CRISPR-immunized against a set of virulent phages, we found one that evaded the CRISPR-encoded immunity >40,000× more often than the others. Through systematic cloning of its genes, we identified an Acr solely responsible for the abolished immunity. We extended our findings by demonstrating activity in another S. thermophilus strain, against unrelated phages, and in another bacterial genus immunized using the heterologous SpCas9 system favoured for genome editing. This Acr completely abolishes SpCas9-mediated immunity in our assays.	AP Hynes|GM Rousseau|ML Lemay|P Horvath|DA Romero|C Fremaux|S Moineau
28785021	Acid ceramidase (AC) is a lysosomal cysteine hydrolase that catalyzes the conversion of ceramide into fatty acid and sphingosine. This reaction lowers intracellular ceramide levels and concomitantly generates sphingosine used for sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) production. Since increases in ceramide and consequent decreases of S1P reduce proliferation of various cancers, AC might offer a new target for anti-tumor therapy. Here we used CrispR-Cas9-mediated gene editing to delete the gene encoding for AC, ASAH1, in human A375 melanoma cells. ASAH1-null clones show significantly greater accumulation of long-chain saturated ceramides that are substrate for AC. As seen with administration of exogenous ceramide, AC ablation blocks cell cycle progression and accelerates senescence. Importantly, ASAH1-null cells also lose the ability to form cancer-initiating cells and to undergo self-renewal, which is suggestive of a key role for AC in maintaining malignancy and self-renewal of invasive melanoma cells. The results suggest that AC inhibitors might find therapeutic use as adjuvant therapy for advanced melanoma.

28783728	Genome editing has potential for the targeted correction of germline mutations. Here we describe the correction of the heterozygous MYBPC3 mutation in human preimplantation embryos with precise CRISPR-Cas9-based targeting accuracy and high homology-directed repair efficiency by activating an endogenous, germline-specific DNA repair response. Induced double-strand breaks (DSBs) at the mutant paternal allele were predominantly repaired using the homologous wild-type maternal gene instead of a synthetic DNA template. By modulating the cell cycle stage at which the DSB was induced, we were able to avoid mosaicism in cleaving embryos and achieve a high yield of homozygous embryos carrying the wild-type MYBPC3 gene without evidence of off-target mutations. The efficiency, accuracy and safety of the approach presented suggest that it has potential to be used for the correction of heritable mutations in human embryos by complementing preimplantation genetic diagnosis. However, much remains to be considered before clinical applications, including the reproducibility of the technique with other heterozygous mutations.

28783550	The aim of this study was to analyze the characteristics of the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) sites in 45 clinical Streptococcus mutans strains and their relationship to the clinical manifestations of early childhood caries (ECC).	Forty-five S. mutans strains were isolated from the plaque samples taken from sixty-three children. CRISPR sites were sequenced and BLAST was used to compare these sites to those in the CRISPRTarget database. The association between the distribution of CRISPR sites and the manifestation of caries was analyzed by Chi-Square test. Further, biofilm formation (by crystal violet staining) and the synthesis of polysaccharide (by anthrone-sulfuric method) of all clinical isolated S. mutans strains with both CRISPR sites and no CRISPR site were comapared. Finally, acidogenicity and acidurity of two typical strains were determined using pH drop and acid tolerance assays. Biofilm formation and EPS synthesis by two typical strains were compared by 3D CLSM (Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope) assays and the expression of gtf genes were evaluated using qPCR.	We found that most of the spacers in the clinical S. mutans strains were derived from Streptococcus phages APCM01 and M102. The number of CRISPR sites in these strains was associated with the clinical manifestations of ECC. Moreover, we found that the biofilm formation and EPS synthesis ability of the S. mutans strains with both CRISPR sites was significant improved.	An association was found between the distribution of CRISPR sites and the clinical manifestations of caries. The CRISPR sites might contribute to the cariogenic potential of S. mutans.

28781236	CRISPR-Cas systems are prokaryotic immune systems against invading nucleic acids. Type I CRISPR-Cas systems employ highly diverse, multi-subunit surveillance Cascade complexes that facilitate duplex formation between crRNA and complementary target DNA for R-loop formation, retention, and DNA degradation by the subsequently recruited nuclease Cas3. Typically, the large subunit recognizes bona fide targets through the PAM (protospacer adjacent motif), and the small subunit guides the non-target DNA strand. Here, we present the Apo- and target-DNA-bound structures of the I-Fv (type I-F variant) Cascade lacking the small and large subunits. Large and small subunits are functionally replaced by the 5' terminal crRNA cap Cas5fv and the backbone protein Cas7fv, respectively. Cas5fv facilitates PAM recognition from the DNA major groove site, in contrast to all other described type I systems. Comparison of the type I-Fv Cascade with an anti-CRISPR protein-bound I-F Cascade reveals that the type I-Fv structure differs substantially at known anti-CRISPR protein target sites and might therefore be resistant to viral Cascade interception.

The two Cpf1 orthologs from Acidaminococcus sp. (AsCpf1) and Lachnospiraceae bacterium (LbCpf1) have been harnessed for eukaryotic genome editing. Cpf1 requires a specific nucleotide sequence, called a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), for target recognition. Besides the canonical TTTV PAM, Cpf1 recognizes suboptimal C-containing PAMs. Here, we report four crystal structures of LbCpf1 in complex with the crRNA and its target DNA containing either TTTA, TCTA, TCCA, or CCCA as the PAM. These structures revealed that, depending on the PAM sequences, LbCpf1 undergoes conformational changes to form altered interactions with the PAM-containing DNA duplexes, thereby achieving the relaxed PAM recognition. Collectively, the present structures advance our mechanistic understanding of the PAM-dependent, crRNA-guided DNA cleavage by the Cpf1 family nucleases.

28781125	Currently, 7 of the top 10 selling drugs are biologics, and all of them are proteins. Their large size, structural complexity, and molecular diversity often results in surfaces capable of potent and selective recognition of receptors that challenge, or evade, traditional small molecules. However, most proteins do not penetrate the lipid bilayer exterior of mammalian cells. This severe limitation dramatically limits the number of disease-relevant receptors that proteins can target and modulate. Given the major role proteins play in modern medicine, and the magnitude of this limitation, it is unsurprising that an enormous amount of effort has been dedicated to overcoming this pesky impediment. In this article, we summarize and evaluate current approaches for intracellular delivery of exogenous proteins to mammalian cells and, in doing so, aim to illuminate fertile ground for future discovery in this critical area of research.

28777929	With CRISPR/Cas9 and other genome-editing technologies, successful somatic and germline genome editing are becoming feasible. To respond, an American Society of Human Genetics (ASHG) workgroup developed this position statement, which was approved by the ASHG Board in March 2017. The workgroup included representatives from the UK Association of Genetic Nurses and Counsellors, Canadian Association of Genetic Counsellors, International Genetic Epidemiology Society, and US National Society of Genetic Counselors. These groups, as well as the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, Asia Pacific Society of Human Genetics, British Society for Genetic Medicine, Human Genetics Society of Australasia, Professional Society of Genetic Counselors in Asia, and Southern African Society for Human Genetics, endorsed the final statement. The statement includes the following positions. (1) At this time, given the nature and number of unanswered scientific, ethical, and policy questions, it is inappropriate to perform germline gene editing that culminates in human pregnancy. (2) Currently, there is no reason to prohibit in vitro germline genome editing on human embryos and gametes, with appropriate oversight and consent from donors, to facilitate research on the possible future clinical applications of gene editing. There should be no prohibition on making public funds available to support this research. (3) Future clinical application of human germline genome editing should not proceed unless, at a minimum, there is (a) a compelling medical rationale, (b) an evidence base that supports its clinical use, (c) an ethical justification, and (d) a transparent public process to solicit and incorporate stakeholder input.

28777443	Drug-induced cardiotoxicity is the one of the most common causes of drug withdrawal from market. A major barrier in managing the risk of drug-induced cardiotoxicity has been the lack of relevant models to study cardiac safety. Human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) have great potential in drug discovery and cardiotoxcity screens as they display many characteristics of the human myocardium and offer unlimited supply. This unit describes how to use pluripotent stem cells derived cardiomyocytes to study drug-induced cardiotoxicty using doxorubicin as an example. We present a workflow that explains procedure for editing hPSC using the CRISPR/Cas9 system and for differentiation of hPSC into cardiomyocytes. We also report protocols to study drug effect on ROS production, intracellular calcium concentration, formation of DNA double strand breaks, gene expression and electrophysiological properties of hPSC-CMs. © 2017 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

28767277	Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) opened an innovative and productive avenue to investigate the molecular basis of human craniofacial disease. However, GWASs identify candidate genes only; they do not prove that any particular one is the functional villain underlying disease or just an unlucky genomic bystander. Genetic manipulation of animal models is the best approach to reveal which genetic loci identified from human GWASs are functionally related to specific diseases. The purpose of this review is to discuss the potential of zebrafish to resolve which candidate genetic loci are mechanistic drivers of craniofacial diseases. Many anatomic, embryonic, and genetic features of craniofacial development are conserved among zebrafish and mammals, making zebrafish a good model of craniofacial diseases. Also, the ability to manipulate gene function in zebrafish was greatly expanded over the past 20 y, enabling systems such as Gateway Tol2 and CRISPR-Cas9 to test gain- and loss-of-function alleles identified from human GWASs in coding and noncoding regions of DNA. With the optimization of genetic editing methods, large numbers of candidate genes can be efficiently interrogated. Finding the functional villains that underlie diseases will permit new treatments and prevention strategies and will increase understanding of how gene pathways operate during normal development.

28765632	γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a non-proteinogenic amino acid that has hypotensive effects. Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) is among the most widely cultivated and consumed vegetables in the world and contains higher levels of GABA than other major crops. Increasing these levels can further enhance the blood pressure-lowering function of tomato fruit. Glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) is a key enzyme in GABA biosynthesis; it has a C-terminal autoinhibitory domain that regulates enzymatic function, and deleting this domain increases GAD activity. The tomato genome has five GAD genes (SlGAD1-5), of which two (SlGAD2 and SlGAD3) are expressed during tomato fruit development. To increase GABA content in tomato, we deleted the autoinhibitory domain of SlGAD2 and SlGAD3 using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein (Cas)9 technology. Introducing a stop codon immediately before the autoinhibitory domain increased GABA accumulation by 7 to 15 fold while having variable effects on plant and fruit size and yield. This is the first study describing the application of the CRISPR/Cas9 system to increase GABA content in tomato fruits. Our findings provide a basis for the improvement of other types of crop by CRISPR/Cas9-based genetic modification.	S Nonaka|C Arai|M Takayama|C Matsukura|H Ezura
28764328	CRISPR-Cas9 is a genome editing technology with major impact in life sciences. In this system, the endonuclease Cas9 generates double strand breaks in DNA upon RNA-guided recognition of a complementary DNA sequence, which strictly requires the presence of a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) next to the target site. Although PAM recognition is essential for cleavage, it is unknown whether and how PAM binding activates Cas9 for DNA cleavage at spatially distant sites. Here, we find evidence of a PAM-induced allosteric mechanism revealed by microsecond molecular dynamics simulations. PAM acts as an allosteric effector and triggers the interdependent conformational dynamics of the Cas9 catalytic domains (HNH and RuvC), responsible for concerted cleavage of the two DNA strands. Targeting such an allosteric mechanism should enable control of CRISPR-Cas9 functionality.	G Palermo|CG Ricci|A Fernando|R Basak|M Jinek|I Rivalta|VS Batista|JA McCammon

28760879	MDA5 is a RIG-I-like cytoplasmic sensor of dsRNA and certain RNA viruses, such as encephalomyocarditis virus, for the initiation of the IFN signaling cascade in the innate antiviral response. The affinity of MDA5 toward dsRNA is low, and its activity becomes optimal in the presence of unknown cellular coactivators. In this article, we report an essential coactivator function of dsRNA-binding protein PACT in mediating the MDA5-dependent type I IFN response. Virus-induced and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid-induced activation of MDA5 were severely impaired in PACT-knockout cells and attenuated in PACT-knockdown cells, but they were potentiated when PACT was overexpressed. PACT augmented IRF3-dependent type I IFN production subsequent to dsRNA-induced activation of MDA5. In contrast, PACT had no influence on MDA5-mediated activation of NF-κB. PACT required dsRNA interaction for its action on MDA5 and promoted dsRNA-induced oligomerization of MDA5. PACT had little stimulatory effect on MDA5 mutants deficient for oligomerization and filament assembly. PACT colocalized with MDA5 in the cytoplasm and potentiated MDA5 recruitment to the dsRNA ligand. Taken together, these findings suggest that PACT functions as an essential cellular coactivator of RIG-I, as well as MDA5, and it facilitates RNA-induced formation of MDA5 oligomers.

28760348	In bacteria and archaea, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and associated proteins (Cas) confer adaptive immunity against exogenous DNA elements. This CRISPR-Cas system has been turned into an effective tool for editing of eukaryotic DNA genomes. Pathogenic viruses that have a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) genome or that replicate through a dsDNA intermediate can also be targeted with this DNA editing tool. Here, we review how CRISPR-Cas was used in novel therapeutic approaches against the human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1), focusing on approaches that aim to permanently inactivate all virus genomes or to prevent viral persistence in latent reservoirs.

28755200	In this chapter, we intend to review gene therapy concepts applied to the potential treatment of tyrosinemia for parents and pediatricians. Therefore, our main objective is to give general informations in a comprehensible manner. Considering the nature of tyrosinemia and the current state of technology, a particular focus will be put on strategies using viral delivery of DNA to the liver. In light of the recent development of the CRISPR technology and the revival of promises for previously unavailable therapeutical tools, the present chapter aims at presenting up to date facts and potential pitfalls towards an application for metabolic diseases, in particular tyrosinemia.

28749735	Bacteria and archaea use CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune systems to defend themselves from infection by bacteriophages (phages). These RNA-guided nucleases are powerful weapons in the fight against foreign DNA, such as phages and plasmids, as well as a revolutionary gene editing tool. Phages are not passive bystanders in their interactions with CRISPR-Cas systems, however; recent discoveries have described phage genes that inhibit CRISPR-Cas function. More than 20 protein families, previously of unknown function, have been ascribed anti-CRISPR function. Here, we discuss how these CRISPR-Cas inhibitors were discovered and their modes of action were elucidated. We also consider the potential impact of anti-CRISPRs on bacterial and phage evolution. Finally, we speculate about the future of this field.	AL Borges|AR Davidson|J Bondy-Denomy
28746882	Combinatorial inhibition of effector and feedback pathways is a promising treatment strategy for KRAS mutant cancers. However, the particular pathways that should be targeted to optimize therapeutic responses are unclear. Using CRISPR/Cas9, we systematically mapped the pathways whose inhibition cooperates with drugs targeting the KRAS effectors MEK, ERK, and PI3K. By performing 70 screens in models of KRAS mutant colorectal, lung, ovarian, and pancreas cancers, we uncovered universal and tissue-specific sensitizing combinations involving inhibitors of cell cycle, metabolism, growth signaling, chromatin regulation, and transcription. Furthermore, these screens revealed secondary genetic modifiers of sensitivity, yielding a SRC inhibitor-based combination therapy for KRAS/PIK3CA double-mutant colorectal cancers (CRCs) with clinical potential. Surprisingly, acquired resistance to combinations of growth signaling pathway inhibitors develops rapidly following treatment, but by targeting signaling feedback or apoptotic priming, it is possible to construct three-drug combinations that greatly delay its emergence.

28746865	How is Polycomb (Pc), a eukaryotic negative regulator of transcription, targeted to specific mammalian genes? Our genome-wide analysis of the Pc mark H3K27me3 in murine cells revealed that Pc is preferentially associated with CpG island promoters of genes that are transcribed at a low level and less so with promoters of genes that are either silent or more highly expressed. Studies of the CpG island promoter of the Kit gene demonstrate that Pc is largely absent when the gene is silent in myeloid cells, as well as when the gene is highly expressed in mast cells. Manipulations that increase transcription in the former case, and reduce it in the latter, increase Pc occupancy. The average negative effect of Pc, we infer, is about 2-fold. We suggest possible biological roles for such negative effects and propose a mechanism by which Pc might be recruited to weakly transcribed genes.

28745625	CRISPR/Cas9 technology has greatly improved the feasibility and speed of loss-of-function studies that are essential in understanding gene function. In higher eukaryotes, paralogous genes can mask a potential phenotype by compensating the loss of a gene, thus limiting the information that can be obtained from genetic studies relying on single gene knockouts. We have developed a novel, rapid cloning method for guide RNA (gRNA) concatemers in order to create multi-gene knockouts following a single round of transfection in mouse small intestinal organoids. Our strategy allows for the concatemerization of up to four individual gRNAs into a single vector by performing a single Golden Gate shuffling reaction with annealed gRNA oligos and a pre-designed retroviral vector. This allows either the simultaneous knockout of up to four different genes, or increased knockout efficiency following the targeting of one gene by multiple gRNAs. In this protocol, we show in detail how to efficiently clone multiple gRNAs into the retroviral CRISPR-concatemer vector and how to achieve highly efficient electroporation in intestinal organoids. As an example, we show that simultaneous knockout of two pairs of genes encoding negative regulators of the Wnt signaling pathway (Axin1/2 and Rnf43/Znrf3) renders intestinal organoids resistant to the withdrawal of key growth factors.

28743818	The cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) of apicomplexan parasites is essential for secretion of micronemes and host cell invasion and egress. Both kinase specificity and localization can determine which substrates are phosphorylated. The functions of plasma membrane and cytosolic PKG isoforms of Toxoplasma gondii were unknown because of difficulties precisely manipulating expression of essential genes. Brown et al. (K. M. Brown, S. Long, and L. D. Sibley, mBio 8:e00375-17, https://doi.org/10.1128/mBio.00375-17) adapted the auxin-inducible degron (AID) system for conditional expression of T. gondii proteins. AID, in combination with clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas9 gene editing, facilitated creation of a panel of PKG mutants to demonstrate that the membrane association via acylation of PKG is critical for its essential functions in tachyzoites. The cytosolic form of PKG is not sufficient for viability and is dispensable. These studies illuminate a critical role for targeting of kinase complexes for parasite viability. The AID system enables rapid, conditional regulation of protein expression that expands the molecular toolbox of T. gondii.	K Kim
28740072	Antagonistic coevolution of parasite infectivity and host resistance may alter the biological functionality of species, yet these dynamics in nature are still poorly understood. Here we show the molecular details of a long-term phage-bacterium arms race in the environment. Bacteria (Flavobacterium columnare) are generally resistant to phages from the past and susceptible to phages isolated in years after bacterial isolation. Bacterial resistance selects for increased phage infectivity and host range, which is also associated with expansion of phage genome size. We identified two CRISPR loci in the bacterial host: a type II-C locus and a type VI-B locus. While maintaining a core set of conserved spacers, phage-matching spacers appear in the variable ends of both loci over time. The spacers mostly target the terminal end of the phage genomes, which also exhibit the most variation across time, resulting in arms-race-like changes in the protospacers of the coevolving phage population.Arms races between phage and bacteria are well known from lab experiments, but insight from field systems is limited. Here, the authors show changes in the resistance and CRISPR loci of bacteria and the infectivity, host range and genome size of phage over multiple years in an aquaculture environment.

28738471	Objective: To investigate the association between phage-mediated shiga toxin and molecular distribution of CRISPR in Escherichia (E.) coli O26∶H11 or NM. Methods: A total of 135 E. coli O26 ∶ H11 or NM strains were collected from NCBI database. Software CRT and CRISPR Finder were used to extract CRISPR and Excel was used to assign the spacer of unique number and type CRISPR. And the relationship between CRISPR and stx phage was analyzed. Results: All the 135 E. coli O26 ∶ H11 or NM strains had the CRISPR. For CRISPR1, CRISPR2.1, CRISPR2.2 and CRISPR3-4, 19, 22, 1 and 1 subtypes were found, respectively. According to the four CRISPR sites, the strains could be divided into 40 subtypes. Stx-phage was only observed in the group C of CRISPR. Compared with E. coli of stx-phage negative, E. coli with stx-phage harbored more spacers. Conclusions: CRISPR loci was extensively existed in E. coli O26∶H11 or NM, and many subtypes were found in these strains. The presence of stx-phage was related to the molecular distribution of CRISPR in E. coli O26∶H11 or NM. CRISPR might be a valuable biomarker to identify strains with high virulent potential.	目的： 探讨O26∶H11及NM血清型大肠埃希菌中成簇规律间隔短回文重复序列（CRISPR）的分子分布特征及其与stx噬菌体的关系。 方法： 135株O26∶H11及NM血清型大肠埃希菌从NCBI数据库获取，利用CRT软件及CRISPR Finder提取CRISPR信息，并用Excel软件对间隔序列进行编号及分析CRISPR亚型，并分析CRISPR与stx噬菌体之间的关系。 结果： 135株O26∶H11及NM血清型大肠埃希菌中均存在CRISPR结构，CRISPR1包括19个亚型，CRISPR 2.1包括22个亚型，CRISPR2.2包括1个亚型，CRISPR3-4包括1个亚型。stx噬菌体在CRISPR群组C中出现，stx(+)菌株比stx(-)菌株拥有更多的间隔序列。 结论： CRISPR位点在O26∶H11或NM血清型大肠埃希菌中广泛存在，且存在着不同的亚型，stx噬菌体与CRISPR的分子分布特征有关，可能作为鉴定高毒菌株的分子靶标。.

28734980	Hypoxia through transcription factor HIF1α plays a critical role in cancer development. In prostate cancer, HIF1α interplays with androgen receptor (AR) to contribute to the progression of this disease to its lethal form-castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Hypoxia upregulates several epigenetic factors including histone demethylase KDM3A which is a critical co-factor of HIF1α. However, how histone demethylases regulate hypoxia signaling is not fully understood. Here, we report that histone demethylase PHF8 plays an essential role in hypoxia signaling. Knockdown or knockout of PHF8 by RNAi or CRISPR-Cas9 system reduced the activation of HIF1α and the induction of HIF1α target genes including KDM3A. Mechanistically, PHF8 regulates hypoxia inducible genes mainly through sustaining the level of trimethylated histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3), an active mark in transcriptional regulation. The positive role of PHF8 in hypoxia signaling extended to hypoxia-induced neuroendocrine differentiation (NED), wherein PHF8 cooperates with KDM3A to regulate the expression of NED genes. Moreover, we discovered that the role of PHF8 in hypoxia signaling is associated with the presence of full-length AR in CRPC cells. Collectively, our study identified PHF8 as a novel epigenetic factor in hypoxia signaling, and the underlying regulatory mechanisms likely apply to general cancer development involving HIF1α. Therefore, targeting PHF8 can potentially be a novel therapeutic strategy in cancer therapy.	PK Maina|P Shao|X Jia|Q Liu|S Umesalma|M Marin|D Long|S Concepción-Román|HH Qi
28733458	Signaling pathway modules are often encoded by several closely related paralogous genes that can have redundant roles and are therefore difficult to analyze by loss-of-function analysis. A typical example is the Wnt signaling pathway, which in mammals is mediated by 19 Wnt ligands that can bind to 10 Frizzled (FZD) receptors. Although significant progress in understanding Wnt-FZD receptor interactions has been made in recent years, tools to generate systematic interaction maps have been largely lacking. Here we generated cell lines with multiplex mutant alleles of FZD1, FZD2, and FZD7 and demonstrate that these cells are unresponsive to canonical Wnt ligands. Subsequently, we performed genetic rescue experiments with combinations of FZDs and canonical Wnts to create a functional ligand-receptor interaction map. These experiments showed that whereas several Wnt ligands, such as Wnt3a, induce signaling through a broad spectrum of FZD receptors, others, such as Wnt8a, act through a restricted set of FZD genes. Together, our results map functional interactions of FZDs and 10 Wnt ligands and demonstrate how multiplex targeting by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9 can be used to systematically elucidate the functions of multigene families.-Voloshanenko, O., Gmach, P., Winter, J., Kranz, D., Boutros, M.

28730142	The next-generation gene editing based on CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) has been successfully implemented in a wide range of organisms including some protozoan parasites. However, application of such a versatile game-changing technology in molecular parasitology remains fairly underexplored. Here, we briefly introduce state-of-the-art in human and mouse research and usher new directions to drive the parasitology research in the years to come. In precise, we outline contemporary ways to embolden existing apicomplexan and kinetoplastid parasite models by commissioning front-line gene-tailoring methods, and illustrate how we can break the enduring gridlock of gene manipulation in non-model parasitic protists to tackle intriguing questions that remain long unresolved otherwise. We show how a judicious solicitation of the CRISPR technology can eventually balance out the two facets of pathogen-host interplay.	B Ren|N Gupta
28729350	CRISPR-Cas systems depend on the Cas1-Cas2 integrase to capture and integrate short foreign DNA fragments into the CRISPR locus, enabling adaptation to new viruses. We present crystal structures of Cas1-Cas2 bound to both donor and target DNA in intermediate and product integration complexes, as well as a cryo-electron microscopy structure of the full CRISPR locus integration complex, including the accessory protein IHF (integration host factor). The structures show unexpectedly that indirect sequence recognition dictates integration site selection by favoring deformation of the repeat and the flanking sequences. IHF binding bends the DNA sharply, bringing an upstream recognition motif into contact with Cas1 to increase both the specificity and efficiency of integration. These results explain how the Cas1-Cas2 CRISPR integrase recognizes a sequence-dependent DNA structure to ensure site-selective CRISPR array expansion during the initial step of bacterial adaptive immunity.

28724960	CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing is a next-generation strategy for genetic modifications. Typically, sgRNA is constitutively expressed relying on RNA polymerase III promoters. Polymerase II promoters initiate transcription in a flexible manner, but sgRNAs generated by RNA polymerase II promoter lost their nuclease activity. To express sgRNAs in a tissue-specific fashion and endow CRISPR with more versatile function, a novel system was established in a polycistron, where miRNAs (or shRNAs) and sgRNAs alternately emerged and co-expressed under the control of a single polymerase II promoter. Effective expression and further processing of functional miRNAs and sgRNAs were achieved. The redundant nucleotides adjacent to sgRNA were degraded, and 5'- cap structure was responsible for the compromised nuclease capacity of sgRNA: Cas9 complex. Furthermore, this strategy fulfilled conducting multiplex genome editing, as well as executing neural- specific genome editing and enhancing the proportion of homologous recombination via inhibiting NHEJ pathway by shRNA. In summary, we designed a new construction for efficient expression of sgRNAs with miRNAs (shRNAs) by virtue of RNA polymerase II promoters, which will spur the development of safer, more controllable/regulable and powerful CRISPR/Cas9 system-mediated genome editing in a wide variety of further biomedical applications.

28724352	Clustered regularly-interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) screens are usually implemented in cultured cells to identify genes with critical functions. Although several methods have been developed or adapted to analyze CRISPR screening data, no single specific algorithm has gained popularity. Thus, rigorous procedures are needed to overcome the shortcomings of existing algorithms.	We developed a Permutation-Based Non-Parametric Analysis (PBNPA) algorithm, which computes p-values at the gene level by permuting sgRNA labels, and thus it avoids restrictive distributional assumptions. Although PBNPA is designed to analyze CRISPR data, it can also be applied to analyze genetic screens implemented with siRNAs or shRNAs and drug screens.	We compared the performance of PBNPA with competing methods on simulated data as well as on real data. PBNPA outperformed recent methods designed for CRISPR screen analysis, as well as methods used for analyzing other functional genomics screens, in terms of Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curves and False Discovery Rate (FDR) control for simulated data under various settings. Remarkably, the PBNPA algorithm showed better consistency and FDR control on published real data as well.	PBNPA yields more consistent and reliable results than its competitors, especially when the data quality is low. R package of PBNPA is available at: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/PBNPA/ .

28720440	Clostridium (C.) chauvoei is a Gram-positive, spore forming, anaerobic bacterium. It causes black leg in ruminants, a typically fatal histotoxic myonecrosis. High quality circular genome sequences were generated for the C. chauvoei type strain DSM 7528T (ATCC 10092T) and a field strain 12S0467 isolated in Germany. The origin of replication (oriC) was comparable to that of Bacillus subtilis in structure with two regions containing DnaA boxes. Similar prophages were identified in the genomes of both C. chauvoei strains which also harbored hemolysin and bacterial spore formation genes. A CRISPR type I-B system with limited variations in the repeat number was identified. Sporulation and germination process related genes were homologous to that of the Clostridia cluster I group but novel variations for regulatory genes were identified indicative for strain specific control of regulatory events. Phylogenomics showed a higher relatedness to C. septicum than to other so far sequenced genomes of species belonging to the genus Clostridium. Comparative genome analysis of three C. chauvoei circular genome sequences revealed the presence of few inversions and translocations in locally collinear blocks (LCBs). The species genome also shows a large number of genes involved in proteolysis, genes for glycosyl hydrolases and metal iron transportation genes which are presumably involved in virulence and survival in the host. Three conserved flagellar genes (fliC) were identified in each of the circular genomes. In conclusion this is the first comparative analysis of circular genomes for the species C. chauvoei, enabling insights into genome composition and virulence factor variation.

28718764	Genetic interaction screens have aided our understanding of complex genetic traits, diseases, and biological pathways. However, approaches for synthetic genetic analysis with null-alleles in metazoans have not been feasible. Here, we present a CRISPR/Cas9-based Synthetic Genetic Interaction (CRISPR-SGI) approach enabling systematic double-mutant generation. Applying this technique in Caenorhabditis elegans, we comprehensively screened interactions within a set of 14 conserved RNA binding protein genes, generating all possible single and double mutants. Many double mutants displayed fitness defects, revealing synthetic interactions. For one interaction between the MBNL1/2 ortholog mbl-1 and the ELAVL ortholog exc-7, double mutants displayed a severely shortened lifespan. Both genes are required for regulating hundreds of transcripts and isoforms, and both may play a critical role in lifespan extension through insulin signaling. Thus, CRISPR-SGI reveals a rich genetic interaction landscape between RNA binding proteins in maintaining organismal health, and will serve as a paradigm applicable to other biological questions.

28717054	The in vivo imaging of mice makes it possible to analyze disease progress non-invasively through reporter gene expression. As the removal of hair improves the accuracy of in vivo imaging, gene-modified mice with a reporter gene are often crossed with Hos:HR-1 mutant mice homozygous for the spontaneous Hrhr mutation that exhibit a hair loss phenotype. However, it is time consuming to produce mice carrying both the reporter gene and mutant Hrhr gene by mating. In addition, there is a risk that genetic background of the gene-modified mice would be altered by mating. To resolve these issues, we established a simple method to generate hairless mice maintaining the original genetic background by CRISPR technology. First, we constructed the pX330 vector, which targets exon 3 of Hr. This DNA vector (5 ng/µl) was microinjected into the pronuclei of C57BL/6J mice. Induced Hr gene mutations were found in many founders (76.1%) and these mutations were heritable. Next, we performed in vivo imaging using these gene-modified hairless mice. As expected, luminescent objects in their body were detected by in vivo imaging. This study clearly showed that hairless mice could be simply generated by the CRISPR/Cas9 system, and this method may be useful for in vivo imaging studies with various gene-modified mice.

Here, we present CancerGD, a resource that integrates genotypic profiling with large-scale loss-of-function genetic screens in tumor cell lines to identify such genetic dependencies.

CancerGD includes different screen types (siRNA, shRNA, CRISPR), and we describe a simple format for submitting new datasets.	S Bridgett|J Campbell|CJ Lord|CJ Ryan
28706995	CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-Cas9 gene editing technology is derived from a microbial adaptive immune system, where bacteriophages are often the intended target. Natural inhibitors of CRISPR-Cas9 enable phages to evade immunity and show promise in controlling Cas9-mediated gene editing in human cells. However, the mechanism of CRISPR-Cas9 inhibition is not known, and the potential applications for Cas9 inhibitor proteins in mammalian cells have not been fully established. We show that the anti-CRISPR protein AcrIIA4 binds only to assembled Cas9-single-guide RNA (sgRNA) complexes and not to Cas9 protein alone. A 3.9 Å resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of the Cas9-sgRNA-AcrIIA4 complex revealed that the surface of AcrIIA4 is highly acidic and binds with a 1:1 stoichiometry to a region of Cas9 that normally engages the DNA protospacer adjacent motif. Consistent with this binding mode, order-of-addition experiments showed that AcrIIA4 interferes with DNA recognition but has no effect on preformed Cas9-sgRNA-DNA complexes. Timed delivery of AcrIIA4 into human cells as either protein or expression plasmid allows on-target Cas9-mediated gene editing while reducing off-target edits. These results provide a mechanistic understanding of AcrIIA4 function and demonstrate that inhibitors can modulate the extent and outcomes of Cas9-mediated gene editing.

28705673	Staphylococcus epidermidis has been suggested as a main reservoir of methicillin resistance and virulence genes facilitating the evolution of Staphylococcus aureus as a successful pathogen. However, it remains a mystery where and how S. epidermidis obtains these numerous genes to serve as the reservoir. In this study, methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis isolate NW32 from a mastitic milk sample was sequenced and its staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCC) elements were characterised. The SCC composite island covered 3.5% of the genome and consisted of three intact SCC elements carrying resistance genes against β-lactam antibiotics, several heavy metals and polyamines as well as genes for utilisation of sorbitol as a carbon source. Analysis of the postulated evolutionary route suggested that the three SCC elements were assembled from genetic material from various bacterial species (staphylococci, streptococci, salinicocci and Lysinibacillus) from three habitats (human, soil and cow) in different countries (Asia, North America, South America and Europe). We propose that the hsdS restriction-modification profile and the lack of CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat) sequences in this bacterium may facilitate the genetic exchange of SCC elements among different staphylococcal species.

28700943	Activating mutations in the KRAS oncogene are highly prevalent in tumors, especially those of the colon, lung, and pancreas. To better understand the genetic dependencies that K-Ras mutant cells rely upon for their growth, we employed whole-genome CRISPR loss-of-function screens in two isogenic pairs of cell lines. Since loss of essential genes is uniformly toxic in CRISPR-based screens, we also developed a small hairpin RNA (shRNA) library targeting essential genes. These approaches uncovered a large set of proteins whose loss results in the selective reduction of K-Ras mutant cell growth. Pathway analysis revealed that many of these genes function in the mitochondria. For validation, we generated isogenic pairs of cell lines using CRISPR-based genome engineering, which confirmed the dependency of K-Ras mutant cells on these mitochondrial pathways. Finally, we found that mitochondrial inhibitors reduce the growth of K-Ras mutant tumors in vivo, aiding in the advancement of strategies to target K-Ras-driven malignancy.

28700213	Standard approaches for dCas9-based modification of gene expression are limited in the ability to multiplex targets, establish streamlined cassettes, and utilize commonly studied Pol II promoters. In this work, we repurpose the dCas9-VPR activator to act as a dual-mode activator/repressor that can be programmed solely on the basis of target position at gene loci. Furthermore, we implement this approach using a streamlined Pol II-ribozyme system that allows expression of many sgRNAs from a single transcript. By "stepping" dCas9-VPR within the promoter region and ORF we create graded activation and repression (respectively) of target genes, allowing precise control over multiplexed gene modulation. Expression from the Pol II system increased the net amount of sgRNA production in cells by 3.88-fold relative to the Pol III SNR52 promoter, leading to a significant improvement in dCas9-VPR repression strength. Finally, we utilize our Pol II system to create galactose-inducible switching of gene expression states and multiplex constructs capable of modulating up to 4 native genes from a single vector. Our approach represents a significant step toward minimizing DNA required to assemble CRISPR systems in eukaryotes while enhancing the efficacy (greater repression strength), scale (more sgRNAs), and scope (inducibility) of dCas9-mediated gene regulation.

28698278	Cas1 integrase is the key enzyme of the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas adaptation module that mediates acquisition of spacers derived from foreign DNA by CRISPR arrays. In diverse bacteria, the cas1 gene is fused (or adjacent) to a gene encoding a reverse transcriptase (RT) related to group II intron RTs. An RT-Cas1 fusion protein has been recently shown to enable acquisition of CRISPR spacers from RNA. Phylogenetic analysis of the CRISPR-associated RTs demonstrates monophyly of the RT-Cas1 fusion, and coevolution of the RT and Cas1 domains. Nearly all such RTs are present within type III CRISPR-Cas loci, but their phylogeny does not parallel the CRISPR-Cas type classification, indicating that RT-Cas1 is an autonomous functional module that is disseminated by horizontal gene transfer and can function with diverse type III systems. To compare the sequence pools sampled by RT-Cas1-associated and RT-lacking CRISPR-Cas systems, we obtained samples of a commercially grown cyanobacterium-Arthrospira platensis Sequencing of the CRISPR arrays uncovered a highly diverse population of spacers. Spacer diversity was particularly striking for the RT-Cas1-containing type III-B system, where no saturation was evident even with millions of sequences analyzed. In contrast, analysis of the RT-lacking type III-D system yielded a highly diverse pool but reached a point where fewer novel spacers were recovered as sequencing depth was increased. Matches could be identified for a small fraction of the non-RT-Cas1-associated spacers, and for only a single RT-Cas1-associated spacer. Thus, the principal source(s) of the spacers, particularly the hypervariable spacer repertoire of the RT-associated arrays, remains unknown.IMPORTANCE While the majority of CRISPR-Cas immune systems adapt to foreign genetic elements by capturing segments of invasive DNA, some systems carry reverse transcriptases (RTs) that enable adaptation to RNA molecules. From analysis of available bacterial sequence data, we find evidence that RT-based RNA adaptation machinery has been able to join with CRISPR-Cas immune systems in many, diverse bacterial species. To investigate whether the abilities to adapt to DNA and RNA molecules are utilized for defense against distinct classes of invaders in nature, we sequenced CRISPR arrays from samples of commercial-scale open-air cultures of Arthrospira platensis, a cyanobacterium that contains both RT-lacking and RT-containing CRISPR-Cas systems. We uncovered a diverse pool of naturally occurring immune memories, with the RT-lacking locus acquiring a number of segments matching known viral or bacterial genes, while the RT-containing locus has acquired spacers from a distinct sequence pool for which the source remains enigmatic.

28696528	The possibility to predict the outcome of targeted DNA double-stranded break (DSB) repair would be desirable for genome editing. Furthermore the consequences of mis-repair of potentially cell-lethal DSBs and the underlying pathways are not yet fully understood. Here we study the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9-induced mutation spectra at three selected endogenous loci in Arabidopsis thaliana by deep sequencing of long amplicon libraries. Notably, we found sequence-dependent genomic features that affected the DNA repair outcome. Deletions of 1-bp to <1000-bp size and/or very short insertions, deletions >1 kbp (all due to NHEJ) and deletions combined with insertions between 5-bp to >100 bp [caused by a synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA)-like mechanism] occurred most frequently at all three loci. The appearance of single-stranded annealing events depends on the presence and distance between repeats flanking the DSB. The frequency and size of insertions is increased if a sequence with high similarity to the target site was available in cis. Most deletions were linked to pre-existing microhomology. Deletion and/or insertion mutations were blunt-end ligated or via de novo generated microhomology. While most mutation types and, to some degree, their predictability are comparable with animal systems, the broad range of deletion mutations seems to be a peculiar feature of the plant A. thaliana.

28692815	The recent emergence of the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) 9 system has attracted significant attention for its potential to improve traits of agricultural importance. However, most applications in livestock species to date have depended on aberrant DNA repair to generate frameshifting indels. Whether this genomic engineering technique involving homology-dependent repair (HDR) can be used to introduce defined point mutations has been less explored. Previously, we reported a G→A point mutation (g.231A>G, p.Val397Ile) in the growth differentiation factor 9 (GDF9) gene that has a large effect on the litter size of cashmere goats. In the present study we report that by co-injecting synthesised RNAs and single-stranded oligo deoxynucleotide (ssODN) donor sequences into goat zygotes, we successfully introduced defined point mutations resulting in single amino acid substitutions in the proteins as expected. The efficiency of this precise single-nucleotide substitution in newborn kids was as high as 24% (4/17), indicating that ssODN-directed HDR via zygote injection is efficient at introducing point mutations in the goat genome. The findings of the present study further highlight the complex genome modifications facilitated by the CRISPR/Cas9 system, which is able to introduce defined point mutations. This represents a significant development for the improvement of reproduction traits in goats, as well as for validating the roles of specific nucleotides in functional genetic elements in large animals.

28692415	Tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) constitutes around 15-20% of TB cases in immunocompetent individuals. Extrapulmonary sites that are affected by TB include bones, lymph nodes, meningitis, pleura, and genitourinary tract. Whole genome sequencing has emerged as a powerful tool to map genetic diversity among Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) isolates and identify the genomic signatures associated with drug resistance, pathogenesis, and disease transmission. Several pulmonary isolates of MTB have been sequenced over the years. However, availability of whole genome sequences of MTB isolates from extrapulmonary sites is limited. Some studies suggest that genetic variations in MTB might contribute to disease presentation in extrapulmonary sites. This can be addressed if whole genome sequence data from large number of extrapulmonary isolates becomes available. In this study, we have performed whole genome sequencing of five MTB clinical isolates derived from EPTB sites using next-generation sequencing platform. We identified 1434 nonsynonymous single nucleotide variations (SNVs), 143 insertions and 105 deletions. This includes 279 SNVs that were not reported before in publicly available datasets. We found several mutations that are known to confer resistance to drugs. All the five isolates belonged to East-African-Indian lineage (lineage 3). We identified 9 putative prophage DNA integrations and 14 predicted clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) in MTB genome. Our analysis indicates that more work is needed to map the genetic diversity of MTB. Whole genome sequencing in conjunction with comprehensive drug susceptibility testing can reveal clinically relevant mutations associated with drug resistance.

28692085	Protein intrinsic disorder is an important characteristic commonly detected in multifunctional or RNA- and DNA-binding proteins. Due to their high conformational flexibility and solvent accessibility, intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and IDP regions (IDPRs) execute diverse functions including interaction with multiple partners, and are frequently subjected to various post-translational modifications. Recent studies on the components comprising the CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) system have elucidated the crystal structure of Cas9 proteins and the mechanism by which the Cas9-sgRNA complex recognizes and cleaves its target DNA. Yet the extent and functional implications of intrinsic disorder in the Cas9 protein have never been fully assessed. Here, we present a comprehensive computational analysis based on both sequence and structural data in an attempt to investigate the roles of IDPRs in the functioning of Cas9 proteins of different origin. We conclude that among the functional roles of IDPRs in Cas9 proteins are recognition of the target DNA and mediation of nucleic acid and protein binding.	Z Du|VN Uversky

28676344	Back pain is a major contributor to disability and has significant socioeconomic impacts worldwide. The degenerative intervertebral disc (IVD) has been hypothesized to contribute to back pain, but a better understanding of the interactions between the degenerative IVD and nociceptive neurons innervating the disc and treatment strategies that directly target these interactions is needed to improve our understanding and treatment of back pain. We investigated degenerative IVD-induced changes to dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neuron activity and utilized CRISPR epigenome editing as a neuromodulation strategy. By exposing DRG neurons to degenerative IVD-conditioned media under both normal and pathological IVD pH levels, we demonstrate that degenerative IVDs trigger interleukin (IL)-6-induced increases in neuron activity to thermal stimuli, which is directly mediated by AKAP and enhanced by acidic pH. Utilizing this novel information on AKAP-mediated increases in nociceptive neuron activity, we developed lentiviral CRISPR epigenome editing vectors that modulate endogenous expression of AKAP150 by targeted promoter histone methylation. When delivered to DRG neurons, these epigenome-modifying vectors abolished degenerative IVD-induced DRG-elevated neuron activity while preserving non-pathologic neuron activity. This work elucidates the potential for CRISPR epigenome editing as a targeted gene-based pain neuromodulation strategy.	JD Stover|N Farhang|KC Berrett|J Gertz|B Lawrence|RD Bowles
28671645	Scientific knowledge is intrinsically linked to available technologies and methods. This article will present two methods that allowed for the identification and verification of a drug resistance gene in the Apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii, the method of Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) mapping using a Whole Genome Sequence (WGS) -based genetic map and the method of Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 -based gene editing. The approach of QTL mapping allows one to test if there is a correlation between a genomic region(s) and a phenotype. Two datasets are required to run a QTL scan, a genetic map based on the progeny of a recombinant cross and a quantifiable phenotype assessed in each of the progeny of that cross. These datasets are then formatted to be compatible with R/qtl software that generates a QTL scan to identify significant loci correlated with the phenotype. Although this can greatly narrow the search window of possible candidates, QTLs span regions containing a number of genes from which the causal gene needs to be identified. Having WGS of the progeny was critical to identify the causal drug resistance mutation at the gene level. Once identified, the candidate mutation can be verified by genetic manipulation of drug sensitive parasites. The most facile and efficient method to genetically modify T. gondii is the CRISPR/Cas9 system. This system comprised of just 2 components both encoded on a single plasmid, a single guide RNA (gRNA) containing a 20 bp sequence complementary to the genomic target and the Cas9 endonuclease that generates a double-strand DNA break (DSB) at the target, repair of which allows for insertion or deletion of sequences around the break site. This article provides detailed protocols to use CRISPR/Cas9 based genome editing tools to verify the gene responsible for sinefungin resistance and to construct transgenic parasites.

28665998	Igfn1 is a complex locus that codes for multiple splicing variants of Immunoglobulin- and Fibronectin-like domain containing proteins predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle. To reveal possible roles for Igfn1, we applied non-selective knock-down by shRNAs as well as specific targeting of Igfn1 exon 13 by CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis in C2C12 cells. Decreased expression of Igfn1 variants via shRNAs against the common 3'-UTR region caused a total blunting of myoblast fusion, but did not prevent expression of differentiation markers. Targeting of N-terminal domains by elimination of exon 13 via CRISPR/Cas9 mediated homologous recombination, also resulted in fusion defects as well as large multinucleated cells. Expression of IGFN1_v1 partially rescued fusion and myotube morphology in the Igfn1 exon 13 knock-out cell line, indicating a role for this variant in myoblast fusion and differentiation. However, in vivo overexpression of IGFN1_v1 or the Igfn1 Exon 13 CRISPR/Cas9 targeting vector did not result in significant size changes in transfected fibres.

28659385	Primary cilia are microtubule-based sensory organelles necessary for efficient transduction of extracellular cues. To initiate cilia formation, ciliary vesicles (CVs) are transported to the vicinity of the centrosome where they dock to the distal end of the mother centriole and fuse to initiate cilium assembly. However, to this date, the early steps in cilia formation remain incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate functional interplay between CEP19, FOP and CEP350 in ciliogenesis. Using three-dimensional structured-illumination microscopy (3D-SIM) imaging, we mapped the relative spatial distribution of these proteins at the distal end of the mother centriole and show that CEP350/FOP act upstream of CEP19 in their recruitment hierarchy. We demonstrate that CEP19 CRISPR KO cells are severely impaired in their ability to form cilia, analogous to the loss of function of CEP19 binding partners FOP and CEP350. Notably, in the absence of CEP19 microtubule anchoring at centromes is similar in manner to its interaction partners FOP and CEP350. Using GFP-tagged deletion constructs of CEP19, we show that the C-terminus of CEP19 is required for both its localization to centrioles and for its function in ciliogenesis. Critically, this region also mediates the interaction between CEP19 and FOP/CEP350. Interestingly, a morbid-obesity-associated R82* truncated mutant of CEP19 cannot ciliate nor interact with FOP and CEP350, indicative of a putative role for CEP19 in ciliopathies. Finally, analysis of CEP19 KO cells using thin-section electron microscopy revealed marked defects in the docking of CVs to the distal end of the mother centrioles. Together, these data demonstrate a role for the CEP19, FOP and CEP350 module in ciliogenesis and the possible effect of disrupting their functions in ciliopathies.

28654078	The CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering system has revolutionized biology by allowing for precise genome editing with little effort. Guided by a single guide RNA (sgRNA) that confers specificity, the Cas9 protein cleaves both DNA strands at the targeted locus. The DNA break can trigger either non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology directed repair (HDR). NHEJ can introduce small deletions or insertions which lead to frame-shift mutations, while HDR allows for larger and more precise perturbations. Here, we present protocols for generating knockout cell lines by coupling established CRISPR/Cas9 methods with two options for downstream selection/screening. The NHEJ approach uses a single sgRNA cut site and selection-independent screening, where protein production is assessed by dot immunoblot in a high-throughput manner. The HDR approach uses two sgRNA cut sites that span the gene of interest. Together with a provided HDR template, this method can achieve deletion of tens of kb, aided by the inserted selectable resistance marker. The appropriate applications and advantages of each method are discussed.	EL Sternburg|KC Dias|FV Karginov
28654071	CRISPR-associated protein Cpf1 cleaves double-stranded DNA under the guidance of CRISPR RNA (crRNA), generating sticky ends. Because of this characteristic, Cpf1 has been used for the establishment of a DNA assembly standard called C-Brick, which has the advantage of long recognition sites and short scars. On a standard C-Brick vector, there are four Cpf1 recognition sites - the prefix (T1 and T2 sites) and the suffix (T3 and T4 sites) - flanking biological DNA parts. The cleavage of T2 and T3 sites produces complementary sticky ends, which allow for the assembly of DNA parts with T2 and T3 sites. Meanwhile, a short "GGATCC" scar is generated between parts after assembly. As the newly formed plasmid once again contains the four Cpf1 cleavage sites, the method allows for the iterative assembly of DNA parts, which is similar to those of BioBrick and BglBrick standards. A procedure outlining the use of the C-Brick standard to assemble DNA parts is described here. The C-Brick standard can be widely used by scientists, graduate and undergraduate students, and even amateurs.	SY Li|GP Zhao|J Wang
28653169	In 2015 scientists called for a partial ban on genome editing in human germline cells. This call was a response to the rapid development of the CRISPR-Cas9 system, a molecular tool that allows researchers to modify genomic DNA in living organisms with high precision and ease of use. Importantly, the ban was meant to be a trust-building exercise that promises a 'prudent' way forward. The goal of this paper is to analyse whether the ban can deliver on this promise. To do so the focus will be put on the precedent on which the current ban is modelled, namely the Asilomar ban on recombinant DNA technology. The analysis of this case will show (a) that the Asilomar ban was successful because of a specific two-step containment strategy it employed and (b) that this two-step approach is also key to making the current ban work. It will be argued, however, that the Asilomar strategy cannot be transferred to human genome editing and that the current ban therefore fails to deliver on its promise. The paper will close with a reflection on the reasons for this failure and on what can be learned from it about the regulation of novel molecular tools.	S Guttinger
28653114	Precision medicine aims to achieve improved survival by strategies that recognize the genetic and phenotypic individuality of patients and stratify treatment accordingly. Genetic cardiomyopathies represent an ideal disease group to fully embark on this concept: they are in total frequent diseases with a marked morbidity and mortality and there is ample knowledge about their predisposing genetic factors and associated functional mechanisms. The current review highlights the genetic etiology and gives examples of the diverse treatment strategies that are envisaged in the future.	K Filonenko|HA Katus|B Meder
28646206	Haemophilia B, a congenital haemorrhagic disease caused by mutations in coagulation factor IX gene (F9), is considered an appropriate target for genome editing technology. Here, we describe treatment strategies for haemophilia B mice using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9 system. Administration of adeno-associated virus (AAV) 8 vector harbouring Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 (SaCas9) and single guide RNA (sgRNA) to wild-type adult mice induced a double-strand break (DSB) at the target site of F9 in hepatocytes, sufficiently developing haemophilia B. Mutation-specific gene editing by simultaneous induction of homology-directed repair (HDR) sufficiently increased FIX levels to correct the disease phenotype. Insertion of F9 cDNA into the intron more efficiently restored haemostasis via both processes of non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and HDR following DSB. Notably, these therapies also cured neonate mice with haemophilia, which cannot be achieved with conventional gene therapy with AAV vector. Ongoing haemophilia therapy targeting the antithrombin gene with antisense oligonucleotide could be replaced by SaCas9/sgRNA-expressing AAV8 vector. Our results suggest that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing using an AAV8 vector provides a flexible approach to induce DSB at target genes in hepatocytes and could be a good strategy for haemophilia gene therapy.

28646112	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas12a (Cpf1) has emerged as an effective genome editing tool in many organisms. Here, we developed and optimized a CRISPR-Cas12a-assisted recombineering system to facilitate genetic manipulation in bacteria. Using this system, point mutations, deletions, insertions, and gene replacements can be easily generated on the chromosome or native plasmids in Escherichia coli, Yersinia pestis, and Mycobacterium smegmatis Because CRISPR-Cas12a-assisted recombineering does not require introduction of an antibiotic resistance gene into the chromosome to select for recombinants, it is an efficient approach for generating markerless and scarless mutations in bacteria.IMPORTANCE The CRISPR-Cas9 system has been widely used to facilitate genome editing in many bacteria. CRISPR-Cas12a (Cpf1), a new type of CRISPR-Cas system, allows efficient genome editing in bacteria when combined with recombineering. Cas12a and Cas9 recognize different target sites, which allows for more precise selection of the cleavage target and introduction of the desired mutation. In addition, CRISPR-Cas12a-assisted recombineering can be used for genetic manipulation of plasmids and plasmid curing. Finally, Cas12a-assisted recombineering in the generation of point mutations, deletions, insertions, and replacements in bacteria has been systematically analyzed. Taken together, our findings will guide efficient Cas12a-mediated genome editing in bacteria.	MY Yan|HQ Yan|GX Ren|JP Zhao|XP Guo|YC Sun
28646085	The high efficiency of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-mediated mutagenesis in plants enables the development of high-throughput mutagenesis strategies. By transforming pooled CRISPR libraries into tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), collections of mutant lines were generated with minimal transformation attempts and in a relatively short period of time. Identification of the targeted gene(s) was easily determined by sequencing the incorporated guide RNA(s) in the primary transgenic events. From a single transformation with a CRISPR library targeting the immunity-associated leucine-rich repeat subfamily XII genes, heritable mutations were recovered in 15 of the 54 genes targeted. To increase throughput, a second CRISPR library was made containing three guide RNAs per construct to target 18 putative transporter genes. This resulted in stable mutations in 15 of the 18 targeted genes, with some primary transgenic plants having as many as five mutated genes. Furthermore, the redundancy in this collection of plants allowed for the association of aberrant T0 phenotypes with the underlying targeted genes. Plants with mutations in a homolog of an Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) boron efflux transporter displayed boron deficiency phenotypes. The strategy described here provides a technically simple yet high-throughput approach for generating a collection of lines with targeted mutations and should be applicable to any plant transformation system.

28639197	In recent years, Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) system has become the most popular one for genome editing. When the nuclease domains of Cas9 protein are mutated into deactivated form (dCas9), CRISPR/dCas9 still retains the ability to bind the targeted DNA sequence, but loses the endonuclease cleavage activity. Taking advantage of the characteristics of this engineered nuclease inactive Cas9, the CRISPR/dCas system has been repurposed into versatile RNA-guided, DNA-targeting platforms, such as genome imaging, gene regulation, and epigenetic modification. Specifically, fusion of dCas9 with activation domains allows specific and efficient transcriptional activation on a genome-wide scale among diverse organisms. The purpose of this chapter is to review most important the recently published literature on CRISPR/dCas9-based transcriptional activation systems. Compared with the conventional approaches for enhancement of the expression of specific genes of interest, CRISPR/Cas9-based system has emerged as a promising technology for genome regulation, allowing specificity, convenience, robustness, and scalability for endogenous gene activation.

28636969	RNA interference (RNAi) functions as a potent antiviral immunity in plants and invertebrates; however, whether RNAi plays antiviral roles in mammals remains unclear. Here, using human enterovirus 71 (HEV71) as a model, we showed HEV71 3A protein as an authentic viral suppressor of RNAi during viral infection. When the 3A-mediated RNAi suppression was impaired, the mutant HEV71 readily triggered the production of abundant HEV71-derived small RNAs with canonical siRNA properties in cells and mice. These virus-derived siRNAs were produced from viral dsRNA replicative intermediates in a Dicer-dependent manner and loaded into AGO, and they were fully active in degrading cognate viral RNAs. Recombinant HEV71 deficient in 3A-mediated RNAi suppression was significantly restricted in human somatic cells and mice, whereas Dicer deficiency rescued HEV71 infection independently of type I interferon response. Thus, RNAi can function as an antiviral immunity, which is induced and suppressed by a human virus, in mammals.

28634160	Interactions between Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeat (CRISPR) RNAs and CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins form an RNA-guided adaptive immune system in prokaryotes. The adaptive immune system utilizes segments of the genetic material of invasive foreign elements in the CRISPR locus. The loci are transcribed and processed to produce small CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs), with degradation of invading genetic material directed by a combination of complementarity between RNA and DNA and in some cases recognition of adjacent motifs called PAMs (Protospacer Adjacent Motifs). Here we describe a general, high-throughput procedure to test the efficacy of thousands of targets, applying this to the Escherichia coli type I-E Cascade (CRISPR-associated complex for antiviral defense) system. These studies were followed with reciprocal experiments in which the consequence of CRISPR activity was survival in the presence of a lytic phage. From the combined analysis of the Cascade system, we found that (i) type I-E Cascade PAM recognition is more expansive than previously reported, with at least 22 distinct PAMs, with many of the noncanonical PAMs having CRISPR-interference abilities similar to the canonical PAMs; (ii) PAM positioning appears precise, with no evidence for tolerance to PAM slippage in interference; and (iii) while increased guanine-cytosine (GC) content in the spacer is associated with higher CRISPR-interference efficiency, high GC content (>62.5%) decreases CRISPR-interference efficiency. Our findings provide a comprehensive functional profile of Cascade type I-E interference requirements and a method to assay spacer efficacy that can be applied to other CRISPR-Cas systems.

28633563	The programming of new functions into mammalian cells has tremendous application in research and medicine. Continued improvements in the capacity to sequence and synthesize DNA have rapidly increased our understanding of mechanisms of gene function and regulation on a genome-wide scale and have expanded the set of genetic components available for programming cell biology. The invention of new research tools, including targetable DNA-binding systems such as CRISPR/Cas9 and sensor-actuator devices that can recognize and respond to diverse chemical, mechanical, and optical inputs, has enabled precise control of complex cellular behaviors at unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. These tools have been critical for the expansion of synthetic biology techniques from prokaryotic and lower eukaryotic hosts to mammalian systems. Recent progress in the development of genome and epigenome editing tools and in the engineering of designer cells with programmable genetic circuits is expanding approaches to prevent, diagnose, and treat disease and to establish personalized theranostic strategies for next-generation medicines. This review summarizes the development of these enabling technologies and their application to transforming mammalian synthetic biology into a distinct field in research and medicine.

28631420	PTEN is a tumour suppressor that is frequently mutated in a variety of cancers. Hence, PTEN has significant potential as a therapeutic molecule. PTEN-long is an alternative translation variant, with an additional 173 amino acids added to the N-terminal of the canonical PTEN when CUG of the mRNA is utilized as the start codon. PTEN-long is secreted into serum and can re-enter cells throughout the body. One of the major barriers for gene therapy is to efficiently and specifically deliver DNA or RNA material to target cells. As an alternative approach, if a therapeutic protein can be directly delivered to target cell of interest, it should theoretically function well within the cells, particularly for genes that are deficiently expressed in vivo. Most therapeutic proteins are incapable of efficiently permeating the cell membrane. In this study, we have employed CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing tool combined with single-stranded template to edit CTG of PTEN-long to ATG in the genome. Two guide RNAs close to CTG site were found to have similar efficiency in driving PTEN-long expression. Furthermore, we detected PTEN-long expression in transfected whole-cell lysate and in concentrated culture media in Western blot. Interestingly, the culture media of PTEN-long expression can reduce Akt phosphorylation level and repress U87 cell proliferation compared to wild-type U87 or control media. Taken together, PTEN-long driven by CRISPR/Cas9 imports and exports cells and represses nearby cell proliferation, indicating the PTEN-long generated by CRISPR/Cas9 has potential to be an alternative strategy for PTEN gene therapy.

28631377	Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) comprise a vast repertoire of RNAs playing a wide variety of crucial roles in tissue physiology in a cell-specific manner. Despite being engaged in myriads of regulatory mechanisms, many lncRNAs have still remained to be assigned any functions. A constellation of experimental techniques including single-molecule RNA in situ hybridization (sm-RNA FISH), cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP), RNA interference (RNAi), Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and so forth has been employed to shed light on lncRNA cellular localization, structure, interaction networks and functions. Here, we review these and other experimental approaches in common use for identification and characterization of lncRNAs, particularly those involved in different types of cancer, with focus on merits and demerits of each technique.

28628097	Cpf1 is a CRISPR effector protein that has greater specificity than Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) in genome-editing applications. Here we show that Lachnospiraceae bacterium (Lb) and Acidaminococus sp. (As) Cpf1 orthologs have RNase activities that can excise multiple CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) from a single RNA polymerase II-driven RNA transcript expressed in mammalian cells. This property simplifies modification of multiple genomic targets and can be used to increase the efficiency of Cpf1-mediated editing.	G Zhong|H Wang|Y Li|MH Tran|M Farzan
28627393	Current antiviral therapy fails to cure chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, primarily because of the persistence of covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA). Although nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs) can inhibit the reverse transcriptase of HBV and suppress its replication to levels below the detection limit, viremia often rebounds after cessation of therapy. Nuclear cccDNA serves as the HBV replicative template and exhibits extraordinary stability, and is not affected by NAs. Therefore, curing chronic hepatitis B (CHB) requires novel therapy for purging cccDNA from patients. The CRISPR/Cas9 system is a newly developed programmable genome-editing tool and allows for sequence-specific cleavage of DNA. Compared to other genome-editing tools, the CRIPSR/Cas9 system is advantageous for its simplicity and flexibility of design. Theoretically, Cas9 can be redirected to specifically cleave any desired genome sequences simply by designing guide RNAs with about 20 nucleotides that match the particular sequences of genomes with downstream protospacer adjacent motifs. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the CRIPSR/Cas9 system can specifically destruct HBV genomes in vitro and in vivo. Although promising, the CRISPR/Cas9 system faces several challenges that need to be overcome for the clinical application, namely, off-target cleavage and the in vivo delivery efficiency. Cutting integrated HBV genomes by CRISPR/Cas9 also raises serious concern because this has the risk of genome instability. In summary, the CRISPR/Cas9 system bears the potential for curing CHB as long as several challenging issues can be successfully solved.	HC Yang|PJ Chen
28625976	Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a malignant hematopoietic disease and the most common type of acute leukemia in adults. The mechanisms underlying drug resistance in AML are poorly understood. Activating mutations in FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) are the most common molecular abnormality in AML. Quizartinib (AC220) is a potent and selective second-generation inhibitor of FLT3. It is in clinical trials for the treatment of relapsed or refractory FLT3-ITD-positive and -negative AML patients and as maintenance therapy. To understand the mechanisms of drug resistance to AC220, we undertook an unbiased approach with a novel CRISPR-pooled library to screen new genes whose loss of function confers resistance to AC220. We identified SPRY3, an intracellular inhibitor of FGF signaling, and GSK3, a canonical Wnt signaling antagonist, and demonstrated reactivation of downstream FGF/Ras/ERK and Wnt signaling as major mechanisms of resistance to AC220. We confirmed these findings in primary AML patient samples. Expression of SPRY3 and GSK3A was dramatically reduced in AC220-resistant AML samples, and SPRY3-deleted primary AML cells were resistant to AC220. Intriguingly, expression of SPRY3 was greatly reduced in GSK3 knockout AML cells, which positioned SPRY3 downstream of GSK3 in the resistance pathway. Taken together, our study identified novel genes whose loss of function conferred resistance to a selective FLT3 inhibitor, providing new insight into signaling pathways that contribute to acquired resistance in AML.

28625156	The most common gene editing methods, such as CRISPR, involve random repair of an induced double-stranded DNA break through the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair pathway, resulting in small insertions/deletions. In diploid cells, these mutations can take on one of three zygosities: monoallelic, diallelic heterozygous, or diallelic homozygous. While many advances have been made in CRISPR delivery systems and gene editing efficiency, little work has been done to streamline detection of gene editing events. The only current method to determine the zygosity of an edited gene in a diploid organism is DNA sequencing, which is costly and time-consuming. Here, we describe the development of a T7 endonuclease I (T7EI)-based heteroduplex cleavage assay, along with statistical models relating the percentage of cleaved DNA to the zygosity of a mutation, that provides a rapid screening step prior to DNA sequencing. By isolating candidates likely to contain the desired zygosity for the edited gene, our screening method can decrease the number of clones requiring DNA sequencing.	KD Luttgeharm|KS Wong|S Siembieda

28623876	Genome-editing tools are programmable artificial nucleases, mainly including zinc-finger nucleases, transcription activator-like effector nucleases and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR). By recognizing and cleaving specific DNA sequences, genome-editing tools make it possible to generate site-specific DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in the genome. DSBs will then be repaired by either error-prone nonhomologous end joining or high-fidelity homologous recombination mechanisms. Through these two different mechanisms, endogenous genes can be knocked out or precisely repaired/modified. Rapid developments in genome-editing tools, especially CRISPR, have revolutionized human disease models generation, for example, various zebrafish, mouse, rat, pig, monkey and human cell lines have been constructed. Here, we review the developmental history of CRISPR and its application in studies of human diseases. In addition, we also briefly discussed the therapeutic application of CRISPR in the near future.

28623373	Ferroplasmaceae represent ubiquitous iron-oxidising extreme acidophiles with a number of unique physiological traits. In a genome-based study of Ferroplasma acidiphilum YT, the only species of the genus Ferroplasma with a validly published name, we assessed its central metabolism and genome stability during a long-term cultivation experiment. Consistently with physiology, the genome analysis points to F. acidiphilum YT having an obligate peptidolytic oligotrophic lifestyle alongside with anaplerotic carbon assimilation. This narrow trophic specialisation abridges the sugar uptake, although all genes for glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, including bifunctional unidirectional fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase/phosphatase, have been identified. Pyruvate and 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenases are substituted by 'ancient' CoA-dependent pyruvate and alpha-ketoglutarate ferredoxin oxidoreductases. In the lab culture, after ~550 generations, the strain exhibited the mutation rate of ≥1.3 × 10-8 single nucleotide substitutions per site per generation, which is among the highest values recorded for unicellular organisms. All but one base substitutions were G:C to A:T, their distribution between coding and non-coding regions and synonymous-to-non-synonymous mutation ratios suggest the neutral drift being a prevalent mode in genome evolution in the lab culture. Mutations in nature seem to occur with lower frequencies, as suggested by a remarkable genomic conservation in F. acidiphilum YT variants from geographically distant populations.

28620688	Microbial polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) are a family of biopolyesters with properties similar to petroleum plastics such as polyethylene (PE) or polypropylene (PP). Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) is the most common PHA known so far. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats interference (CRISPRi), a technology recently developed to control gene expression levels in eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes, was employed to regulate PHB synthase activity influencing PHB synthesis. Recombinant Escherichia coli harboring an operon of three PHB synthesis genes phaCAB cloned from Ralstonia eutropha, was transformed with various single guided RNA (sgRNA with its guide sequence of 20-23 bases) able to bind to various locations of the PHB synthase PhaC, respectively. Depending on the binding location and the number of sgRNA on phaC, CRISPRi was able to control the phaC transcription and thus PhaC activity. It was found that PHB content, molecular weight, and polydispersity were approximately in direct and reverse proportion to the PhaC activity, respectively. The higher the PhaC activity, the more the intracellular PHB accumulation, yet the less the PHB molecular weights and the wider the polydispersity. This study allowed the PHB contents to be controlled in the ranges of 1.47-75.21% cell dry weights, molecular weights from 2 to 6 millions Dalton and polydispersity of 1.2 to 1.43 in 48 h shake flask studies. This result will be very important for future development of ultrahigh molecular weight PHA useful to meet high strength application requirements.	D Li|L Lv|JC Chen|GQ Chen
28619172	Salmonella enterica serovar Gallinarum biovar Pullorum (S. Pullorum) is the cause of pullorum disease, characterized by white diarrhea, which leads to high mortality in poultry. In this study, we aimed to assess the genetic diversity of 655 S. Pullorum strains from 1962 to 2015 in China, Europe, and South America. A sequence typing scheme based on clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) was used to reveal the genetic relationships among these strains in this study. Overall, a total of 20 Pullorum sequence types (PSTs) of CRISPR were identified in the 655 isolates with PST7 (74%, 486/655) and PST3 (13%, 86/655) to be the most two frequent PSTs belonging to two different lineages, which confirmed the genetic conservation of S. Pullorum strains isolated from six provinces and two direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing and Shanghai) in China. However, the identification of seven new PSTs distributed in strains isolated since 2001 implied that genetic variation continues to develop in S. Pullorum. Interestingly, the whole-genome single-nucleotide polymorphism typing (WGST) of 96 strains out of the 655 isolates divided them into four lineages based on SNP analysis of core genomic sequence and exhibit good correspondence with the CRISPR subtyping method. Notably, 22 out of 26 isolates from Europe and South America were distributed in five distinctive PSTs (with no Chinese strains). Additionally, CRISPR data of spacers and their arrangement exhibit subtle but distinct specificity between different strains, and the dynamic adaptive nature of CRISPR loci provides critical insights into the evolution of S. Pullorum as the bacteria are influenced by their environment.	X Xie|Y Hu|Y Xu|K Yin|Y Li|Y Chen|J Xia|L Xu|Z Liu|S Geng|Q Li|X Jiao|X Chen|Z Pan
28613254	Fanconi anemia (FA) is an inherited condition characterized by impaired DNA repair, physical anomalies, bone marrow failure, and increased incidence of malignancy. Gene editing holds great potential to precisely correct the underlying genetic cause such that gene expression remains under the endogenous control mechanisms. This has been accomplished to date only in transformed cells or their reprogrammed induced pluripotent stem cell counterparts; however, it has not yet been reported in primary patient cells. Here we show the ability to correct a mutation in Fanconi anemia D1 (FANCD1) primary patient fibroblasts. The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 system was employed to target and correct a FANCD1 gene deletion. Homologous recombination using an oligonucleotide donor was achieved and a pure population of modified cells was obtained by using inhibitors of poly adenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase (poly ADP-ribose polymerase). FANCD1 function was restored and we did not observe any promiscuous cutting of the CRISPR/Cas9 at off target sites. This consideration is crucial in the context of the pre-malignant FA phenotype. Altogether we show the ability to correct a patient mutation in primary FANCD1 cells in a precise manner. These proof of principle studies support expanded application of gene editing for FA.

28613045	Genome editing with engineered nucleases is a rapidly growing field thanks to transformative technologies that allow researchers to precisely alter genomes for numerous applications including basic research, biotechnology, and human gene therapy. The genome editing process relies on creating a site-specific DNA double-strand break (DSB) by engineered nucleases and then allowing the cell's repair machinery to repair the break such that precise changes are made to the DNA sequence. The recent development of CRISPR-Cas systems as easily accessible and programmable tools for genome editing accelerates the progress towards using genome editing as a new approach to human therapeutics. Here we review how genome editing using engineered nucleases works and how using different genome editing outcomes can be used as a tool set for treating human diseases. We then review the major challenges of therapeutic genome editing and we discuss how its potential enhancement through CRISPR guide RNA and Cas9 protein modifications could resolve some of these challenges.

28611475	Inherited mutations in lipopolysaccharide-responsive beige-like anchor (LRBA) cause a recessive human immune dysregulation syndrome with memory B-cell and antibody deficiency (common variable immunodeficiency), inflammatory bowel disease, enlarged spleen and lymph nodes, accumulation of activated T cells and multiple autoimmune diseases. To understand the pathogenesis of the syndrome, C57BL/6 mice carrying a homozygous truncating mutation in Lrba were produced using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene targeting. These mice revealed that LRBA has a critical, cell-autonomous role in promoting cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) accumulation within CD4 effector T cells and FOXP3+ T-regulatory cells (Tregs). In young mice, or in chimeric mice where only half of the T cells are LRBA deficient, low CTLA-4 was the only detectable abnormality in Tregs, whereas in old mice FOXP3 was also decreased. Low CTLA-4 did not translate into increased CD86 on B cells unless the LRBA-deficient mice were immunised, and neither immunisation nor chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection precipitated immune dysregulation. LRBA deficiency did not alter antigen-specific B-cell activation, germinal centre (GC) formation, isotype switching or affinity maturation. Paradoxically, CD86 was decreased on GC B cells in LRBA-deficient mice, pointing to compensatory mechanisms for controlling CD86 in the face of low CTLA-4. These results add to the experimental rationale for treating LRBA deficiency with the CTLA4-Ig fusion protein, Abatacept, and pose questions about the limitations of laboratory experiments in mice to reproduce human disease in natura.

28610635	Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a disorder of red blood cells (RBCs) expressing abnormal hemoglobin-S (HbS) due to genetic inheritance of homologous HbS gene. However, people with the sickle cell trait (SCT) carry a single allele of HbS and do not usually suffer from SCD symptoms, thus providing a rationale to treat SCD.	To validate gene therapy potential, hematopoietic stem cells were isolated from the SCD patient blood and treated with CRISPR/Cas9 approach. To precisely dissect genome-editing effects, erythroid progenitor cells were cloned from single colonies of CRISPR-treated cells and then expanded for simultaneous gene, protein, and cellular function studies.	Genotyping and sequencing analysis revealed that the genome-edited erythroid progenitor colonies were converted to SCT genotype from SCD genotype. HPLC protein assays confirmed reinstallation of normal hemoglobin at a similar level with HbS in the cloned genome-edited erythroid progenitor cells. For cell function evaluation, in vitro RBC differentiation of the cloned erythroid progenitor cells was induced. As expected, cell sickling assays indicated function reinstitution of the genome-edited offspring SCD RBCs, which became more resistant to sickling under hypoxia condition.	This study is an exploration of genome editing of SCD HSPCs.	J Wen|W Tao|S Hao|Y Zu
28603699	Biofilm is a sessile bacterial accretion embedded in self-producing matrix. It is the root cause of about 80% microbial infections in human. Among them, E. coli biofilms are most prevalent in medical devices associated nosocomial infections. The objective of this study was to inhibit biofilm formation by targeting gene involved in quorum sensing, one of the main mechanisms of biofilm formation. Hence we have introduced the CRISPRi, first time to target luxS gene. luxS is a synthase, involved in the synthesis of Autoinducer-2(AI-2), which in turn guides the initial stage of biofilm formation. To implement CRISPRi system for luxS gene suppression, we have synthesized complementary sgRNA to target gene sequence and co-expressed with dCas9, a mutated form of an endonuclease. Suppression of luxS expression was confirmed through qRT-PCR. The effect of luxS gene on biofilm inhibition was studied through crystal violet assay, XTT reduction assay and scanning electron microscopy. We conclude that CRISPRi system could be a potential strategy to inhibit bacterial biofilm through mechanism base approach.	A Zuberi|L Misba|AU Khan
28602637	Prokaryotic CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune systems utilize sequence-specific RNA-guided endonucleases to defend against infection by viruses, bacteriophages, and mobile elements, while these foreign genetic elements evolve diverse anti-CRISPR proteins to overcome the CRISPR-Cas-mediated defense of the host. Recently, AcrIIA2 and AcrIIA4, encoded by Listeria monocytogene prophages, were shown to block the endonuclease activity of type II-A Streptococcus pyogene Cas9 (SpyCas9). We now report the crystal structure of AcrIIA4 in complex with single-guide RNA-bound SpyCas9, thereby establishing that AcrIIA4 preferentially targets critical residues essential for PAM duplex recognition, as well as blocks target DNA access to key catalytic residues lining the RuvC pocket. These structural insights, validated by biochemical assays on key mutants, demonstrate that AcrIIA4 competitively occupies both PAM-interacting and non-target DNA strand cleavage catalytic pockets. Our studies provide insights into anti-CRISPR-mediated suppression mechanisms for inactivating SpyCas9, thereby broadening the applicability of CRISPR-Cas regulatory tools for genome editing.

28602403	The elucidation of the CRISPR (clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats) adaptive immune system endogenous to most microbial life has culminated in progress in a diversity of scientific disciplines. The concurrently promising and eccentric nature of its theoretically plausible applications has wrought enthusiasm in the research community globally, potentiating advancements in human and animal health, ecological stability, and economic wellbeing, that would hitherto be considered the unattainable fancies of a futurist. It may be supposed that the tomes of science fiction are the true books of prophecy. Here, we narrate the scientific dialogue regarding CRISPR/Cas biotechnologies, from the happenstantial initial observation of the locus to the litany of intriguing contemporary endeavors. We discuss the mechanistic underpinnings in detail, and the corpulent body of literature on CRISPR-based biotech is digested into a germane and informative review. CRISPR applications such as microbiome engineering in order to enhance the human immune system beyond the fortitude of the wild type, bacterial genome editing in industrial and medical aspects, conquering antibiotic resistance, the development of novel antimicrobial techniques, the harvesting of solventogenic microbes, the development of antifungal therapies, and investigation of the genetic properties of fungi, are here represented, and the authors posit unconventional, and at times gainfully tangential, thoughts and concepts in order to encourage a reflective disposition towards this sophisticated device of nature: a panacea in progress, such that the most impassive and technical writing still carries the ring of poetry.

28601970	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) coupled with CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins (CRISPR/Cas) are the adaptive immune system of eubacteria and archaebacteria. This system provides protection of bacteria against invading foreign DNA, such as transposons, bacteriophages and plasmids. Three-stage processes in this system for immunity against foreign DNAs are defined as adaptation, expression and interference. Recent studies suggested a correlation between the interfering of the CRISPR/Cas locus, acquisition of antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity island. In this review article, we demonstrate and discuss the CRISPR/Cas system's roles in interference with acquisition of antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity island in some eubacteria. Totally, these systems function as the adaptive immune system of bacteria against invading foreign DNA, blocking the acquisition of antibiotic resistance and virulence factor, detecting serotypes, indirect effects of CRISPR self-targeting, associating with physiological functions, associating with infections in humans at the transmission stage, interfering with natural transformation, a tool for genome editing in genome engineering, monitoring foodborne pathogens etc. These results showed that the CRISPR/Cas system might prevent the emergence of virulence both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, this system was shown to be a strong selective pressure for the acquisition of antibiotic resistance and virulence factor in bacterial pathogens.

28599597	Previous research has proven that disruption of either the CCR5 or the CXCR4 gene confers resistance to R5-tropic or X4-tropic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, respectively. However, the urgent need to ablate both of the co-receptors in individual post-thymic CD4+ T cells for dual protection remains. This study ablated the CCR5 and CXCR4 genes in human CD4+ cell lines and primary CD4+ T cells simultaneously using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9, a well-developed, highly efficient genetic engineering tool. The efficiency of gene modification is as high as 55% for CCR5 and 36% for CXCR4 in CD4+ cell lines through infection of a single lentiviral vector (LV-X4R5), which were markedly protected from both HIV-1NL4-3 (X4-using strain) and HIV-1YU-2 (R5-using strain) infection. Importantly, approximately 9% of the modified GHOST (3) CXCR4+CCR5+ cells harbor four bi-allelic gene disruptions in both the CXCR4 and CCR5 loci. Moreover, co-delivery of two single-guide RNAs loaded with Cas9: ribonucleoprotein (sgX4&R5 Cas9RNP) disrupted >12% of CCR5 and 10% of CXCR4 in primary human CD4+ T cells, which were rendered resistant to HIV-1NL4-3 and HIV-1YU-2 in vitro. Further, the modified cells do not show discernible mutagenesis in top-ranked off-target genes by the Surveyor assay and Sanger sequencing analysis. The results demonstrate the safety and efficacy of CRISPR/Cas9 in multiplex gene modification on peripherally circulating CD4+ T cells, which may promote a functional cure for HIV-1 infection.

28595896	The RNA-guided Cpf1 nuclease cleaves double-stranded DNA targets complementary to the CRISPR RNA (crRNA), and it has been harnessed for genome editing technologies. Recently, Acidaminococcus sp. BV3L6 (AsCpf1) was engineered to recognize altered DNA sequences as the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), thereby expanding the target range of Cpf1-mediated genome editing. Whereas wild-type AsCpf1 recognizes the TTTV PAM, the RVR (S542R/K548V/N552R) and RR (S542R/K607R) variants can efficiently recognize the TATV and TYCV PAMs, respectively. However, their PAM recognition mechanisms remained unknown. Here we present the 2.0 Å resolution crystal structures of the RVR and RR variants bound to a crRNA and its target DNA. The structures revealed that the RVR and RR variants primarily recognize the PAM-complementary nucleotides via the substituted residues. Our high-resolution structures delineated the altered PAM recognition mechanisms of the AsCpf1 variants, providing a basis for the further engineering of CRISPR-Cpf1.

28591848	Bacteria have numerous strategies to interact with themselves and with their environment, but genes associated with these interactions are usually cataloged as pathogenic. To understand the role that these genes have not only in pathogenesis but also in bacterial interactions, we compared the genomes of eight bacteria from human-impacted environments with those of free-living bacteria from the Cuatro Ciénegas Basin (CCB), a relatively pristine oligotrophic site. Fifty-one genomes from CCB bacteria, including Pseudomonas, Vibrio, Photobacterium and Aeromonas, were analyzed. We found that the CCB strains had several virulence-related genes, 15 of which were common to all strains and were related to flagella and chemotaxis. We also identified the presence of Type III and VI secretion systems, which leads us to propose that these systems play an important role in interactions among bacterial communities beyond pathogenesis. None of the CCB strains had pathogenicity islands, despite having genes associated with antibiotics. Integrons were rare, while CRISPR elements were common. The idea that pathogenicity-related genes in many cases form part of a wider strategy used by bacteria to interact with other organisms could help us to understand the role of pathogenicity-related elements in an ecological and evolutionary framework leading toward a more inclusive One Health concept.

28590031	Based on the tremendous progress of the understanding on the CRISPR-Cas systems, the application CRISPR/Cas technology has been extended into increasing scenarios in biological and biomedical investigation. The potency of gene editing has been greatly improved by the rapid development of engineered Cas9 variants and modified CRISPR platforms.

28589392	The widespread use of CRISPR/Cas and other targeted endonuclease technologies in many species has led to an explosion in the generation of new mutations and alleles. The ability to generate many different mutations from the same target sequence either by homology-directed repair with a donor sequence or non-homologous end joining-induced insertions and deletions necessitates a means for representing these mutations in literature and databases. Standardized nomenclature can be used to generate unambiguous, concise, and specific symbols to represent mutations and alleles. The research communities of a variety of species using CRISPR/Cas and other endonuclease-mediated mutation technologies have developed different approaches to naming and identifying such alleles and mutations. While some organism-specific research communities have developed allele nomenclature that incorporates the method of generation within the official allele or mutant symbol, others use metadata tags that include method of generation or mutagen. Organism-specific research community databases together with organism-specific nomenclature committees are leading the way in providing standardized nomenclature and metadata to facilitate the integration of data from alleles and mutations generated using CRISPR/Cas and other targeted endonucleases.

28587596	CRISPR is a versatile gene editing tool which has revolutionized genetic research in the past few years. Optimizing sgRNA design to improve the efficiency of target/DNA cleavage is critical to ensure the success of CRISPR screens.	By borrowing knowledge from oligonucleotide design and nucleosome occupancy models, we systematically evaluated candidate features computed from a number of nucleic acid, thermodynamic and secondary structure models on real CRISPR datasets. Our results showed that taking into account position-dependent dinucleotide features improved the design of effective sgRNAs with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) >0.8, and the inclusion of additional features offered marginal improvement (∼2% increase in AUC).	Using a machine-learning approach, we proposed an accurate prediction model for sgRNA design efficiency. An R package predictSGRNA implementing the predictive model is available at http://www.ams.sunysb.edu/~pfkuan/softwares.html#predictsgrna .	PF Kuan|S Powers|S He|K Li|X Zhao|B Huang
28584995	As one of the most common airborne fungal pathogenic species, Aspergillus fumigatus infection is the increasingly fatal threat to immunocompromised patients worldwide. Setting up an efficient live-cell pathogen-labeling system will give insight into the dynamic process of the pathogen invasion in host, which offers us opportunities to explore the pathogenesis of A. fumigatus. In this chapter, we have described an efficient CRISPR-Cas9 system, which enables a precise in situ tag-insertion of an exogenous GFP tag at the predicted site with or without marker insertion in A. fumigatus. According to the detectable proportional fluorescence intensity, it is possible to in vivo track the A. fumigatus infection and to assess the fungal burden in relative organs.	C Zhang|L Lu
28581909	Clustered regulatory interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR associated nuclease 9 (Cas9) system of targeted genome editing has already revolutionized the plant science research. This is a RNA guided programmable endonuclease based system composed of 2 components, the Cas9 nuclease and an engineered guide RNA targeting any DNA sequence of the form N20-NGG for novel genome editing applications. The CRISPR/Cas9 technology of targeted genome editing has been recently applied for imparting virus resistance in plants. The robustness, wide adaptability, and easy engineering of this system has proved its potential as an antiviral tool for plants. Novel DNA free genome editing by using the preassembled Cas9/gRNA ribonucleoprotein complex for development of virus resistance in any plant species have been prospected for the future. Also, in this review we have discussed the reports of CRISPR/Cas9 mediated virus resistance strategy against geminiviruses by targeting the viral genome and transgene free strategy against RNA viruses by targeting the host plant factors. In conclusion, CRISPR/Cas9 technology will provide a more durable and broad spectrum viral resistance in agriculturally important crops which will eventually lead to public acceptance and commercialization in the near future.

28581493	CRISPR-Cas9-induced DNA damage may have deleterious effects at high-copy-number genomic regions. Here, we use CRISPR base editors to knock out genes by changing single nucleotides to create stop codons. We show that the CRISPR-STOP method is an efficient and less deleterious alternative to wild-type Cas9 for gene-knockout studies. Early stop codons can be introduced in ∼17,000 human genes. CRISPR-STOP-mediated targeted screening demonstrates comparable efficiency to WT Cas9, which indicates the suitability of our approach for genome-wide functional screenings.

28574731	This year marks the Eighth Review Conference (RevCon) of the Biological Toxins and Weapons Convention (BWC). At the same time, ongoing international efforts to further and more deeply investigate the brain's complex neuronal circuitry are creating unprecedented capabilities to both understand and control neurological processes of thought, emotion, and behavior. These advances have tremendous promise for human health, but the potential for their misuse has also been noted, with most discussions centering on research and development of agents that are addressed by existing BWC and Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) proscriptions. In this article, we discuss the dual-use possibilities fostered by employing emergent biotechnologic techniques and tools-specifically, novel gene editors like clustered regular interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-to produce neuroweapons. Based on our analyses, we posit the strong likelihood that development of genetically modified or created neurotropic substances will advance apace with other gene-based therapeutics, and we assert that this represents a novel-and realizable-path to creating potential neuroweapons. In light of this, we propose that it will be important to re-address current categorizations of weaponizable tools and substances, so as to better inform and generate tractable policy to enable improved surveillance and governance of novel neuroweapons.

28573409	The possibility to generate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) opens the way to generate virtually all cell types of our human body. In combination with modern gene editing techniques like CRISPR/CAS, a new set of powerful tools becomes available for life science. Scientific fields like genotype and cell type-specific pharmacology, disease modeling, stem cell biology, and developmental biology have been dramatically fostered and their faces have been changed. However, as golden as the age of iPSC-derived cells and their manipulation has started, the shine begins to tarnish. Researchers face more and more practical problems intrinsic to the system. These problems are related to the specific culturing conditions which are not yet sufficient to mimic the natural environment of native stem cells differentiating towards adult cells. However, researchers work hard to uncover these factors. Here, we review a common standard approach to generate iPSCs and transduce these to iPSC cardiomyocytes. Further, we review recent achievements and discuss their current limitations and future perspectives. We are on track, but the road is still under construction.

28558198	An ideal in vivo gene therapy platform provides safe, reprogrammable, and precise strategies which modulate cell and tissue gene regulatory networks with a high temporal and spatial resolution. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR), a bacterial adoptive immune system, and its CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9), have gained attention for the ability to target and modify DNA sequences on demand with unprecedented flexibility and precision. The precision and programmability of Cas9 is derived from its complexation with a guide-RNA (gRNA) that is complementary to a desired genomic sequence. CRISPR systems open-up widespread applications including genetic disease modeling, functional screens, and synthetic gene regulation. The plausibility of in vivo genetic engineering using CRISPR has garnered significant traction as a next generation in vivo therapeutic. However, there are hurdles that need to be addressed before CRISPR-based strategies are fully implemented. Some key issues center on the controllability of the CRISPR platform, including minimizing genomic-off target effects and maximizing in vivo gene editing efficiency, in vivo cellular delivery, and spatial-temporal regulation. The modifiable components of CRISPR systems: Cas9 protein, gRNA, delivery platform, and the form of CRISPR system delivered (DNA, RNA, or ribonucleoprotein) have recently been engineered independently to design a better genome engineering toolbox. This review focuses on evaluating CRISPR potential as a next generation in vivo gene therapy platform and discusses bioengineering advancements that can address challenges associated with clinical translation of this emerging technology.

28550913	Nuclease-based genome editing has rapidly sped the creation of new models of human disease. These techniques also hold great promise for the future of clinical xenotransplantation and cell-based therapies for cancer or immunodeficient pathology. However, to fully realize the potential of nuclease editing tools, the efficiency and precision of their application must be optimized. The object of this study was to use nonintegrating selection and nuclease-directed homologous recombination to efficiently control the genetic modification of the porcine genome.	Clustered randomly integrating spaced palindromic repeats and associated Cas9 protein (CRISPR/Cas9)-directed mutagenesis with a single-guide RNA target was designed to target the alpha-1,3-galactosyltransferase locus (GGTA1) of the porcine genome. A vector expressing a single-guide RNA, Cas9 protein, and green fluorescent protein was used to increase plasmid-delivered mutational efficiency when coupled with fluorescence sorting. Single and double-strand DNA oligonucleotides with a restriction site replacing the start codon were created with variable homology lengths surrounding the mutational event site. Finally, a transgene construct was flanked with 50 base pairs of homology directed immediately 5' to a nuclease cut site. These products were introduced to cells with a constant concentration of CRISPR/cas9 vector. Phenotype-specific mutational efficiency was measured by flow cytometer. Controlled homologous insertion was measured by Sanger sequence, restriction enzyme digest and flow cytometry.	Expression of a fluorescence protein on the Cas9 vector functioned as a nonintegrating selection marker. Selection by this marker increased phenotype-silencing mutation rates from 3.5% to 82% (P = 0.0002). Insertion or deletion mutation increased from 11% to 96% (P = 0.0007). Co-transfection with homologous DNA oligonucleotides increased the aggregate phenotype-silencing mutation rates up to 22% and increased biallelic events. Single-strand DNA was twice as efficient as double-strand DNA. Furthermore, nuclease-mediated insertion by homology-directed repair successfully drove locus-specific transgene expression in the porcine genome.	A nonintegrating selection strategy based on fluorescence expression can increase the mutational efficiency of the CRISPR/Cas9 system. The precision of this system can be increased by the addition of a very short homologous template sequence and can serve as a method for locus-specific transgene delivery. Together these strategies may be used to efficiently control mutational events. This system may be used to better use the potential of nuclease-mediated genomic editing.

28544656	Chlamydiaceae are bacterial pathogens that cause diverse diseases in humans and animals. Despite their broad host and tissue tropism, all Chlamydia species share an obligate intracellular cycle of development and have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to interact with their eukaryotic host cells. Here, we have analysed interactions of the zoonotic pathogen Chlamydia psittaci with a human epithelial cell line. We found that C. psittaci recruits the ceramide transport protein (CERT) to its inclusion. Chemical inhibition and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of CERT showed that CERT is a crucial factor for C. psittaci infections thereby affecting different stages of the infection including inclusion growth and infectious progeny formation. Interestingly, the uptake of fluorescently labelled sphingolipids in bacteria inside the inclusion was accelerated in CERT-knockout cells indicating that C. psittaci can exploit CERT-independent sphingolipid uptake pathways. Moreover, the CERT-specific inhibitor HPA-12 strongly diminished sphingolipid transport to inclusions of infected CERT-knockout cells, suggesting that other HPA-12-sensitive factors are involved in sphingolipid trafficking to C. psittaci. Further analysis is required to decipher these interactions and to understand their contributions to bacterial development, host range, tissue tropism, and disease outcome.

28542388	To study the impact of epigenetic changes on biological functions, the ability to manipulate the epigenetic status of certain genomic regions artificially could be an indispensable technology. "Epigenome editing" techniques have gradually emerged that apply TALE or CRISPR/Cas9 technologies with various effector domains isolated from epigenetic code writers or erasers such as DNA methyltransferase, 5-methylcytosine oxidase, and histone modification enzymes. Here we demonstrate that a TALE recognizing a major satellite, consisting of a repeated sequence in pericentromeres, could be fused with the bacterial CpG methyltransferase, SssI. ChIP-qPCR assays demonstrated that the fusion protein TALMaj-SssI preferentially bound to major chromosomal satellites in cultured cell lines. Then, TALMaj-SssI was expressed in fertilized mouse oocytes with hypomethylated major satellites (10-20% CpG islands). Bisulfite sequencing revealed that the DNA methylation status was increased specifically in major satellites (50-60%), but not in minor satellites or other repeat elements, such as Intracisternal A-particle (IAP) or long interspersed nuclear elements-1 (Line1) when the expression level of TALMaj-SssI is optimized in the cell. At a microscopic level, distal ends of chromosomes at the first mitotic stage were dramatically highlighted by the mCherry-tagged methyl CpG binding domain of human MBD1 (mCherry-MBD-NLS). Moreover, targeted DNA methylation to major satellites did not interfere with kinetochore function during early embryonic cleavages. Co-injection of dCas9 fused with SssI and guide RNA (gRNA) recognizing major satellite sequences enabled increment of the DNA methylation in the satellites, but a few off-target effects were also observed in minor satellites and retrotransposons. Although CRISPR can be applied instead of the TALE system, technical improvements to reduce off-target effects are required. We have demonstrated a new method of introducing DNA methylation without the need of other binding partners using the CpG methyltransferase, SssI.

28540675	As masters of genome-wide regulation, miRNAs represent a key component in the complex architecture of cellular processes. Over the last decade, it has become increasingly apparent that miRNAs have many important roles in the development of disease and cancer. Recently, however, their role in viral and bacterial gene regulation as well as host gene regulation during disease progression has become a field of interest. Due to their small size, miRNAs are the ideal mechanism for bacteria and viruses that have limited room in their genomes, as a single miRNA can target up to ~30 genes. Currently, only a limited number of miRNA and miRNA-like RNAs have been found in bacteria and viruses, a number that is sure to increase rapidly in the future. The interactions of these small noncoding RNAs in such primitive species have wide-reaching effects, from increasing viral and bacterial proliferation, better responses to stress, increased virulence, to manipulation of host immune responses to provide a more ideal environment for these pathogens to thrive. Here, we explore those roles to obtain a better grasp of just how complicated disease truly is.	SE Cardin|GM Borchert
28534836	In the past decade, molecular surveys of viral diversity have revealed that viruses are the most diverse and abundant biological entities on Earth. In culture, however, most viral isolates that infect microbes are represented by a few variants isolated on type strains, limiting our ability to study how natural variation affects virus-host interactions in the laboratory. We screened a set of 137 hot spring samples for viruses that infect a geographically diverse panel of the hyperthemophilic crenarchaeon Sulfolobus islandicus. We isolated and characterized eight SIRVs (Sulfolobus islandicus rod-shaped viruses) from two different regions within Yellowstone National Park (USA). Comparative genomics revealed that all SIRV sequenced isolates share 30 core genes that represent 50-60% of the genome. The core genome phylogeny, as well as the distribution of variable genes (shared by some but not all SIRVs) and the signatures of host-virus interactions recorded on the CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) repeat-spacer arrays of S. islandicus hosts, identify different SIRV lineages, each associated with a different geographic location. Moreover, our studies reveal that SIRV core genes do not appear to be under diversifying selection and thus we predict that the abundant and diverse variable genes govern the coevolutionary arms race between SIRVs and their hosts.

28533324	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 engineering of the CYP3A5 *3 locus (rs776746) in human liver cell line HuH-7 (CYP3A5 *3/*3) has led to three CYP3A5 *1 cell lines by deletion of the exon 3B splice junction or point mutation. Cell lines CYP3A5 *1/*3 sd (single deletion), CYP3A5 *1/*1 dd (double deletion), or CYP3A5 *1/*3 pm (point mutation) expressed the CYP3A5 *1 mRNA and had elevated CYP3A5 mRNA (P < 0.0005 for all engineered cell lines) and protein expression compared with HuH-7. In metabolism assays, HuH-7 had less tacrolimus (all P < 0.05) or midazolam (MDZ) (all P < 0.005) disappearance than all engineered cell lines. HuH-7 had less 1-OH MDZ (all P < 0.0005) or 4-OH (all P < 0.005) production in metabolism assays than all bioengineered cell lines. We confirmed CYP3A5 metabolic activity with the CYP3A4 selective inhibitor CYP3CIDE. This is the first report of genomic CYP3A5 bioengineering in human cell lines with drug metabolism analysis.

28531104	Nineteen Vibrio anguillarum-specific temperate bacteriophages isolated across Europe and Chile from aquaculture and environmental sites were genome sequenced and analyzed for host range, morphology and life cycle characteristics. The phages were classified as Siphoviridae with genome sizes between 46,006 and 54,201 bp. All 19 phages showed high genetic similarity, and 13 phages were genetically identical. Apart from sporadically distributed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), genetic diversifications were located in three variable regions (VR1, VR2 and VR3) in six of the phage genomes. Identification of specific genes, such as N6-adenine methyltransferase and lambda like repressor, as well as the presence of a tRNAArg, suggested a both mutualistic and parasitic interaction between phages and hosts. During short term phage exposure experiments, 28% of a V. anguillarum host population was lysogenized by the temperate phages and a genomic analysis of a collection of 31 virulent V. anguillarum showed that the isolated phages were present as prophages in >50% of the strains covering large geographical distances. Further, phage sequences were widely distributed among CRISPR-Cas arrays of publicly available sequenced Vibrios. The observed distribution of these specific temperate Vibriophages across large geographical scales may be explained by efficient dispersal of phages and bacteria in the marine environment combined with a mutualistic interaction between temperate phages and their hosts which selects for co-existence rather than arms race dynamics.

28522548	We report a comprehensive toolkit that enables targeted, specific modification of monocot and dicot genomes using a variety of genome engineering approaches. Our reagents, based on transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 system, are systematized for fast, modular cloning and accommodate diverse regulatory sequences to drive reagent expression. Vectors are optimized to create either single or multiple gene knockouts and large chromosomal deletions. Moreover, integration of geminivirus-based vectors enables precise gene editing through homologous recombination. Regulation of transcription is also possible. A Web-based tool streamlines vector selection and construction. One advantage of our platform is the use of the Csy-type (CRISPR system yersinia) ribonuclease 4 (Csy4) and tRNA processing enzymes to simultaneously express multiple guide RNAs (gRNAs). For example, we demonstrate targeted deletions in up to six genes by expressing 12 gRNAs from a single transcript. Csy4 and tRNA expression systems are almost twice as effective in inducing mutations as gRNAs expressed from individual RNA polymerase III promoters. Mutagenesis can be further enhanced 2.5-fold by incorporating the Trex2 exonuclease. Finally, we demonstrate that Cas9 nickases induce gene targeting at frequencies comparable to native Cas9 when they are delivered on geminivirus replicons. The reagents have been successfully validated in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), Medicago truncatula, wheat (Triticum aestivum), and barley (Hordeum vulgare).

28522389	The understanding of the genetic mechanism of Staphylococcus aureus requires efficient tools, however, genetic manipulation in S. aureus is always laborious and time-consuming.

28522326	Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) represent an ideal in vitro platform to study human genetics and biology. The recent advent of programmable nucleases makes also the human genome amenable to experimental genetics through either the correction of mutations in patient-derived iPSC lines or the de novo introduction of mutations into otherwise healthy iPSCs. The production of specific and sometimes complex genotypes in multiple cell lines requires efficient and streamlined gene editing technologies. In this article we provide protocols for gene editing in hiPSCs. We presently achieve high rates of gene editing at up to three loci using a modified iCRISPR system. This system includes a doxycycline inducible Cas9 and sgRNA/reporter plasmids for the enrichment of transfected cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Here we cover the selection of target sites, vector construction, transfection, and isolation and genotyping of modified hiPSC clones.	S Yumlu|J Stumm|S Bashir|AK Dreyer|P Lisowski|E Danner|R Kühn
28522325	Recurrent chromosomal translocations often lead to expression of fusion proteins associated with oncogenic transformation. To study translocations and downstream events, genome editing techniques have been developed to generate chromosomal translocations through non-homologous end joining of DNA double-strand breaks introduced at the two participating endogenous loci. However, the frequencies at which these events occur is usually too low to efficiently clone cells carrying the translocation. This article provides a detailed method using CRISPR-Cas9 technology and homology-directed repair to efficiently isolate cells harboring a chromosomal translocation. For an additional level of control, the resulting fusion protein is conditionally expressed to allow early events in oncogenic transformation to be studied. We focus on the generation of the EWSR1-WT1 fusion using human mesenchymal cells, which is associated with the translocation found in desmoplastic small round cell tumors.	F Vanoli|M Jasin
28522157	The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) systems are RNA-guided sequence-specific prokaryotic antiviral immune systems. In prokaryotes, small RNA molecules guide Cas effector endonucleases to invading foreign genetic elements in a sequence-dependent manner, resulting in DNA cleavage by the endonuclease upon target binding. A rewired CRISPR/Cas9 system can be used for targeted and precise genome editing in eukaryotic cells. CRISPR/Cas has also been harnessed to target human pathogenic viruses as a potential new antiviral strategy. Here, we review recent CRISPR/Cas9-based approaches to combat specific human viruses in humans and discuss challenges that need to be overcome before CRISPR/Cas9 may be used in the clinic as an antiviral strategy.

28511927	Interferon-induced transmembrane protein (IFITM) 1, 2 and 3 genes encode a family of interferon (IFN)-induced transmembrane proteins that block entry of a broad spectrum of pathogens. However, the transcriptional regulation of these genes, especially whether there exist any enhancers and their roles during the IFN induction process remain elusive. Here, through public data mining, episomal luciferase reporter assay and in vivo CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, we identified an IFN-responsive enhancer located 35kb upstream of IFITM3 gene promoter upregulating the IFN-induced expression of IFITM1, 2 and 3 genes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) 1 bound to the enhancer with the treatment of IFN and was indispensable for the enhancer activity. Furthermore, using chromosome conformation capture technique, we revealed that the IFITM1, 2 and 3 genes physically clustered together and constitutively looped to the distal enhancer through long-range interactions in both HEK293 and A549 cells, providing structural basis for coordinated regulation of IFITM1, 2 and 3 by the enhancer. Finally, we showed that in vivo truncation of the enhancer impaired IFN-induced resistance to influenza A virus (IAV) infection. These findings expand our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the transcriptional regulation of IFITM1, 2 and 3 expression and its ability to mediate IFN signaling.

28511701	Conditional knockout mice and transgenic mice expressing recombinases, reporters, and inducible transcriptional activators are key for many genetic studies and comprise over 90% of mouse models created. Conditional knockout mice are generated using labor-intensive methods of homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells and are available for only ~25% of all mouse genes. Transgenic mice generated by random genomic insertion approaches pose problems of unreliable expression, and thus there is a need for targeted-insertion models. Although CRISPR-based strategies were reported to create conditional and targeted-insertion alleles via one-step delivery of targeting components directly to zygotes, these strategies are quite inefficient.	Here we describe Easi-CRISPR (Efficient additions with ssDNA inserts-CRISPR), a targeting strategy in which long single-stranded DNA donors are injected with pre-assembled crRNA + tracrRNA + Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (ctRNP) complexes into mouse zygotes. We show for over a dozen loci that Easi-CRISPR generates correctly targeted conditional and insertion alleles in 8.5-100% of the resulting live offspring.	Easi-CRISPR solves the major problem of animal genome engineering, namely the inefficiency of targeted DNA cassette insertion. The approach is robust, succeeding for all tested loci. It is versatile, generating both conditional and targeted insertion alleles. Finally, it is highly efficient, as treating an average of only 50 zygotes is sufficient to produce a correctly targeted allele in up to 100% of live offspring. Thus, Easi-CRISPR offers a comprehensive means of building large-scale Cre-LoxP animal resources.

28509419	Elucidating the spatiotemporal organization of the genome inside the nucleus is imperative to our understanding of the regulation of genes and non-coding sequences during development and environmental changes. Emerging techniques of chromatin imaging promise to bridge the long-standing gap between sequencing studies, which reveal genomic information, and imaging studies that provide spatial and temporal information of defined genomic regions. Here, we demonstrate such an imaging technique based on two orthologues of the bacterial clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR associated protein 9 (Cas9). By fusing eGFP/mRuby2 to catalytically inactive versions of Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus Cas9, we show robust visualization of telomere repeats in live leaf cells of Nicotiana benthamiana. By tracking the dynamics of telomeres visualized by CRISPR-dCas9, we reveal dynamic telomere movements of up to 2 μm over 30 min during interphase. Furthermore, we show that CRISPR-dCas9 can be combined with fluorescence-labelled proteins to visualize DNA-protein interactions in vivo. By simultaneously using two dCas9 orthologues, we pave the way for the imaging of multiple genomic loci in live plants cells. CRISPR imaging bears the potential to significantly improve our understanding of the dynamics of chromosomes in live plant cells.

28508063	Molecular mechanisms by which long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) molecules may influence cancerous condition are poorly understood. The aberrant expression of SPRIGHTLY lncRNA, encoded within the drosophila gene homolog Sprouty-4 intron, is correlated with a variety of cancers, including human melanomas. We demonstrate by SHAPE-seq and dChIRP that SPRIGHTLY RNA secondary structure has a core pseudoknotted domain. This lncRNA interacts with the intronic regions of six pre-mRNAs: SOX5, SMYD3, SND1, MEOX2, DCTN6, and RASAL2, all of which have cancer-related functions. Hemizygous knockout of SPRIGHTLY by CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas9 in melanoma cells significantly decreases SPRIGHTLY lncRNA levels, simultaneously decreases the levels of its interacting pre-mRNA molecules, and decreases anchorage-independent growth rate of cells and the rate of in vivo tumor growth in mouse xenografts. These results provide the first demonstration of an lncRNA's three-dimensional coordinating role in facilitating cancer-related gene expression in human melanomas.

28502081	Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) incurs significant yield losses from powdery mildew, a major fungal disease caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt). enhanced disease resistance1 (EDR1) plays a negative role in the defense response against powdery mildew in Arabidopsis thaliana; however, the edr1 mutant does not show constitutively activated defense responses. This makes EDR1 an ideal target for approaches using new genome-editing tools to improve resistance to powdery mildew. We cloned TaEDR1 from hexaploid wheat and found high similarity among the three homoeologs of EDR1. Knock-down of TaEDR1 by virus-induced gene silencing or RNA interference enhanced resistance to powdery mildew, indicating that TaEDR1 negatively regulates powdery mildew resistance in wheat. We used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to generate Taedr1 wheat plants by simultaneous modification of the three homoeologs of wheat EDR1. No off-target mutations were detected in the Taedr1 mutant plants. The Taedr1 plants were resistant to powdery mildew and did not show mildew-induced cell death. Our study represents the successful generation of a potentially valuable trait using genome-editing technology in wheat and provides germplasm for disease resistance breeding.

28501380	In this study, CRISPRi (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats interference) was used for the first time to regulate expression of exogenously supplied rfp gene as a proof-of-concept, and endogenous PEPC1 gene as a proof-of-function in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The efficiency of 94% and stability of 7 generations via CRISPRi mediated gene regulation in C. reinhardtii have been demonstrated by RFP. Gene PEPC1 encoding proteins are essential for controlling the carbon flux that enters the TCA cycle and plays a crucial role in carbon partitioning of substrates in competition with lipid synthesis. All CrPEPC1 down-regulated strains have lower chlorophyll color, but higher biomass concentration and lipid accumulation rate. The present results revealed that CRISPRi based transcriptional silencing was applicable in C. reinhardtii and expanded the way to improve the yield, titer and productivity of microalgae-based products.

28499832	The advent of programmable nucleases such as ZFNs, TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 has brought the power of genetic manipulation to widely used model systems. In mammalian cells, nuclease-mediated DNA double strand break is mainly repaired through the error-prone non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair pathway, eventually leading to accumulation of small deletions or insertions (indels) that can inactivate gene function. However, due to the variable size of the indels and the polyploid status of many cell lines (e.g., cancer-derived cells), obtaining a knockout usually requires lengthy screening and characterization procedures. Given the more precise type of modifications that can be introduced upon homology-directed repair (HDR), we have developed HDR-based gene-targeting strategies that greatly facilitate the process of knockout generation in cell lines. To generate reversible knockouts (R-KO), a selectable promoter-less STOP cassette is inserted in an intron, interrupting transcription. Loss-of-function can be validated by RT-qPCR and is removable, enabling subsequent restoration of gene function. A variant of the R-KO procedure can be used to introduce point mutations. To generate constitutive knockouts (C-KO), an exon is targeted, which makes use of HDR-based gene disruption together with NHEJ-induced indels on non-HDR targeted allele(s). Hence the C-KO procedure greatly facilitates simultaneous inactivation of multiple alleles. Overall these genome-editing tools offer superior precision and efficiency for functional genetic approaches. We provide detailed protocols guiding in the design of targeting vectors and in the analysis and validation of gene targeting experiments.

28499446	Shigellosis is the most common cause of gastrointestinal infections in developing countries. In China, the species most frequently responsible for shigellosis is Shigella flexneri. S. flexneri remains largely unexplored from a genomic standpoint and is still described using a vocabulary based on biochemical and serological properties. Moreover, increasing numbers of ESBL-producing Shigella strains have been isolated from clinical samples. Despite this, only a few cases of ESBL-producing Shigella have been described in China. Therefore, a better understanding of ESBL-producing Shigella from a genomic standpoint is required. In this study, a S. flexneri type 1a isolate SP1 harboring blaCTX-M-14, which was recovered from the patient with diarrhea, was subjected to whole genome sequencing.	The draft genome assembly of S. flexneri strain SP1 consisted of 4,592,345 bp with a G+C content of 50.46%. RAST analysis revealed the genome contained 4798 coding sequences (CDSs) and 100 RNA-encoding genes. We detected one incomplete prophage and six candidate CRISPR loci in the genome. In vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing demonstrated that strain SP1 is resistant to ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefazolin, ceftriaxone and trimethoprim. In silico analysis detected genes mediating resistance to aminoglycosides, β-lactams, phenicol, tetracycline, sulphonamides, and trimethoprim. The bla CTX-M-14 gene was located on an IncFII2 plasmid. A series of virulence factors were identified in the genome.	In this study, we report the whole genome sequence of a blaCTX-M-14-encoding S. flexneri strain SP1. Dozens of resistance determinants were detected in the genome and may be responsible for the multidrug-resistance of this strain, although further confirmation studies are warranted. Numerous virulence factors identified in the strain suggest that isolate SP1 is potential pathogenic. The availability of the genome sequence and comparative analysis with other S. flexneri strains provides the basis to further address the evolution of drug resistance mechanisms and pathogenicity in S. flexneri.

28494568	Genome editing is a cutting-edge technology that generates DNA double strand breaks at the specific genomic DNA sequence through nuclease recognition and cleavage, and then achieves insertion, replacement, or deletion of the target gene via endogenous DNA repair mechanisms, such as non-homologous end joining, homology directed repair, and homologous recombination. So far, more than 600 human hereditary eye diseases and systemic hereditary diseases with ocular phenotypes have been found. However, most of these diseases are of incompletely elucidated pathogenesis and without effective therapies. Genome editing technology can precisely target and alter the genomes of animals, establish animal models of the hereditary diseases, and elucidate the relationship between the target gene and the disease phenotype, thereby providing a powerful approach to studying the pathogenic mechanisms underlying the hereditary eye diseases. In addition, correction of gene mutations by the genome editing brings a new hope to gene therapy for the hereditary eye diseases. This review introduces the molecular characteristics of 4 major enzymes used in the genome editing, including homing endonucleases, zinc finger nucleases, transcription activator-like effector nucleases, and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/ CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9), and summarizes the current applications of this technology in investigating the pathogenic mechanisms underlying the hereditary eye diseases.

28490437	Genome-wide screens have discovered a large set of essential genes in the opportunistic human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae However, the functions of many essential genes are still unknown, hampering vaccine development and drug discovery. Based on results from transposon sequencing (Tn-seq), we refined the list of essential genes in S. pneumoniae serotype 2 strain D39. Next, we created a knockdown library targeting 348 potentially essential genes by CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) and show a growth phenotype for 254 of them (73%). Using high-content microscopy screening, we searched for essential genes of unknown function with clear phenotypes in cell morphology upon CRISPRi-based depletion. We show that SPD_1416 and SPD_1417 (renamed to MurT and GatD, respectively) are essential for peptidoglycan synthesis, and that SPD_1198 and SPD_1197 (renamed to TarP and TarQ, respectively) are responsible for the polymerization of teichoic acid (TA) precursors. This knowledge enabled us to reconstruct the unique pneumococcal TA biosynthetic pathway. CRISPRi was also employed to unravel the role of the essential Clp-proteolytic system in regulation of competence development, and we show that ClpX is the essential ATPase responsible for ClpP-dependent repression of competence. The CRISPRi library provides a valuable tool for characterization of pneumococcal genes and pathways and revealed several promising antibiotic targets.

28489428	Exciting new advances in genome engineering have unlocked the potential to radically alter the treatment of human disease. In this review, we discuss the application of single-molecule techniques to uncover the mechanisms behind two premier classes of genome editing proteins: transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated system (Cas). These technologies have facilitated a striking number of gene editing applications in a variety of organisms; however, we are only beginning to understand the molecular mechanisms governing the DNA editing properties of these systems. Here, we discuss the DNA search and recognition process for TALEs and Cas9 that have been revealed by recent single-molecule experiments.	L Cuculis|CM Schroeder
28487920	Phenotypic screening is a powerful approach to discover small molecules with desired effects on biological systems, which can then be developed into therapeutic drugs. The identification of the target and mechanism of action of compounds discovered in phenotypic screens remains a major challenge. This feature article describes the use of genetic tools to reveal drug targets and mechanisms in mammalian cells. Until recently, RNA interference was the method of choice for such studies. Here, we highlight very recent additions to the genetic toolkit in mammalian cells, including CRISPR, CRISPR interference, and CRISPR activation, and illustrate their usefulness for drug target identification.

28487442	Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 genome engineering has revolutionised biomedical science and we are standing on the cusp of medical transformation. The therapeutic potential of this technology is tremendous, however, its translation to the clinic will be challenging. In this article, we review recent progress using this genome editing technology and explore its potential uses in studying and treating diseases of the liver. We discuss the development of new research tools and animal models as well as potential clinical applications, strategies and challenges.	FP Pankowicz|KE Jarrett|WR Lagor|KD Bissig
28486105	An oncogenic role for CHD4, a NuRD component, is defined for initiating and supporting tumor suppressor gene (TSG) silencing in human colorectal cancer. CHD4 recruits repressive chromatin proteins to sites of DNA damage repair, including DNA methyltransferases where it imposes de novo DNA methylation. At TSGs, CHD4 retention helps maintain DNA hypermethylation-associated transcriptional silencing. CHD4 is recruited by the excision repair protein OGG1 for oxidative damage to interact with the damage-induced base 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), while ZMYND8 recruits it to double-strand breaks. CHD4 knockdown activates silenced TSGs, revealing their role for blunting colorectal cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and metastases. High CHD4 and 8-OHdG levels plus low expression of TSGs strongly correlates with early disease recurrence and decreased overall survival.

28481362	We describe a combinatorial CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screening platform for mapping genetic interactions in mammalian cells. We targeted 107 chromatin-regulation factors in human cells with pools of either single or double single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) to downregulate individual genes or gene pairs, respectively. Relative enrichment analysis of individual sgRNAs or sgRNA pairs allowed for quantitative characterization of genetic interactions, and comparison with protein-protein-interaction data revealed a functional map of chromatin regulation.

28478103	Beyond its predominant role in human and animal therapy, the CRISPR-Cas9 system has also become an essential tool for plant research and plant breeding. Agronomic applications rely on the mastery of gene inactivation and gene modification. However, if the knock-out of genes by non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ)-mediated repair of the targeted double-strand breaks (DSBs) induced by the CRISPR-Cas9 system is rather well mastered, the knock-in of genes by homology-driven repair or end-joining remains difficult to perform efficiently in higher plants. In this review, we describe the different approaches that can be tested to improve the efficiency of CRISPR-induced gene modification in plants, which include the use of optimal transformation and regeneration protocols, the design of appropriate guide RNAs and donor templates and the choice of nucleases and means of delivery. We also present what can be done to orient DNA repair pathways in the target cells, and we show how the moss Physcomitrella patens can be used as a model plant to better understand what DNA repair mechanisms are involved, and how this knowledge could eventually be used to define more performant strategies of CRISPR-induced gene knock-in.

28475872	CRISPR adaptive immunity pathways protect prokaryotic cells against foreign nucleic acids using CRISPR RNA (crRNA)-guided nucleases. In type VI-A CRISPR-Cas systems, the signature protein Cas13a (formerly C2c2) contains two separate ribonuclease activities that catalyze crRNA maturation and ssRNA degradation. The Cas13a protein family occurs across different bacterial phyla and varies widely in both protein sequence and corresponding crRNA sequence conservation. Although grouped phylogenetically together, we show that the Cas13a enzyme family comprises two distinct functional groups that recognize orthogonal sets of crRNAs and possess different ssRNA cleavage specificities. These functional distinctions could not be bioinformatically predicted, suggesting more subtle co-evolution of Cas13a enzymes. Additionally, we find that Cas13a pre-crRNA processing is not essential for ssRNA cleavage, although it enhances ssRNA targeting for crRNAs encoded internally within the CRISPR array. We define two Cas13a protein subfamilies that can operate in parallel for RNA detection both in bacteria and for diagnostic applications.	A East-Seletsky|MR O'Connell|D Burstein|GJ Knott|JA Doudna
28475715	Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is the most common form of inherited retinal dystrophy. We recently identified mutations in REEP6, which encodes the receptor expression enhancing protein 6, in several families with autosomal recessive RP. REEP6 is related to the REEP and Yop1p family of ER shaping proteins and potential receptor accessory proteins, but the role of REEP6 in the retina is unknown. Here we characterize the disease mechanisms associated with loss of REEP6 function using a Reep6 knockout mouse generated by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. In control mice REEP6 was localized to the inner segment and outer plexiform layer of rod photoreceptors. The Reep6-/- mice exhibited progressive photoreceptor degeneration from P20 onwards. Ultrastructural analyses at P20 by transmission electron microscopy and 3View serial block face scanning EM revealed an expansion of the distal ER in the Reep6-/- rods and an increase in their number of mitochondria. Electroretinograms revealed photoreceptor dysfunction preceded degeneration, suggesting potential defects in phototransduction. There was no effect on the traffic of rhodopsin, Rom1 or peripherin/rds; however, the retinal guanylate cyclases GC1 and GC2 were severely affected in the Reep6 knockout animals, with almost undetectable expression. These changes correlated with an increase in C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) expression and the activation of caspase 12, suggesting that ER stress contributes to cell death. Collectively, these data suggest that REEP6 plays an essential role in maintaining cGMP homeostasis though facilitating the stability and/or trafficking of guanylate cyclases and maintaining ER and mitochondrial homeostasis.

28475701	The present study aimed to investigate the role of the αA-crystallin gene in inducing congenital cataracts in rabbits and to construct a novel animal model for characterization and pathologic analysis of congenital cataracts for future research.	We generated αA-crystallin gene knockout rabbits with congenital cataracts by coinjection of Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA into zygotes. Cataract phenotypes were investigated in a repeated study of 19 F0-generation and 11 F1-generation rabbits with αA-crystallin gene mutations. Heritability was analyzed by PCR, sequencing, slim lamp, hematoxylin eosin staining, immunohistochemistry, and Western blot.	We found αA-crystallin gene mutations in all 19 F0-generation pups (100%) with indel mutations in the αA-crystallin gene ranging from 3 to 52 bp. Off-target assay revealed that none of the potential off-target sites exhibited mutations, demonstrating that off-target mutagenesis was not induced by cytoplasmic microinjection of in vitro-transcribed Cas9 mRNA. Slim lamp assay revealed that 15 of 19 live pups (78.9%) exhibited typical phenotypes, including congenital cataracts, microphthalmia, obscurity, and early atrophy of the lens, and failed differentiation of lens fibers. Histologic hematoxylin and eosin staining showed that αA-crystallin gene knockout rabbits exhibited smaller lenses. Production of the αA-crystallin protein was determined to be dramatically reduced in αA-crystallin gene knockout rabbits. We induced αA-crystallin gene mutations and phenotypes in F1-generation rabbits.	Our data suggest that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutation of the αA-crystallin gene in rabbits recapitulates phenotypes of congenital cataracts, microphthalmia, obscurity, and early atrophy of the lens, and failed differentiation of lens fibers. These findings suggest the possibility of a new animal model of congenital cataracts, which should be used to further investigate the association between mutations in αA-crystallin gene and congenital cataracts in humans.

28474669	CRISPR-Cas9 screens are powerful tools for high-throughput interrogation of genome function, but can be confounded by nuclease-induced toxicity at both on- and off-target sites, likely due to DNA damage. Here, to test potential solutions to this issue, we design and analyse a CRISPR-Cas9 library with 10 variable-length guides per gene and thousands of negative controls targeting non-functional, non-genic regions (termed safe-targeting guides), in addition to non-targeting controls. We find this library has excellent performance in identifying genes affecting growth and sensitivity to the ricin toxin. The safe-targeting guides allow for proper control of toxicity from on-target DNA damage. Using this toxicity as a proxy to measure off-target cutting, we demonstrate with tens of thousands of guides both the nucleotide position-dependent sensitivity to single mismatches and the reduction of off-target cutting using truncated guides. Our results demonstrate a simple strategy for high-throughput evaluation of target specificity and nuclease toxicity in Cas9 screens.

28473627	The ease and applicability of CRISPR/Cas9--a new and precise gene editing and reproductive technology--have garnered hype and heightened concern about its potential 'unprecedented and horrific consequences' and have led many scientific leaders to call for a moratorium on its research and use. CRISPR appears distinctly more controversial than previous technological innovations (genetic or otherwise), with a greater reach and speed of human treatment and enhancement; however, we have seen similarly inflated hopes and fears in response to other medical innovations for well over a century. One intervention that has both historically and recently incited alarm--vaccines--serves as a pertinent example of what could go wrong if a technology's reach is shortened due to inflated fears. By comparing the vaccine controversy and the CRISPR debate, we can help separate the hype from the realistic potential of these technologies. How our society grapples with such innovations will determine the extent to which their impact on our individual and collective health will be beneficial. We must recognise the need for a tempered approach to CRISPR conversation leading to regulation and ethical application. Although CRISPR's reach will continue expanding with ongoing research, thus requiring continuous evaluation, the lessons we have learned from the vaccine controversy demonstrate that our approach must not be to shut down regulation and application now, but to thoughtfully conjoin productive debate and action so that therapeutic gene editing can alleviate suffering as soon as possible without precipitating social outcomes we would belatedly deplore.

28469274	Corynebacterium glutamicum is an important industrial metabolite producer that is difficult to genetically engineer. Although the Streptococcus pyogenes (Sp) CRISPR-Cas9 system has been adapted for genome editing of multiple bacteria, it cannot be introduced into C. glutamicum. Here we report a Francisella novicida (Fn) CRISPR-Cpf1-based genome-editing method for C. glutamicum. CRISPR-Cpf1, combined with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) recombineering, precisely introduces small changes into the bacterial genome at efficiencies of 86-100%. Large gene deletions and insertions are also obtained using an all-in-one plasmid consisting of FnCpf1, CRISPR RNA, and homologous arms. The two CRISPR-Cpf1-assisted systems enable N iterative rounds of genome editing in 3N+4 or 3N+2 days. A proof-of-concept, codon saturation mutagenesis at G149 of γ-glutamyl kinase relieves L-proline inhibition using Cpf1-assisted ssDNA recombineering. Thus, CRISPR-Cpf1-based genome editing provides a highly efficient tool for genetic engineering of Corynebacterium and other bacteria that cannot utilize the Sp CRISPR-Cas9 system.

28469255	Genome-scale engineering is indispensable in understanding and engineering microorganisms, but the current tools are mainly limited to bacterial systems. Here we report an automated platform for multiplex genome-scale engineering in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, an important eukaryotic model and widely used microbial cell factory. Standardized genetic parts encoding overexpression and knockdown mutations of >90% yeast genes are created in a single step from a full-length cDNA library. With the aid of CRISPR-Cas, these genetic parts are iteratively integrated into the repetitive genomic sequences in a modular manner using robotic automation. This system allows functional mapping and multiplex optimization on a genome scale for diverse phenotypes including cellulase expression, isobutanol production, glycerol utilization and acetic acid tolerance, and may greatly accelerate future genome-scale engineering endeavours in yeast.

28462950	T-cell activation RhoGTPase-activating protein (TAGAP) is a GTPase-activating protein specific for RhoA that is exclusively expressed in activated T cells. Genome-wide association studies and metagenome SNPs analyses have indicated that TAGAP is associated with the pathogenesis of multiple autoimmune diseases, including psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, celiac disease and multiple sclerosis. However, the precise function of TAGAP remains unclear. Because TH17 cells contribute to TAGAP-associated autoimmune diseases, we hypothesized that TAGAP plays key roles in the differentiation and/or function of TH17 cells. To evaluate this hypothesis, we analyzed the effect of TAGAP on TH17 differentiation in vitro and established a line of TAGAP-deficient mice. We found that TAGAP was required for TH17 differentiation in vitro and that the loss of TAGAP in mice ameliorated the clinical features of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, indicating that TAGAP is critical for disease progression. We also demonstrated that TAGAP interacts with RhoH, an adapter protein that interacts with lck and ZAP70 in proximal TCR signaling. TAGAP competes with ZAP70 for RhoH binding, thereby inhibiting TCR-associated signal transduction. Consistent with these findings, TCR-induced ERK activation was increased in TAGAP-deficient T cells. Because the upregulation of TCR signaling inhibits Th17 differentiation, TAGAP may prevent TCR signaling activity from reaching the limit of the induction of TH17 cells. Collectively, our findings indicate that TAGAP is a novel factor required for TH17-cell differentiation and that TAGAP potentially represents a novel target of autoimmune disease therapies.

28460414	The CRISPR or clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats system is currently the most advanced approach to genome editing and is notable for providing an unprecedented degree of specificity, effectiveness, and versatility in genetic manipulation. CRISPR evolved as a prokaryotic immune system to provide an acquired immunity and resistance to foreign genetic elements such as bacteriophages. It has recently been developed into a tool for the specific targeting of nucleotide sequences within complex eukaryotic genomes for the purpose of genetic manipulation. The power of CRISPR lies in its simplicity and ease of use, its flexibility to be targeted to any given nucleotide sequence by the choice of an easily synthesized guide RNA, and its ready ability to continue to undergo technical improvements. Applications for CRISPR are numerous including creation of novel transgenic cell animals for research, high-throughput screening of gene function, potential clinical gene therapy, and nongene-editing approaches such as modulating gene activity and fluorescent tagging. In this prospect article, we will describe the salient features of the CRISPR system with an emphasis on important drawbacks and considerations with respect to eliminating off-target events and obtaining efficient CRISPR delivery. We will discuss recent technical developments to the system and we will illustrate some of the most recent applications with an emphasis on approaches to eliminate human viruses including HIV-1, JCV and HSV-1 and prospects for the future.

28459459	RNA-guided CRISPR-Cas9 endonucleases are widely used for genome engineering, but our understanding of Cas9 specificity remains incomplete. Here, we developed a biochemical method (SITE-Seq), using Cas9 programmed with single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs), to identify the sequence of cut sites within genomic DNA. Cells edited with the same Cas9-sgRNA complexes are then assayed for mutations at each cut site using amplicon sequencing. We used SITE-Seq to examine Cas9 specificity with sgRNAs targeting the human genome. The number of sites identified depended on sgRNA sequence and nuclease concentration. Sites identified at lower concentrations showed a higher propensity for off-target mutations in cells. The list of off-target sites showing activity in cells was influenced by sgRNP delivery, cell type and duration of exposure to the nuclease. Collectively, our results underscore the utility of combining comprehensive biochemical identification of off-target sites with independent cell-based measurements of activity at those sites when assessing nuclease activity and specificity.

28459458	Sensitive detection of off-target effects is important for translating CRISPR-Cas9 nucleases into human therapeutics. In vitro biochemical methods for finding off-targets offer the potential advantages of greater reproducibility and scalability while avoiding limitations associated with strategies that require the culture and manipulation of living cells. Here we describe circularization for in vitro reporting of cleavage effects by sequencing (CIRCLE-seq), a highly sensitive, sequencing-efficient in vitro screening strategy that outperforms existing cell-based or biochemical approaches for identifying CRISPR-Cas9 genome-wide off-target mutations. In contrast to previously described in vitro methods, we show that CIRCLE-seq can be practiced using widely accessible next-generation sequencing technology and does not require reference genome sequences. Importantly, CIRCLE-seq can be used to identify off-target mutations associated with cell-type-specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms, demonstrating the feasibility and importance of generating personalized specificity profiles. CIRCLE-seq provides an accessible, rapid, and comprehensive method for identifying genome-wide off-target mutations of CRISPR-Cas9.	SQ Tsai|NT Nguyen|J Malagon-Lopez|VV Topkar|MJ Aryee|JK Joung
28459452	Specifically targeting genomic rearrangements and mutations in tumor cells remains an elusive goal in cancer therapy. Here, we used Cas9-based genome editing to introduce the gene encoding the prodrug-converting enzyme herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase (HSV1-tk) into the genomes of cancer cells carrying unique sequences resulting from genome rearrangements. Specifically, we targeted the breakpoints of TMEM135-CCDC67 and MAN2A1-FER fusions in human prostate cancer or hepatocellular carcinoma cells in vitro and in mouse xenografts. We designed one adenovirus to deliver the nickase Cas9D10A and guide RNAs targeting the breakpoint sequences, and another to deliver an EGFP-HSV1-tk construct flanked by sequences homologous to those surrounding the breakpoint. Infection with both viruses resulted in breakpoint-dependent expression of EGFP-tk and ganciclovir-mediated apoptosis. When mouse xenografts were treated with adenoviruses and ganciclovir, all animals showed decreased tumor burden and no mortality during the study. Thus, Cas9-mediated suicide-gene insertion may be a viable genotype-specific cancer therapy.	ZH Chen|YP Yu|ZH Zuo|JB Nelson|GK Michalopoulos|S Monga|S Liu|G Tseng|JH Luo
28459450	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of death in the developed world, yet facile preclinical models that mimic the natural stages of CRC progression are lacking. Through the orthotopic engraftment of colon organoids we describe a broadly usable immunocompetent CRC model that recapitulates the entire adenoma-adenocarcinoma-metastasis axis in vivo. The engraftment procedure takes less than 5 minutes, shows efficient tumor engraftment in two-thirds of mice, and can be achieved using organoids derived from genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs), wild-type organoids engineered ex vivo, or from patient-derived human CRC organoids. In this model, we describe the genotype and time-dependent progression of CRCs from adenocarcinoma (6 weeks), to local disseminated disease (11-12 weeks), and spontaneous metastasis (>20 weeks). Further, we use the system to show that loss of dysregulated Wnt signaling is critical for the progression of disseminated CRCs. Thus, our approach provides a fast and flexible means to produce tailored CRC mouse models for genetic studies and pre-clinical investigation.

28459449	In vivo interrogation of the function of genes implicated in tumorigenesis is limited by the need to generate and cross germline mutant mice. Here we describe approaches to model colorectal cancer (CRC) and metastasis, which rely on in situ gene editing and orthotopic organoid transplantation in mice without cancer-predisposing mutations. Autochthonous tumor formation is induced by CRISPR-Cas9-based editing of the Apc and Trp53 tumor suppressor genes in colon epithelial cells and by orthotopic transplantation of Apc-edited colon organoids. ApcΔ/Δ;KrasG12D/+;Trp53Δ/Δ (AKP) mouse colon organoids and human CRC organoids engraft in the distal colon and metastasize to the liver. Finally, we apply the orthotopic transplantation model to characterize the clonal dynamics of Lgr5+ stem cells and demonstrate sequential activation of an oncogene in established colon adenomas. These experimental systems enable rapid in vivo characterization of cancer-associated genes and reproduce the entire spectrum of tumor progression and metastasis.

28456574	Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infects more than 90% of the world's adult population. Once established, latent infection of nasopharyngeal epithelial cells with EBV is difficult to eradicate and might lead to the development of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in a small subset of individuals. In this study we explored the anti-EBV potential of CRISPR/Cas9 targeting of EBV genome in infected NPC cells. We designed gRNAs to target different regions of the EBV genome and transfected them into C666-1 cells. The levels of EBV DNA in transfected cells were decreased by about 50%. The suppressive effect on EBV DNA load lasted for weeks but could not be further enhanced by re-transfection of gRNA. Suppression of EBV by CRISPR/Cas9 did not affect survival of C666-1 cells but sensitized them to chemotherapeutic killing by cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil. Our work provides the proof-of-principle for suppressing EBV DNA load with CRISPR/Cas9 and a potential new strategy to sensitize EBV-infected NPC cells to chemotherapy.

28448034	The development of programmable genome-editing tools has facilitated the use of reverse genetics to understand the roles specific genomic sequences play in the functioning of cells and whole organisms. This cause has been tremendously aided by the recent introduction of the CRISPR/Cas9 system-a versatile tool that allows researchers to manipulate the genome and transcriptome in order to, among other things, knock out, knock down, or knock in genes in a targeted manner. For the purpose of knocking out a gene, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated double-strand breaks recruit the non-homologous end-joining DNA repair pathway to introduce the frameshift-causing insertion or deletion of nucleotides at the break site. However, an individual guide RNA may cause undesirable off-target effects, and to rule these out, the use of multiple guide RNAs is necessary. This multiplicity of targets also means that a high-volume screening of clones is required, which in turn begs the use of an efficient high-throughput technique to genotype the knockout clones. Current genotyping techniques either suffer from inherent limitations or incur high cost, hence rendering them unsuitable for high-throughput purposes. Here, we detail the protocol for using fluorescent PCR, which uses genomic DNA from crude cell lysate as a template, and then resolving the PCR fragments via capillary gel electrophoresis. This technique is accurate enough to differentiate one base-pair difference between fragments and hence is adequate in indicating the presence or absence of a frameshift in the coding sequence of the targeted gene. This precise knowledge effectively precludes the need for a confirmatory sequencing step and allows users to save time and cost in the process. Moreover, this technique has proven to be versatile in genotyping various mammalian cells of various tissue origins targeted by guide RNAs against numerous genes, as shown here and elsewhere.

28446605	Several groups have used genome-wide libraries of lentiviruses encoding small guide RNAs (sgRNAs) for genetic screens. In most cases, sgRNA expression cassettes are integrated into cells by using lentiviruses, and target genes are statistically estimated by the readout of sgRNA sequences after targeted sequencing. We present a new virus-free method for human gene knockout screens using a genome-wide library of CRISPR/Cas9 sgRNAs based on plasmids and target gene identification via whole-genome sequencing (WGS) confirmation of authentic mutations rather than statistical estimation through targeted amplicon sequencing. We used 30,840 pairs of individually synthesized oligonucleotides to construct the genome-scale sgRNA library, collectively targeting 10,280 human genes (i.e. three sgRNAs per gene). These plasmid libraries were co-transfected with a Cas9-expression plasmid into human cells, which were then treated with cytotoxic drugs or viruses. Only cells lacking key factors essential for cytotoxic drug metabolism or viral infection were able to survive. Genomic DNA isolated from cells that survived these challenges was subjected to WGS to directly identify CRISPR/Cas9-mediated causal mutations essential for cell survival. With this approach, we were able to identify known and novel genes essential for viral infection in human cells. We propose that genome-wide sgRNA screens based on plasmids coupled with WGS are powerful tools for forward genetics studies and drug target discovery.

28445761	The cortical actin cytoskeleton has been shown to be critical for the reorganization and heterogeneity of plasma membrane components of many cells, including T cells. Building on previous studies at the T cell immunological synapse, we quantitatively assess the structure and dynamics of this meshwork using live-cell superresolution fluorescence microscopy and spatio-temporal image correlation spectroscopy. We show for the first time, to our knowledge, that not only does the dense actin cortex flow in a retrograde fashion toward the synapse center, but the plasma membrane itself shows similar behavior. Furthermore, using two-color, live-cell superresolution cross-correlation spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the two flows are correlated and, in addition, we show that coupling may extend to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane by examining the flow of GPI-anchored proteins. Finally, we demonstrate that the actin flow is correlated with a third component, α-actinin, which upon CRISPR knockout led to reduced plasma membrane flow directionality despite increased actin flow velocity. We hypothesize that this apparent cytoskeletal-membrane coupling could provide a mechanism for driving the observed retrograde flow of signaling molecules such as the TCR, Lck, ZAP70, LAT, and SLP76.

28445729	Formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) initiates extrinsic apoptosis. Caspase-8 and its regulator cFLIP control death signaling by binding to death-receptor-bound FADD. By elucidating the function of the caspase-8 homolog, caspase-10, we discover that caspase-10 negatively regulates caspase-8-mediated cell death. Significantly, we reveal that caspase-10 reduces DISC association and activation of caspase-8. Furthermore, we extend our co-operative/hierarchical binding model of caspase-8/cFLIP and show that caspase-10 does not compete with caspase-8 for binding to FADD. Utilizing caspase-8-knockout cells, we demonstrate that caspase-8 is required upstream of both cFLIP and caspase-10 and that DISC formation critically depends on the scaffold function of caspase-8. We establish that caspase-10 rewires DISC signaling to NF-κB activation/cell survival and demonstrate that the catalytic activity of caspase-10, and caspase-8, is redundant in gene induction. Thus, our data are consistent with a model in which both caspase-10 and cFLIP coordinately regulate CD95L-mediated signaling for death or survival.

28444368	The ability to transform Camelina sativa easily with biosynthetic enzymes derived from other plants has made this oil seed crop an ideal platform for the production of unusual lipids valuable for different applications. However, in addition to expressing transgenic enzymes, the suppression of endogenous enzyme activity to reduce competition for common substrates or cofactors is also required to enhance the production of target compounds. As camelina possesses a relatively undifferentiated hexaploid genome, up to three gene homeologs can code for any particular enzymatic activity, complicating efforts to alter endogenous biosynthetic pathways. New genome editing technologies, such as that offered by the CRISPR/Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein) system, offer the capability to introduce mutations into specifically targeted genomic sites. Here, by using a carefully designed guide RNA identical to all three homeologs, we demonstrate the ability of the CRISPR/Cas genome editing system to introduce mutations in all three CsDGAT1 or CsPDAT1 homeologous genes important for triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis in developing seeds. Sequence analysis from transgenic T1 plants revealed that each CsDGAT1 or each CsPDAT1 homeolog was altered by multiple mutations, resulting in a genetic mosaic in the plants. Interestingly, seed harvested from both CsDGAT1- and CsPDAT1-targeted lines was often shrunken and wrinkled. Further, lipid analysis revealed that many lines produced seed with reduced oil content and altered fatty acid composition, consistent with the role of the targeted genes in seed oil biosynthesis. The CRISPR/Cas system therefore represents a useful method to alter endogenous biosynthetic pathways efficiently in polyploid species such as camelina.	JA Aznar-Moreno|TP Durrett
28441427	The CRISPR-Cas systems provide invader defense in a wide variety of prokaryotes, as well as technologies for many powerful applications. The Type III-A or Csm CRISPR-Cas system is one of the most widely distributed across prokaryotic phyla, and cleaves targeted DNA and RNA molecules. In this work, we have constructed modules of Csm systems from 3 bacterial species and heterologously expressed the functional modules in E. coli. The modules include a Cas6 protein and a CRISPR locus for crRNA production, and Csm effector complex proteins. The expressed modules from L. lactis, S. epidermidis and S. thermophilus specifically eliminate invading plasmids recognized by the crRNAs of the systems. Characteristically, activation of plasmid targeting activity depends on transcription of the plasmid sequence recognized by the crRNA. Activity was not observed when transcription of the crRNA target sequence was blocked, or when the opposite strand or a non-target sequence was transcribed. Moreover, the Csm module can be programmed to recognize plasmids with novel target sequences by addition of appropriate crRNA coding sequences to the module. These systems provide a platform for investigation of Type III-A CRISPR-Cas systems in E. coli, and for introduction of programmable transcription-activated DNA targeting into novel organisms.

28440027	The CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system was originally derived from the prokaryotic adaptive immune system mediated by Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated proteins (Cas). The system has been successfully applied to genome editing in eukaryotes and has contributed to remarkable advances in the life sciences, in areas ranging from agriculture to genetic disease therapies. For efficient editing and extending the influence of this system, proper delivery of its components is crucial. Both viral and nonviral delivery methods are reviewed here, along with the advantages and disadvantages of each. In addition, we review ex vivo and in vivo CRISPR/Cas9 applications for disease therapies. Related remarkable studies are highlighted and relevant startup companies and their drug development pipelines are described. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

28439853	The recent emergence of the CRISPR/Cas system has boosted the possibilities for precise genome engineering approaches throughout all kingdoms of life. The most common application for plants is targeted mutagenesis, whereby a Cas9-mediated DNA double-strand break (DSB) is repaired by mutagenic nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). However, the site-specific alteration of a genomic sequence or integration of a transgene relies on the precise repair by homologous recombination (HR) using a suitable donor sequence: this poses a particular challenge in plants, as NHEJ is the preferred repair mechanism for DSBs in somatic tissue. Here, we describe our recently developed in planta gene targeting (ipGT) system, which works via the induction of DSBs by Cas9 to activate the target and the targeting vector at the same time, making it independent of high transformation efficiencies.

28439828	Post-transcriptional silencing by microRNAs (miRNAs) is a critical constituent of eukaryotic gene regulation. miRNAs are short (~22nt) noncoding RNAs capable of specifically targeting the miRNA-induced-silencing-complex (miRISC) to transcripts bearing a complementary miRNA response element (MRE). Although recent methodological advances have greatly improved our understanding of miRNA biogenesis and the mechanisms by which miRNAs repress their cognate targets, exploring the physiological relevance of direct miRNA-target interactions in vivo has remained an outstanding challenge. Here we describe the experimental protocol underlying a novel approach, which allows direct interrogation of specific miRNA-MRE interactions by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome engineering. In this instance, the CRISPR/Cas9 system is first used to catalyze homology-directed replacement of candidate MREs with molecular barcodes at endogenous loci. Subsequently, the effect of MRE mutation on transcript abundance (i.e., MRE activity) can be rapidly evaluated by routine quantitative PCR. This strategy enables functional investigation of a putative miRNA-target pair in a pool of transiently transfected cells, obviating the need for generation of clonal cell lines or transgenic animals. This protocol can be implemented in any cell line in less than 2 weeks, and can readily be scaled up for multiplex studies. To facilitate the conceptual workflow underlying this strategy, we also describe a genome-wide resource for automated design and computational evaluation of CRISPR/Cas9 guide RNAs targeting all predicted MREs in various species (miR-CRISPR).

28434148	The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) system, an RNA-guided DNA targeting technology, is triggering a revolution in the field of biology. CRISPR/Cas9 has demonstrated great potential for genetic manipulation. In this review, we discuss the current development of CRISPR/Cas9 technologies for therapeutic applications, especially chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell-based adoptive immunotherapy. Different methods used to facilitate efficient CRISPR delivery and gene editing in T cells are compared. The potential of genetic manipulation using CRISPR/Cas9 system to generate universal CAR T cells and potent T cells that are resistant to exhaustion and inhibition is explored. We also address the safety concerns associated with the use of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing and provide potential solutions and future directions of CRISPR application in the field of CAR T cell immunotherapy. As an integration-free gene insertion method, CRISPR/Cas9 holds great promise as an efficient gene knock-in platform. Given the tremendous progress that has been made in the past few years, we believe that the CRISPR/Cas9 technology holds immense promise for advancing immunotherapy.	J Ren|Y Zhao
28432350	Next generation sequencing is becoming the method of choice for functional genomic studies that use pooled shRNA or CRISPR libraries. A key challenge in sequencing these mixed-oligo libraries is that they are highly susceptible to hairpin and/or heteroduplex formation. This results in polyclonal, low quality, and incomplete reads and reduces sequencing throughput. Unfortunately, this challenge is significantly magnified in low-to-medium throughput bench-top sequencers as failed reads significantly perturb the maximization of sequence coverage and multiplexing capabilities. Here, we report a methodology that can be adapted to maximize the coverage on a bench-top, Ion PGM System for smaller shRNA libraries with high efficiency. This ligation-based, half-shRNA sequencing strategy minimizes failed sequences and is also equally amenable to high-throughput sequencers for increased multiplexing. Towards this, we also demonstrate that our strategy to reduce heteroduplex formation improves multiplexing capabilities of pooled CRISPR screens using Illumina NextSeq 500. Overall, our method will facilitate sequencing of pooled shRNA or CRISPR libraries from genomic DNA and maximize sequence coverage.

28431230	The CRISPR-associated protein Cas12a (Cpf1), which has been repurposed for genome editing, possesses two distinct nuclease activities: endoribonuclease activity for processing its own guide RNAs and RNA-guided DNase activity for target DNA cleavage. To elucidate the molecular basis of both activities, we determined crystal structures of Francisella novicida Cas12a bound to guide RNA and in complex with an R-loop formed by a non-cleavable guide RNA precursor and a full-length target DNA. Corroborated by biochemical experiments, these structures reveal the mechanisms of guide RNA processing and pre-ordering of the seed sequence in the guide RNA that primes Cas12a for target DNA binding. Furthermore, the R-loop complex structure reveals the strand displacement mechanism that facilitates guide-target hybridization and suggests a mechanism for double-stranded DNA cleavage involving a single active site. Together, these insights advance our mechanistic understanding of Cas12a enzymes and may contribute to further development of genome editing technologies.	DC Swarts|J van der Oost|M Jinek

28427715	Visualization of chromosome dynamics allows the investigation of spatiotemporal chromatin organization and its role in gene regulation and other cellular processes. However, current approaches to label multiple genomic loci in live cells have a fundamental limitation in the number of loci that can be labeled and uniquely identified. Here we describe an approach we call "track first and identify later" for multiplexed visualization of chromosome dynamics by combining two techniques: CRISPR imaging and DNA sequential fluorescence in situ hybridization. Our approach first labels and tracks chromosomal loci in live cells with the CRISPR-Cas9 system, then barcodes those loci by DNA sequential fluorescence in situ hybridization in fixed cells and resolves their identities. We demonstrate our approach by tracking telomere dynamics, identifying 12 unique subtelomeric regions with variable detection efficiencies, and tracking back the telomere dynamics of respective chromosomes in mouse embryonic stem cells.

28426329	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR), linked with CRISPR associated (Cas) genes, can confer adaptive immunity to bacteria, against bacteriophage infections. Thus from a therapeutic standpoint, CRISPR immunity increases biofilm resistance to phage therapy. Recently, however, CRISPR-Cas genes have been implicated in reducing biofilm formation in lysogenized cells. Thus CRISPR immunity can have complex effects on phage-host-lysogen interactions, particularly in a biofilm. In this contribution, we develop and analyse a series of dynamical systems to elucidate and disentangle these interactions. Two competition models are used to study the effects of lysogens (first model) and CRISPR-immune bacteria (second model) in the biofilm. In the third model, the effect of delivering lysogens to a CRISPR-immune biofilm is investigated. Using standard analyses of equilibria, stability and bifurcations, our models predict that lysogens may be able to displace CRISPR-immune bacteria in a biofilm, and thus suggest strategies to eliminate phage-resistant biofilms.

28420884	Viruses depend on their hosts to complete their replication cycles; they exploit cellular receptors for entry and hijack cellular functions to replicate their genome, assemble progeny virions and spread. Recently, genome-scale CRISPR-Cas screens have been used to identify host factors that are required for virus replication, including the replication of clinically relevant viruses such as Zika virus, West Nile virus, dengue virus and hepatitis C virus. In this Review, we discuss the technical aspects of genome-scale knockout screens using CRISPR-Cas technology, and we compare these screens with alternative genetic screening technologies. The relative ease of use and reproducibility of CRISPR-Cas make it a powerful tool for probing virus-host interactions and for identifying new antiviral targets.

28418635	Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are an important host for biopharmaceutical production. Generation of stable CHO cells typically requires cointegration of dhfr and a foreign gene into chromosomes and subsequent methotrexate (MTX) selection for coamplification of dhfr and foreign gene. CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) is an emerging system that effectively suppresses gene transcription through the coordination of dCas9 protein and guide RNA (gRNA). However, CRISPRi has yet to be exploited in CHO cells. Here we constructed vectors expressing the functional CRISPRi system and proved effective CRISPRi-mediated suppression of dhfr transcription in CHO cells. We next generated stable CHO cell clones coexpressing DHFR, the model protein (EGFP), dCas9 and gRNA targeting dhfr. Combined with MTX selection, CRISPRi-mediated repression of dhfr imparted extra selective pressure to force CHO cells to coamplify more copies of dhfr and egfp genes. Compared with the traditional method relying on MTX selection (up to 250 nM), the CRISPRi approach increased the dhfr copy number ∼3-fold, egfp copy number ∼3.6-fold and enhanced the EGFP expression ∼3.8-fold, without impeding the cell growth. Furthermore, we exploited the CRISPRi approach to enhance the productivity of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) ∼2.3-fold. Our data demonstrate, for the first time, the application of CRISPRi in CHO cells to enhance recombinant protein production and may pave a new avenue to CHO cell engineering.

28416114	It is generally assumed that the allocation and synthesis of total cellular resources in microorganisms are uniquely determined by the growth conditions. Adaptation to a new physiological state leads to a change in cell size via reallocation of cellular resources. However, it has not been understood how cell size is coordinated with biosynthesis and robustly adapts to physiological states. We show that cell size in Escherichia coli can be predicted for any steady-state condition by projecting all biosynthesis into three measurable variables representing replication initiation, replication-division cycle, and the global biosynthesis rate. These variables can be decoupled by selectively controlling their respective core biosynthesis using CRISPR interference and antibiotics, verifying our predictions that different physiological states can result in the same cell size. We performed extensive growth inhibition experiments, and we discovered that cell size at replication initiation per origin, namely the initiation mass or unit cell, is remarkably invariant under perturbations targeting transcription, translation, ribosome content, replication kinetics, fatty acid and cell wall synthesis, cell division, and cell shape. Based on this invariance and balanced resource allocation, we explain why the total cell size is the sum of all unit cells. These results provide an overarching framework with quantitative predictive power over cell size in bacteria.	F Si|D Li|SE Cox|JT Sauls|O Azizi|C Sou|AB Schwartz|MJ Erickstad|Y Jun|X Li|S Jun

28412663	Rapid and reliable diagnosis of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is crucial for guiding effective patient treatment and preventing the spread of MRSA infections. Nonetheless, further simplification of MRSA detection procedures to shorten detection time and reduce labor relative to that of conventional methods remains a challenge. Here, we have demonstrated a Clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-mediated DNA-FISH method for the simple, rapid and highly sensitive detection of MRSA; this method uses CRISPR associated protein 9/single-guide RNA (dCas9/sgRNA) complex as a targeting material and SYBR Green I (SG I) as a fluorescent probe. A dCas9/sgRNA-SG I based detection approach has advantages over monoclonal antibody in conventional immunoassay systems due to its ability to interact with the target gene in a sequence-specific manner. The detection limit of MRSA was as low as 10 cfu/ml and was found to be sufficient to effectively detect MRSA. Unlike conventional gene diagnosis methods in which PCR must be accompanied or genes are isolated and analyzed, the target gene can be detected within 30min with high sensitivity without performing a gene separation step by using cell lysates. We showed that the fluorescence signal of the MRSA cell lysate was more than 10-fold higher than that of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA). Importantly, the present approach can be applied to any target other than MRSA by simply changing the single-guide RNA (sgRNA) sequence. Because dCas9/sgRNA-SG I based detection approach has proved to be easy, fast, sensitive, and cost-efficient, it can be applied directly at the point of care to detect various pathogens as well as MRSA in this study.

28410976	The CRISPR-Cas genome editing system is very powerful. The format of the CRISPR reagents and the means of delivery are often important factors in targeting efficiency. Delivery of recombinant Cas9 protein and guide RNA (gRNA) as a preformed ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex has recently emerged as a powerful and general approach to genome editing. Here we outline methods to produce and deliver Cas9 RNPs. A donor DNA carrying desired sequence changes can also be included to program precise sequence introduction or replacement. RNP delivery limits exposure to genome editing reagents, reduces off-target events, drives high rates of homology-dependent repair, and can be applied to embryos to rapidly generate animal models. RNP delivery thus minimizes some of the pitfalls of alternative editing modalities and is rapidly being adopted by the genome editing community.	MA DeWitt|JE Corn|D Carroll
28408723	Rapid, inexpensive, and sensitive nucleic acid detection may aid point-of-care pathogen detection, genotyping, and disease monitoring. The RNA-guided, RNA-targeting clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) effector Cas13a (previously known as C2c2) exhibits a "collateral effect" of promiscuous ribonuclease activity upon target recognition. We combine the collateral effect of Cas13a with isothermal amplification to establish a CRISPR-based diagnostic (CRISPR-Dx), providing rapid DNA or RNA detection with attomolar sensitivity and single-base mismatch specificity. We use this Cas13a-based molecular detection platform, termed Specific High-Sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter UnLOCKing (SHERLOCK), to detect specific strains of Zika and Dengue virus, distinguish pathogenic bacteria, genotype human DNA, and identify mutations in cell-free tumor DNA. Furthermore, SHERLOCK reaction reagents can be lyophilized for cold-chain independence and long-term storage and be readily reconstituted on paper for field applications.

28401346	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a complex neurodegenerative disease with cellular and molecular mechanisms yet to be fully described. Mutations in a number of genes including SOD1 and FUS are associated with familial ALS. Here we report the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from fibroblasts of familial ALS patients bearing SOD1 +/A272C and FUS +/G1566A mutations, respectively. We further generated gene corrected ALS iPSCs using CRISPR/Cas9 system. Genome-wide RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of motor neurons derived from SOD1 +/A272C and corrected iPSCs revealed 899 aberrant transcripts. Our work may shed light on discovery of early biomarkers and pathways dysregulated in ALS, as well as provide a basis for novel therapeutic strategies to treat ALS.

28398345	Cas9-linked deaminases, also called base editors, enable targeted mutation of single nucleotides in eukaryotic genomes. However, their off-target activity is largely unknown. Here we modify digested-genome sequencing (Digenome-seq) to assess the specificity of a programmable deaminase composed of a Cas9 nickase (nCas9) and the deaminase APOBEC1 in the human genome. Genomic DNA is treated with the base editor and a mixture of DNA-modifying enzymes in vitro to produce DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) at uracil-containing sites. Off-target sites are then computationally identified from whole genome sequencing data. Testing seven different single guide RNAs (sgRNAs), we find that the rAPOBEC1-nCas9 base editor is highly specific, inducing cytosine-to-uracil conversions at only 18 ± 9 sites in the human genome for each sgRNA. Digenome-seq is sensitive enough to capture off-target sites with a substitution frequency of 0.1%. Notably, off-target sites of the base editors are often different from those of Cas9 alone, calling for independent assessment of their genome-wide specificities.

28397351	There has been an upsurge of interest in xenotransplantation in recent years. This resurgence can attributed to a combination of factors. First, there has been a dramatic improvement in efficacy in several preclinical models, with maximum xenograft survival times increasing to 950 days for islets, 945 days for hearts, and 310 days for kidneys. Second, the rapid development of genome editing technology (particularly the advent of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/Cas9) has revolutionized the capacity to generate new donor pigs with multiple protective genetic modifications; what once took many years to achieve can now be performed in months, with much greater precision and scope. Third, the specter of porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV) has receded significantly. There has been no evidence of PERV transmission in clinical trials and preclinical models, and improved screening methods and new options for the treatment or even elimination of PERV are now available. Balancing these positive developments are several remaining challenges, notably the heavy and often clinically inapplicable immunosuppression required to prevent xenograft rejection. Nonetheless, the potential for xenotransplantation as a solution to the shortage of human organs and tissues for transplantation continues to grow.	PJ Cowan|AJ Tector
28394899	With its airborne transmission and prolonged latency period, Mycobacterium tuberculosis spreads worldwide as one of the most successful bacterial pathogens and continues to kill millions of people every year. M. tuberculosis lineage 1 is inferred to originate ancestrally based on the presence of the 52-bp TbD1 sequence and analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms. Previously, we briefly reported the complete genome sequencing of M. tuberculosis strains 96121 and 96075, which belong to the ancient Manila family and modern Beijing family respectively. Here we present the comprehensive genomic analyses of the Manila family in lineage 1 compared to complete genomes in lineages 2-4. Principal component analysis of the presence and absence of CRISPR spacers suggests that Manila isolate 96121 is distinctly distant from lineages 2-4. We further identify a truncated whiB5 gene and a putative operon consisting of genes encoding a putative serine/threonine kinase PknH and a putative ABC transporter, which are only found in the genomes of Manila family isolates. Six single nucleotide polymorphisms are uniquely conserved in 38 Manila strains. Moreover, when compared to M. tuberculosis H37Rv, 59 proteins are under positive selection in Manila family isolate 96121 but not in Beijing family isolate 96075. The unique features further serve as biomarkers for Manila strains and may shed light on the limited transmission of this ancestral lineage outside of its Filipino host population.

28392568	Gene-editing technology is an emerging therapeutic modality for manipulating the eukaryotic genome by using target-sequence-specific engineered nucleases. Because of the exceptional advantages that gene-editing technology offers in facilitating the accurate correction of sequences in a genome, gene editing-based therapy is being aggressively developed as a next-generation therapeutic approach to treat a wide range of diseases. However, strategies for precise engineering and delivery of gene-editing nucleases, including zinc finger nucleases, transcription activator-like effector nuclease, and CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-associated nuclease Cas9), present major obstacles to the development of gene-editing therapies, as with other gene-targeting therapeutics. Currently, viral and non-viral vectors are being studied for the delivery of these nucleases into cells in the form of DNA, mRNA, or proteins. Clinical trials are already ongoing, and in vivo studies are actively investigating the applicability of CRISPR/Cas9 techniques. However, the concept of correcting the genome poses major concerns from a regulatory perspective, especially in terms of safety. This review addresses current research trends and delivery strategies for gene editing-based therapeutics in non-clinical and clinical settings and considers the associated regulatory issues.

28392263	The ability to introduce targeted edits in the genome of model organisms is revolutionizing the field of genetics. State-of-the-art methods for precision genome editing use RNA-guided endonucleases to create double-strand breaks (DSBs) and DNA templates containing the edits to repair the DSBs. Following this strategy, we have developed a protocol to create precise edits in the C. elegans genome. The protocol takes advantage of two innovations to improve editing efficiency: direct injection of CRISPR-Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes and use of linear DNAs with short homology arms as repair templates. The protocol requires no cloning or selection, and can be used to generate base and gene-size edits in just 4days. Point mutations, insertions, deletions and gene replacements can all be created using the same experimental pipeline.	A Paix|A Folkmann|G Seydoux

28391682	Many nonconventional yeast species have highly desirable features that are not possessed by model yeasts, despite that significant technology hurdles to effectively manipulate them lay in front. Scheffersomyces stipitis is one of the most important exemplary nonconventional yeasts in biorenewables industry, which has a high native xylose utilization capacity. Recent study suggested its much better potential than Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a well-suited microbial biomanufacturing platform for producing high-value compounds derived from shikimate pathway, many of which are associated with potent nutraceutical or pharmaceutical properties. However, the broad application of S. stipitis is hampered by the lack of stable episomal expression platforms and precise genome-editing tools. Here we report the success in pinpointing the centromeric DNA as the partitioning element to guarantee stable extra-chromosomal DNA segregation. The identified centromeric sequence not only stabilized episomal plasmid, enabled homogeneous gene expression, increased the titer of a commercially relevant compound by 3-fold, and also dramatically increased gene knockout efficiency from <1% to more than 80% with the expression of CRISPR components on the new stable plasmid. This study elucidated that establishment of a stable minichromosome-like expression platform is key to achieving functional modifications of nonconventional yeast species in order to expand the current collection of microbial factories.

28388235	The analysis of pharmaceutical industry data indicates that the major reason for drug candidates failing in late stage clinical development is lack of efficacy, with a high proportion of these due to erroneous hypotheses about target to disease linkage. More than ever, there is a requirement to better understand potential new drug targets and their role in disease biology in order to reduce attrition in drug development. Genome editing technology enables precise modification of individual protein coding genes, as well as noncoding regulatory sequences, enabling the elucidation of functional effects in human disease relevant cellular systems. Areas covered: This article outlines applications of CRISPR genome editing technology in target identification and target validation studies. Expert opinion: Applications of CRISPR technology in target validation studies are in evidence and gaining momentum. Whilst technical challenges remain, we are on the cusp of CRISPR being applied in complex cell systems such as iPS derived differentiated cells and stem cell derived organoids. In the meantime, our experience to date suggests that precise genome editing of putative targets in primary cell systems is possible, offering more human disease relevant systems than conventional cell lines.

28386024	Skeletal muscle formation occurs through fusion of myoblasts to form multinucleated myofibers. From a genome-wide clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) loss-of-function screen for genes required for myoblast fusion and myogenesis, we discovered an 84-amino acid muscle-specific peptide that we call Myomixer. Myomixer expression coincides with myoblast differentiation and is essential for fusion and skeletal muscle formation during embryogenesis. Myomixer localizes to the plasma membrane, where it promotes myoblast fusion and associates with Myomaker, a fusogenic membrane protein. Myomixer together with Myomaker can also induce fibroblast-fibroblast fusion and fibroblast-myoblast fusion. We conclude that the Myomixer-Myomaker pair controls the critical step in myofiber formation during muscle development.

In this issue, Bence and colleagues combined auxin-inducible degradation with CRISPR, establishing an elegant tool to control protein levels.

28379481	Prokaryotes memorize invader information by incorporating alien DNA as spacers into CRISPR arrays. Although the spacer size has been suggested to be predefined by the architecture of the acquisition complex, there is usually an unexpected heterogeneity. Here, we explored the causes of this heterogeneity in Haloarcula hispanica I-B CRISPR. High-throughput sequencing following adaptation assays demonstrated significant size variation among 37 957 new spacers, which appeared to be sequence-dependent. Consistently, the third nucleotide at the spacer 3΄-end (PAM-distal end) showed an evident bias for cytosine and mutating this cytosine in the protospacer sequence could change the final spacer size. In addition, slippage of the 5΄-end (PAM-end), which contributed to most of the observed PAM (protospacer adjacent motif) inaccuracy, also tended to change the spacer size. We propose that both ends of the PAM-protospacer sequence should exhibit nucleotide selectivity (with different stringencies), which fine-tunes the structural ruler, to a certain extent, to specify the spacer size.

28375731	Many bacterial clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated (Cas) systems employ the dual RNA-guided DNA endonuclease Cas9 to defend against invading phages and conjugative plasmids by introducing site-specific double-stranded breaks in target DNA. Target recognition strictly requires the presence of a short protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) flanking the target site, and subsequent R-loop formation and strand scission are driven by complementary base pairing between the guide RNA and target DNA, Cas9-DNA interactions, and associated conformational changes. The use of CRISPR-Cas9 as an RNA-programmable DNA targeting and editing platform is simplified by a synthetic single-guide RNA (sgRNA) mimicking the natural dual trans-activating CRISPR RNA (tracrRNA)-CRISPR RNA (crRNA) structure. This review aims to provide an in-depth mechanistic and structural understanding of Cas9-mediated RNA-guided DNA targeting and cleavage. Molecular insights from biochemical and structural studies provide a framework for rational engineering aimed at altering catalytic function, guide RNA specificity, and PAM requirements and reducing off-target activity for the development of Cas9-based therapies against genetic diseases.

28375596	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats interference (CRISPRi) is an emerging technology for artificial gene regulation. Type II CRISPR-Cas endonuclease Cas9 is the most widely used protein for gene regulation with CRISPRi. Here, we present type V-A CRISPR-Cas endonuclease Cpf1-based CRISPRi. We constructed an l-rhamnose-inducible CRISPRi system with DNase-deactivated Cpf1 from Eubacterium eligens (EedCpf1) and compared its performance with catalytically deactivated Cas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes (SpdCas9). In contrast to SpdCas9, EedCpf1 showed stronger gene repression when it was targeted to the template strand than when it was targeted to the nontemplate strand of the 5' untranslated region or coding DNA sequences. EedCpf1 exhibited no strand bias when targeted to the promoter, and preferentially used the 5'-TTTV-3' (V = A, G, or C) protospacer adjacent motif. Multiplex repression of the EedCpf1-based CRISPRi system was demonstrated using episomal and chromosomal gene targets. Our findings will guide an efficient EedCpf1-mediated CRISPRi genetic control.

28371222	CRISPR-mediated genome editing using the Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 enzyme is revolutionizing life science by providing new, precise, facile and high-throughput tools for genetic modification by the specific targeting of double-strand breaks in the genome of hosts. Plant biotechnologists have extensively used the S. pyogenes Cas9-based system since its inception in 2013. However, there are still some limitations to its even broader usage in plants. Major restrictions, especially in agricultural biotechnology, are the currently unclear regulatory status of plants modified with CRISPR/Cas9 and the lack of suitable delivery methods for some plant species. Solutions to these limitations could come in the form of new variants of genome editing enzymes that have recently been discovered and have already proved comparable to or even better in performance than S. pyogenes CRISPR/Cas9 in terms of precision and ease of delivery in mammal cells. Although some of them have already been tested in plants, most of them are less well known in the plant science community. In this review, we describe the following new enzyme systems engineered for genome editing, transcriptional regulation and cellular imaging-C2c2 from L. shahii; Cas9 from F. novicida, S. aureus, S. thermophiles, N. meningitidis; Cpf1 from F. novicida, Acidaminococcus and Lachnospiraceae; nickase, split, enhanced and other Cas9 variants from S. pyogenes; catalytically inactive SpCas9 linked to various nuclease or gene-regulating domains-with an emphasis on their advantages in comparison with the broadly used SpCas9. In addition, we discuss new possibilities they offer in plant biotechnology.	J Murovec|Ž Pirc|B Yang
28369033	Large genome-mapping consortia and thousands of genome-wide association studies have identified non-protein-coding elements in the genome as having a central role in various biological processes. However, decoding the functions of the millions of putative regulatory elements discovered in these studies remains challenging. CRISPR-Cas9-based epigenome editing technologies have enabled precise perturbation of the activity of specific regulatory elements. Here we describe CRISPR-Cas9-based epigenomic regulatory element screening (CERES) for improved high-throughput screening of regulatory element activity in the native genomic context. Using dCas9KRAB repressor and dCas9p300 activator constructs and lentiviral single guide RNA libraries to target DNase I hypersensitive sites surrounding a gene of interest, we carried out both loss- and gain-of-function screens to identify regulatory elements for the β-globin and HER2 loci in human cells. CERES readily identified known and previously unidentified regulatory elements, some of which were dependent on cell type or direction of perturbation. This technology allows the high-throughput functional annotation of putative regulatory elements in their native chromosomal context.

28366764	CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9)-mediated genome editing provides a promising cure for HIV-1/AIDS; however, gene delivery efficiency in vivo remains an obstacle to overcome. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of excising the HIV-1 provirus in three different animal models using an all-in-one adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector to deliver multiplex single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) plus Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 (saCas9). The quadruplex sgRNAs/saCas9 vector outperformed the duplex vector in excising the integrated HIV-1 genome in cultured neural stem/progenitor cells from HIV-1 Tg26 transgenic mice. Intravenously injected quadruplex sgRNAs/saCas9 AAV-DJ/8 excised HIV-1 proviral DNA and significantly reduced viral RNA expression in several organs/tissues of Tg26 mice. In EcoHIV acutely infected mice, intravenously injected quadruplex sgRNAs/saCas9 AAV-DJ/8 reduced systemic EcoHIV infection, as determined by live bioluminescence imaging. Additionally, this quadruplex vector induced efficient proviral excision, as determined by PCR genotyping in the liver, lungs, brain, and spleen. Finally, in humanized bone marrow/liver/thymus (BLT) mice with chronic HIV-1 infection, successful proviral excision was detected by PCR genotyping in the spleen, lungs, heart, colon, and brain after a single intravenous injection of quadruplex sgRNAs/saCas9 AAV-DJ/8. In conclusion, in vivo excision of HIV-1 proviral DNA by sgRNAs/saCas9 in solid tissues/organs can be achieved via AAV delivery, a significant step toward human clinical trials.

28363792	The application of CRISPR/Cas9 technology has revolutionised genetics by greatly enhancing the efficacy of genome editing in the early embryo. Furthermore, the system has enabled the generation of allele types previously incompatible with in vivo mutagenesis. Despite its versatility and ease of implementation, CRISPR/Cas9 editing outcome is unpredictable and can generate mosaic founders. Therefore, careful genotyping and characterisation of new mutants is proving essential. The literature presents a wide range of protocols for molecular characterisation, each representing different levels of investment. We present strategies and protocols for designing, producing and screening CRISPR/Cas9 edited founders and genotyping their offspring according to desired allele type (indel, point mutation and deletion).

28359840	SAMHD1 is a triphosphohydrolase that restricts HIV-1 by limiting the intracellular dNTP pool required for reverse transcription. Although SAMHD1 is expressed and active/unphosphorylated in most cell lines, its restriction activity is thought to be relevant only in non-cycling cells. However, an in depth evaluation of SAMHD1 function and relevance in cycling cells is required. Here, we show that SAMHD1-induced degradation by HIV-2 Vpx affects the dNTP pool and HIV-1 replication capacity in the presence of the 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) in cycling cells. Similarly, in SAMHD1 knockout cells, HIV-1 showed increased replicative capacity in the presence of nucleoside inhibitors, especially AZT, that was reverted by re-expression of wild type SAMHD1. Sensitivity to non-nucleoside inhibitors (nevirapine and efavirenz) or the integrase inhibitor raltegravir was not affected by SAMHD1. Combination of three mutations (S18A, T21A, T25A) significantly prevented SAMHD1 phosphorylation but did not significantly affect HIV-1 replication in the presence of AZT. Our results demonstrate that SAMHD1 is active in HIV-1 permissive cells, does not modify susceptibility to HIV-1 infection but strongly affects sensitivity to nucleoside inhibitors.

28358422	Elevated blood glucose levels contribute to a series of complications in patients with diabetes mellitus, including chronic ulcers and accelerated atherosclerosis. Dysregulated endothelial migration induced by high glucose is important in vascular‑associated complications. In the present study, cluster of differentiation (CD)97/adhesion G protein‑coupled receptor 5 (ADGRE5), a member of the G protein‑coupled receptor protein family, stimulated angiogenesis was investigated to determine its role in cell models of diabetes mellitus using lentivirus‑mediated overexpression and siRNA transfection. The results revealed reduced expression in high glucose‑treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells and in the endothelium of diabetic mice. Among the three CD97 isoforms, the majority of the expression of CD97 (EGF1,2,5) in the endothelial cells was regulated by high levels of glucose. Using stable lentivirus‑mediated transfection and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR‑associated protein 9 (Cas9) technology, the present study constructed CD97‑overexpression and CD97‑knockout endothelial cell lines. Migration assays showed that the lentivirus‑mediated overexpression of CD97/ADGRE5 improved the inhibition of high glucose‑induced endothelial cell migration. In addition, using cytoskeleton staining, it was found that CD97 promoted membrane ruffling and lamellipodia formation. Cell division cycle 42, a small GTP‑binding protein, and its downstream factor, actin‑related protein 2, were involved in CD97‑induced actin reorganization in endothelial cells. Additionally, the use of transcription factor filter plate assays revealed that the nuclear translocation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 stimulated by high glucose contributed to the inhibited transcription of CD97. In conclusion, the present study established that the overexpression of CD97 improved high glucose‑induced dysfunction of endothelial cell migration. These findings provide insight to assist in identifying therapeutic targets with potential to ameliorate certain vascular complications of diabetes.	W Zhao|Z Wang|Z Sun|S Wang|M Wu|L Zheng
28355536	Live imaging of genome has offered important insights into the dynamics of the genome organization and gene expression. The demand to image simultaneously multiple genomic loci has prompted a flurry of exciting advances in multicolor CRISPR imaging, although color-based multiplexing is limited by the need for spectrally distinct fluorophores. Here we introduce an approach to achieve highly multiplexed live recording via correlative CRISPR imaging and sequential DNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). This approach first performs one-color live imaging of multiple genomic loci and then uses sequential rounds of DNA FISH to determine the loci identity. We have optimized the FISH protocol so that each round is complete in 1 min, demonstrating the identification of seven genomic elements and the capability to sustain reversible staining and washing for up to 20 rounds. We have also developed a correlation-based algorithm to faithfully register live and FISH images. Our approach keeps the rest of the color palette open to image other cellular phenomena of interest, as demonstrated by our simultaneous live imaging of genomic loci together with a cell cycle reporter. Furthermore, the algorithm to register faithfully between live and fixed imaging is directly transferrable to other systems such as multiplex RNA imaging with RNA-FISH and multiplex protein imaging with antibody-staining.

28355179	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas systems provide protection against viral and plasmid infection by capturing short DNA sequences from these invaders and integrating them into the CRISPR locus of the prokaryotic host. These sequences, known as spacers, are transcribed into short CRISPR RNA guides that specify the cleavage site of Cas nucleases in the genome of the invader. It is not known when spacer sequences are acquired during viral infection. Here, to investigate this, we tracked spacer acquisition in Staphylococcus aureus cells harbouring a type II CRISPR-Cas9 system after infection with the staphylococcal bacteriophage ϕ12. We found that new spacers were acquired immediately after infection preferentially from the cos site, the viral free DNA end that is first injected into the cell. Analysis of spacer acquisition after infection with mutant phages demonstrated that most spacers are acquired during DNA injection, but not during other stages of the viral cycle that produce free DNA ends, such as DNA replication or packaging. Finally, we showed that spacers acquired from early-injected genomic regions, which direct Cas9 cleavage of the viral DNA immediately after infection, provide better immunity than spacers acquired from late-injected regions. Our results reveal that CRISPR-Cas systems exploit the phage life cycle to generate a pattern of spacer acquisition that ensures a successful CRISPR immune response.	JW Modell|W Jiang|LA Marraffini
28351759	Genome editing using the CRISPR/Cas9 system requires the presence of guide RNAs bound to the Cas9 endonuclease as a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex in cells, which cleaves the host cell genome at sites specified by the guide RNAs. New genetic material may be introduced during repair of the double-stranded break via homology dependent repair (HDR) if suitable DNA templates are delivered with the CRISPR components. Early methods used plasmid or viral vectors to make these components in the host cell, however newer approaches using recombinant Cas9 protein with synthetic guide RNAs introduced directly as an RNP complex into cells shows faster onset of action with fewer off-target effects. This approach also enables use of chemically modified synthetic guide RNAs that have improved nuclease stability and reduces the risk of triggering an innate immune response in the host cell. This article provides detailed methods for genome editing using the RNP approach with synthetic guide RNAs using lipofection or electroporation in mammalian cells or using microinjection in murine zygotes, with or without addition of a single-stranded HDR template DNA.

28349358	CRISPR-Cas9/Cpf1 system with its unique gene targeting efficiency, could be an important tool for functional study of early developmental genes through the generation of successful knockout plants. The introduction and utilization of systems biology approaches have identified several genes that are involved in early development of a plant and with such knowledge a robust tool is required for the functional validation of putative candidate genes thus obtained. The development of the CRISPR-Cas9/Cpf1 genome editing system has provided a convenient tool for creating loss of function mutants for genes of interest. The present study utilized CRISPR/Cas9 and CRISPR-Cpf1 technology to knock out an early developmental gene EPFL9 (Epidermal Patterning Factor like-9, a positive regulator of stomatal development in Arabidopsis) orthologue in rice. Germ-line mutants that were generated showed edits that were carried forward into the T2 generation when Cas9-free homozygous mutants were obtained. The homozygous mutant plants showed more than an eightfold reduction in stomatal density on the abaxial leaf surface of the edited rice plants. Potential off-target analysis showed no significant off-target effects. This study also utilized the CRISPR-LbCpf1 (Lachnospiracae bacterium Cpf1) to target the same OsEPFL9 gene to test the activity of this class-2 CRISPR system in rice and found that Cpf1 is also capable of genome editing and edits get transmitted through generations with similar phenotypic changes seen with CRISPR-Cas9. This study demonstrates the application of CRISPR-Cas9/Cpf1 to precisely target genomic locations and develop transgene-free homozygous heritable gene edits and confirms that the loss of function analysis of the candidate genes emerging from different systems biology based approaches, could be performed, and therefore, this system adds value in the validation of gene function studies.

28344037	Recently the Cas9, an RNA guided DNA endonuclease, emerged as a powerful tool for targeted genome manipulations. Cas9 protein can be reprogrammed to cleave, bind or nick any DNA target by simply changing crRNA sequence, however a short nucleotide sequence, termed PAM, is required to initiate crRNA hybridization to the DNA target. PAM sequence is recognized by Cas9 protein and must be determined experimentally for each Cas9 variant. Exploration of Cas9 orthologs could offer a diversity of PAM sequences and novel biochemical properties that may be beneficial for genome editing applications. Here we briefly review and compare Cas9 PAM identification assays that can be adopted for other PAM-dependent CRISPR-Cas systems.	T Karvelis|G Gasiunas|V Siksnys
28342760	Hirschsprung disease is caused by failure of enteric neural crest cells (ENCCs) to fully colonize the bowel, leading to bowel obstruction and megacolon. Heterozygous mutations in the coding region of the RET gene cause a severe form of Hirschsprung disease (total colonic aganglionosis). However, 80% of HSCR patients have short-segment Hirschsprung disease (S-HSCR), which has not been associated with genetic factors. We sought to identify mutations associated with S-HSCR, and used the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 gene editing system to determine how mutations affect ENCC function.	We created induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from 1 patient with total colonic aganglionosis (with the G731del mutation in RET) and from 2 patients with S-HSCR (without a RET mutation), as well as RET+/- and RET-/- iPSCs. IMR90-iPSC cells were used as the control cell line. Migration and differentiation capacities of iPSC-derived ENCCs were analyzed in differentiation and migration assays. We searched for mutation(s) associated with S-HSCR by combining genetic and transcriptome data from patient blood- and iPSC-derived ENCCs, respectively. Mutations in the iPSCs were corrected using the CRISPR/Cas9 system.	ENCCs derived from all iPSC lines, but not control iPSCs, had defects in migration and neuronal lineage differentiation. RET mutations were associated with differentiation and migration defects of ENCCs in vitro. Genetic and transcriptome analyses associated a mutation in the vinculin gene (VCL M209L) with S-HSCR. CRISPR/Cas9 correction of the RET G731del and VCL M209L mutations in iPSCs restored the differentiation and migration capacities of ENCCs.	We identified mutations in VCL associated with S-HSCR. Correction of this mutation in iPSC using CRISPR/Cas9 editing, as well as the RET G731del mutation that causes Hirschsprung disease with total colonic aganglionosis, restored ENCC function. Our study demonstrates how human iPSCs can be used to identify disease-associated mutations and determine how they affect cell functions and contribute to pathogenesis.

28340349	Genetic conflict between viruses and their hosts drives evolution and genetic innovation. Prokaryotes evolved CRISPR-mediated adaptive immune systems for protection from viral infection, and viruses have evolved diverse anti-CRISPR (Acr) proteins that subvert these immune systems. The adaptive immune system in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (type I-F) relies on a 350 kDa CRISPR RNA (crRNA)-guided surveillance complex (Csy complex) to bind foreign DNA and recruit a trans-acting nuclease for target degradation. Here, we report the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the Csy complex bound to two different Acr proteins, AcrF1 and AcrF2, at an average resolution of 3.4 Å. The structure explains the molecular mechanism for immune system suppression, and structure-guided mutations show that the Acr proteins bind to residues essential for crRNA-mediated detection of DNA. Collectively, these data provide a snapshot of an ongoing molecular arms race between viral suppressors and the immune system they target.

28337020	With the recent development of CRISPR technology, it is becoming increasingly easy to engineer the genome. Genome-editing systems based on CRISPR, as well as transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs), are becoming valuable tools for biomedical research, drug discovery and development, and even gene therapy. However, for each of these systems to effectively enter cells of interest and perform their function, efficient and safe delivery technologies are needed. This Review discusses the principles of biomacromolecule delivery and gene editing, examines recent advances and challenges in non-viral and viral delivery methods, and highlights the status of related clinical trials.

28336542	RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) control the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotic genomes at post-transcriptional level by binding to their cognate RNAs. Although several variants of CLIP (crosslinking and immunoprecipitation) protocols are currently available to study the global protein-RNA interaction landscape at single-nucleotide resolution in a cell, currently there are very few tools that can facilitate understanding and dissecting the functional associations of RBPs from the resulting binding maps. Here, we present Seten, a web-based and command line tool, which can identify and compare processes, phenotypes, and diseases associated with RBPs from condition-specific CLIP-seq profiles. Seten uses BED files resulting from most peak calling algorithms, which include scores reflecting the extent of binding of an RBP on the target transcript, to provide both traditional functional enrichment as well as gene set enrichment results for a number of gene set collections including BioCarta, KEGG, Reactome, Gene Ontology (GO), Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO), and MalaCards Disease Ontology for several organisms including fruit fly, human, mouse, rat, worm, and yeast. It also provides an option to dynamically compare the associated gene sets across data sets as bubble charts, to facilitate comparative analysis. Benchmarking of Seten using eCLIP data for IGF2BP1, SRSF7, and PTBP1 against their corresponding CRISPR RNA-seq in K562 cells as well as randomized negative controls, demonstrated that its gene set enrichment method outperforms functional enrichment, with scores significantly contributing to the discovery of true annotations. Comparative performance analysis using these CRISPR control data sets revealed significantly higher precision and comparable recall to that observed using ChIP-Enrich. Seten's web interface currently provides precomputed results for about 200 CLIP-seq data sets and both command line as well as web interfaces can be used to analyze CLIP-seq data sets. We highlight several examples to show the utility of Seten for rapid profiling of various CLIP-seq data sets. Seten is available on http://www.iupui.edu/∼sysbio/seten/.	G Budak|R Srivastava|SC Janga
28334154	The avalanche of commentaries on CRISPR-Cas9 technology, a bacterial immune system modified to recognize any short DNA sequence, cut it out, and insert a new one, has rekindled hopes for gene therapy and other applications and raised criticisms of engineering genes in future generations.	This discussion draws on articles that emphasize ethics, identified partly through PubMed and Google, 2014-2016.	CRISPR-Cas9 has taken the pace and prospects for genetic discovery and applications to a high level, stoking anticipation for somatic gene engineering to help patients. We support a moratorium on germ line manipulation.	We place increased emphasis on the principle of solidarity and the public good. The genetic bases of some diseases are not thoroughly addressable with CRISPR-Cas9. We see no new ethical issues, compared with gene therapy and genetic engineering in general, apart from the explosive rate of findings. Other controversies include eugenics, patentability and unrealistic expectations of professionals and the public.	Biggest issues are the void of research on human germ cell biology, the appropriate routes for oversight and transparency, and the scientific and ethical areas of reproductive medicine.	The principle of genomic solidarity and priority on public good should be a lens for bringing clarity to CRISPR debates. The valid claim of genetic exceptionalism supports restraint on experimentation in human germ cells, given the trans-generational dangers and the knowledge gap in germ cell biology.

28334141	Enterococcus faecalis represents an important factor of hospital-associated infections (HAIs). The knowledge on its evolution from a commensal to an opportunistic pathogen is still limited; thus, we performed a study to characterise distribution of factors that may contribute to this adaptation. Using a collection obtained from various settings (hospitalised patients, community carriers, animals, fresh food, sewage, water), we investigated differences in antimicrobial susceptibility, distribution of antimicrobial resistance genes, virulence-associated determinants and phenotypes, and CRISPR loci in the context of the clonal relatedness of isolates. Bayesian Analysis of Population Structure revealed the presence of three major groups; two subgroups comprised almost exclusively HAI isolates, belonging to previously proposed enterococcal high-risk clonal complexes (HiRECCs) 6 and 28. Isolates of these two subgroups were significantly enriched in antimicrobial resistance genes, presumably produced a polysaccharide capsule and often carried the aggregation substance asa1; distribution of other virulence-associated genes, such as esp and cyl, formation of a biofilm and gelatinase production were more variable. Moreover, both subgroups showed a low prevalence of CRISPR-Cas 1 and 3 and presence of small CRISPR2 variants. Our study confirms the importance of HiRECCs in the population of E. faecalis and their confinement to the hospital settings.

28325845	Large numbers of long noncoding RNAs have been discovered in recent years, but only a few have been characterized. NEAT1 (nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1) is a mammalian long noncoding RNA that is important for the reproductive physiology of mice, cancer development, and the formation of subnuclear bodies termed paraspeckles. The two major isoforms of NEAT1 (3.7 kb NEAT1_1 and 23 kb NEAT1_2 in human) are generated from a common promoter and are produced through the use of alternative transcription termination sites. This gene structure has made the functional relationship between the two isoforms difficult to dissect. Here we used CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing to create several different cell lines: total NEAT1 knockout cells, cells that only express the short form NEAT1_1, and cells with twofold more NEAT1_2. Using these reagents, we obtained evidence that NEAT1_1 is not a major component of paraspeckles. In addition, our data suggest NEAT1_1 localizes in numerous nonparaspeckle foci we termed "microspeckles," which may carry paraspeckle-independent functions. This study highlights the complexity of lncRNA and showcases how genome editing tools are useful in dissecting the structural and functional roles of overlapping transcripts.

28324494	Telomeres play an important role in ensuring the integrity of the genome. Telomere shortening can lead to loss of genetic information and trigger DNA damage responses. Cultured mammalian cells have served as critical model systems for studying the function of telomere binding proteins and telomerase. Tremendous heterogeneity can be observed both between species and within a single cell population. Recent advances in genome editing (such as the development of the CRISPR/Cas9 platform) have further enabled researchers to carry out loss-of-function analysis of how disrupting key players in telomere maintenance affects telomere length regulation. Here we describe the steps to be carried out in order to analyze the average length of telomeres in CRISPR-engineered human knockout (KO) cells (TRF analysis).	J Xu|Z Songyang|D Liu|H Kim

We targeted all pairs of 73 cancer genes with dual guide RNAs in three cell lines, comprising 141,912 tests of interaction. Numerous therapeutically relevant interactions were identified, and these patterns replicated with combinatorial drugs at 75% precision. From these results, we anticipate that cellular context will be critical to synthetic-lethal therapies.

28319085	Identification of effective combination therapies is critical to address the emergence of drug-resistant cancers, but direct screening of all possible drug combinations is infeasible. Here we introduce a CRISPR-based double knockout (CDKO) system that improves the efficiency of combinatorial genetic screening using an effective strategy for cloning and sequencing paired single guide RNA (sgRNA) libraries and a robust statistical scoring method for calculating genetic interactions (GIs) from CRISPR-deleted gene pairs. We applied CDKO to generate a large-scale human GI map, comprising 490,000 double-sgRNAs directed against 21,321 pairs of drug targets in K562 leukemia cells and identified synthetic lethal drug target pairs for which corresponding drugs exhibit synergistic killing. These included the BCL2L1 and MCL1 combination, which was also effective in imatinib-resistant cells. We further validated this system by identifying known and previously unidentified GIs between modifiers of ricin toxicity. This work provides an effective strategy to screen synergistic drug combinations in high-throughput and a CRISPR-based tool to dissect functional GI networks.

28315486	The increasing burden of the world's population on agriculture necessitates the development of more robust crops. As the amount of information from sequenced crop genomes increases, technology can be used to investigate the function of genes in detail and to design improved crops at the molecular level. Recently, an RNA-programmed genome-editing system composed of a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-encoded guide RNA and the nuclease Cas9 has provided a powerful platform to achieve these goals. By combining versatile tools to study and modify plants at different molecular levels, the CRISPR/Cas9 system is paving the way towards a new horizon for basic research and crop development. In this review, the accomplishments, problems and improvements of this technology in plants, including target sequence cleavage, knock-in/gene replacement, transcriptional regulation, epigenetic modification, off-target effects, delivery system and potential applications, will be highlighted.

28301575	In this study, the CRISPR/Cas9 technology was used to establish murine tumor cell lines, devoid of MHC I or MHC II surface expression, respectively. The melanoma cell line B16F10 and the murine breast cancer cell line EO-771, the latter stably expressing the tumor antigen NY-BR-1 (EO-NY), were transfected with an expression plasmid encoding a β2m-specific single guide (sg)RNA and Cas9. The resulting MHC I negative cells were sorted by flow cytometry to obtain single cell clones, and loss of susceptibility of peptide pulsed MHC I negative clones to peptide-specific CTL recognition was determined by IFNγ ELISpot assay. The β2m knockout (KO) clones did not give rise to tumors in syngeneic mice (C57BL/6N), unless NK cells were depleted, suggesting that outgrowth of the β2m KO cell lines was controlled by NK cells. Using sgRNAs targeting the β-chain encoding locus of the IAb molecule we also generated several B16F10 MHC II KO clones. Peptide loaded B16F10 MHC II KO cells were insusceptible to recognition by OT-II cells and tumor growth was unaltered compared to parental B16F10 cells. Thus, in our hands the CRISPR/Cas9 system has proven to be an efficient straight forward strategy for the generation of MHC knockout cell lines. Such cell lines could serve as parental cells for co-transfection of compatible HLA alleles together with human tumor antigens of interest, thereby facilitating the generation of HLA matched transplantable tumor models, e.g. in HLAtg mouse strains of the newer generation, lacking cell surface expression of endogenous H2 molecules. In addition, our tumor cell lines established might offer a useful tool to investigate tumor reactive T cell responses that function independently from MHC molecule surface expression by the tumor.

28300641	With its variety of applications, the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology has been rapidly evolving in the last few years. In the zebrafish community, knock-out reports are constantly increasing but insertion studies have been so far more challenging. With this review, we aim at giving an overview of the homologous directed repair (HDR)-based knock-in generation in zebrafish. We address the critical points and limitations of the procedure such as cutting efficiency of the chosen single guide RNA, use of cas9 mRNA or Cas9 protein, homology arm size etc. but also ways to circumvent encountered issues with HDR insertions by the development of non-homologous dependent strategies. While imprecise, these homology-independent mechanisms based on non-homologous-end-joining (NHEJ) repair have been employed in zebrafish to generate reporter lines or to accurately edit an open reading frame by the use of intron-targeting modifications. Therefore, with higher efficiency and insertion rate, NHEJ-based knock-in seems to be a promising approach to target endogenous loci and to circumvent the limitations of HDR whenever it is possible and appropriate. In this perspective, we propose new strategies to generate cDNA edited or tagged insertions, which once established will constitute a new and versatile toolbox for CRISPR/Cas9-based knock-ins in zebrafish.

28298224	Transcriptional reprogramming is a fundamental process of living cells in order to adapt to environmental and endogenous cues. In order to allow flexible and timely control over gene expression without the interference of native gene expression machinery, a large number of studies have focused on developing synthetic biology tools for orthogonal control of transcription. Most recently, the nuclease-deficient Cas9 (dCas9) has emerged as a flexible tool for controlling activation and repression of target genes, by the simple RNA-guided positioning of dCas9 in the vicinity of the target gene transcription start site.	In this study we compared two different systems of dCas9-mediated transcriptional reprogramming, and applied them to genes controlling two biosynthetic pathways for biobased production of isoprenoids and triacylglycerols (TAGs) in baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. By testing 101 guide-RNA (gRNA) structures on a total of 14 different yeast promoters, we identified the best-performing combinations based on reporter assays. Though a larger number of gRNA-promoter combinations do not perturb gene expression, some gRNAs support expression perturbations up to ~threefold. The best-performing gRNAs were used for single and multiplex reprogramming strategies for redirecting flux related to isoprenoid production and optimization of TAG profiles. From these studies, we identified both constitutive and inducible multiplex reprogramming strategies enabling significant changes in isoprenoid production and increases in TAG.	Taken together, we show similar performance for a constitutive and an inducible dCas9 approach, and identify multiplex gRNA designs that can significantly perturb isoprenoid production and TAG profiles in yeast without editing the genomic context of the target genes. We also identify a large number of gRNA positions in 14 native yeast target pomoters that do not affect expression, suggesting the need for further optimization of gRNA design tools and dCas9 engineering.

28288828	Methodologies to interrogate non-coding regions have lagged behind coding regions despite comprising the vast majority of the genome. However, the rapid evolution of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based genome editing has provided a multitude of novel techniques for laboratory investigation including significant contributions to the toolbox for studying non-coding DNA. CRISPR-mediated loss-of-function strategies rely on direct disruption of the underlying sequence or repression of transcription without modifying the targeted DNA sequence. CRISPR-mediated gain-of-function approaches similarly benefit from methods to alter the targeted sequence through integration of customized sequence into the genome as well as methods to activate transcription. Here we review CRISPR-based loss- and gain-of-function techniques for the interrogation of non-coding DNA.	MC Canver|DE Bauer|SH Orkin
28288827	The CRISPR/Cas9 revolution has democratized access to genome editing in many biological fields, including cancer research. Cancer results from the multistep accumulation of mutations that confer to the transformed cells certain biological hallmarks typical of the malignant phenotype. One of the major goals in cancer research is to characterize such mutations and assess their implication in the oncogenic process. Through CRISPR/Cas9 technology, genetic aberrations identified in a patient's tumor can now be easily recreated in experimental models, which can then be used for basic research or for more translational applications. Here we review the different CRISPR/Cas9 strategies that have been implemented to recapitulate oncogenic mutations in both in vitro and in vivo systems, including novel strategies to model tumor evolution and genetic heterogeneity.

28288698	CRISPR/Cas9 is the latest tool introduced in the field of genome engineering and is so far the best genome-editing tool as compared to its precedents such as, meganucleases, zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effectors (TALENs). The simple design and assembly of the CRISPR/Cas9 system makes genome editing easy to perform as it uses small guide RNAs that correspond to their DNA targets for high efficiency editing. This has helped open the doors for multiplexible genome targeting in many species that were intractable using old genetic perturbation techniques. Currently, The CRISPR system is revolutionizing the way biological researches are conducted and paves a bright future not only in research but also in medicine and biotechnology. In this review, we evaluated the history, types and structure, the mechanism of action of CRISPR/Cas System. In particular, we focused on the application of this powerful tool in autophagy research.

28288556	Guide Picker (https://www.deskgen.com/guide-picker/) serves as a meta tool for designing CRISPR experiments by presenting ten different guide RNA scoring functions in one simple graphical interface. It allows investigators to simultaneously visualize and sort through every guide targeting the protein-coding regions of any mouse or human gene.	Utilizing a multidimensional graphical display featuring two plots and four axes, Guide Picker can analyze all guides while filtering based on four different criteria at a time. Guide Picker further facilitates the CRISPR design process by using pre-computed scores for all guides, thereby offering rapid guide RNA generation and selection.	The ease-of-use of Guide Picker complements CRISPR itself, matching a powerful and modular biological system with a flexible online web tool that can be used in a variety of genome editing experimental contexts.

28284774	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR- associated (Cas) protein 9 system is a novel and powerful tool which is widely used for genome editing. CRISPR/Cas9 is RNA-guided and can lead to desired genomic modifications. However, whether the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing causes genomic alterations and genomic instability, such as microsatellite instability (MSI), is still unknown. Here we detected MSI in 21 CRISPR/Cas9 mouse strains using a panel of 42 microsatellite loci which were selected from our previous studies. Surprisingly, MSI occurrence was common in CRISPR/Cas9 modified genome, and most of the strains (19/21, 90.5%) examined showed MSI. Of 42 loci examined, 8 loci (8/42, 19.05%) exhibited MSI in the Cas9 editing mice. The Ttll9 (4/42, 9.5%) were the most unstable strains, and D10Mit3 and D10Mit198 (9/21, 42.9%) were considered to be the most "hot" loci in the Cas9 strains we tested. Through analyzing the mutation of microsatellite loci, we provide new insights into the genomic alterations of CRISPR/Cas9 models and it will help us for a better understanding of this powerful technology.

28284599	This study aimed to characterize the species, antimicrobial resistance and dispersion of CRISPR systems in staphylococci isolated from the oropharynx of domestic cats in Brazil. Staphylococcus strains (n=75) were identified by MALDI-TOF and sequencing of rpoB and tuf genes. Antimicrobial susceptibility was assessed by disk diffusion method and PCR to investigate the presence of antimicrobial-resistance genes usually present in mobile genetic elements (plasmids), in addition to plasmid extraction. CRISPR - genetic arrangements that give the bacteria the ability to resist the entry of exogenous DNA - were investigated by the presence of the essential protein Cas1 gene. A great diversity of Staphylococcus species (n=13) was identified. The presence of understudied species, like S. nepalensis and S. pettenkoferi reveals that more than one identification method may be necessary to achieve conclusive results. At least 56% of the strains contain plamids, being 99% resistant to at least one of the eight tested antimicrobials and 12% multidrug resistant. CRISPR were rare among the studied strains, consistent with their putative role as gene reservoirs. Moreover, herein we describe for the first time their existence in Staphylococcus lentus, to which the system must confer additional adaptive advantage. Prevalence of resistance among staphylococci against antimicrobials used in veterinary and human clinical practice and the zoonotic risk highlight the need of better antimicrobial management practices, as staphylococci may transfer resistance genes among themselves, including to virulent species, like S. aureus.

28280151	Perfect matching of an assembled physical sequence to a specified designed sequence is crucial to verify design principles in genome synthesis. We designed and de novo synthesized 536,024-base pair chromosome synV in the "Build-A-Genome China" course. We corrected an initial isolate of synV to perfectly match the designed sequence using integrative cotransformation and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9)-mediated editing in 22 steps; synV strains exhibit high fitness under a variety of culture conditions, compared with that of wild-type V strains. A ring synV derivative was constructed, which is fully functional in Saccharomyces cerevisiae under all conditions tested and exhibits lower spore viability during meiosis. Ring synV chromosome can extends Sc2.0 design principles and provides a model with which to study genomic rearrangement, ring chromosome evolution, and human ring chromosome disorders.

28280124	Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a stress-activated transcription factor activated by stimuli such as electrophilic compounds and other reactive xenobiotics. Previously, we have shown that the commonly used food additive and Nrf2 activator tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ) suppresses interleukin-2 (IL-2) production, CD25 expression, and NFκB activity in human Jurkat T cells. The purpose of the current studies was to determine whether these effects were dependent upon Nrf2 by developing a human Nrf2-null T cell model using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 technology. The current studies show that suppression of CD25 expression by tBHQ is partially dependent on Nrf2, whereas inhibition of IL-2 secretion is largely Nrf2-independent. Interestingly, tBHQ inhibited NFκB activation in an Nrf2-independent manner. This was an unexpected finding since Nrf2 inhibits NFκB activation in other models. These results led us to investigate another more potent Nrf2 activator, the synthetic triterpenoid 1[2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9(11)-dien-28-oyl]imidazole (CDDO-Im). Treatment of wild-type and Nrf2-null Jurkat T cells with CDDO-Im resulted in an Nrf2-dependent suppression of IL-2. Furthermore, susceptibility to reactive oxygen species was significantly enhanced in the Nrf2-null clones as determined by decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and cell viability. Importantly, this study is the first to describe the generation of a human Nrf2-null model, which is likely to have multiple applications in immunology and cancer biology. Collectively, this study demonstrates a role for Nrf2 in the effects of CDDO-Im on CD25 and IL-2 expression, whereas the effect of tBHQ on these parameters is complex and likely involves modulation of multiple stress-activated transcription factors, including NFκB and Nrf2.

28280061	The β2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR) increases intracellular Ca2+ in a variety of cell types. By combining pharmacological and genetic manipulations, we reveal a novel mechanism through which the β2AR promotes Ca2+ mobilization (pEC50 = 7.32 ± 0.10) in nonexcitable human embryonic kidney (HEK)293S cells. Downregulation of Gs with sustained cholera toxin pretreatment and the use of Gs-null HEK293 (∆Gs-HEK293) cells generated using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat-associated protein-9 nuclease (CRISPR/Cas9) system, combined with pharmacological modulation of cAMP formation, revealed a Gs-dependent but cAMP-independent increase in intracellular Ca2+ following β2AR stimulation. The increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+ was inhibited by P2Y purinergic receptor antagonists as well as a dominant-negative mutant form of Gq, a Gq-selective inhibitor, and an inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor antagonist, suggesting a role for this Gq-coupled receptor family downstream of the β2AR activation. Consistent with this mechanism, β2AR stimulation promoted the extracellular release of ATP, and pretreatment with apyrase inhibited the β2AR-promoted Ca2+ mobilization. Together, these data support a model whereby the β2AR stimulates a Gs-dependent release of ATP, which transactivates Gq-coupled P2Y receptors through an inside-out mechanism, leading to a Gq- and IP3-dependent Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular stores. Given that β2AR and P2Y receptors are coexpressed in various tissues, this novel signaling paradigm could be physiologically important and have therapeutic implications. In addition, this study reports the generation and validation of HEK293 cells deleted of Gs using the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology that will undoubtedly be powerful tools to study Gs-dependent signaling.

28279800	The CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and CRISPR-associated protein 9) system has been widely used for viral genome editing, transcription regulation and chromosomal localization in eukaryotic cells. In this study, a guide RNA (gRNA) that specifically recognizes HSV-1 viral genomes was used in the CRISPR-Cas9 system to inhibit viral replication. This inhibition could be achieved with both wild type Cas9 protein and Cas9 nickase (D10A). By targeting viral genomes containing sequences recognized by the gRNA, the CRISPR-Cas9 system distinguished between different viral genome sequences and provided single nucleotide-specific selection pressure to significantly change the proportions of viruses in a mixed viral pool. This finding indicates the utility of this tool for virus selection without the need for antibiotics or reporter genes, which could potentially save time compared to other methods used for screening and purifying mutant viruses.

28275188	Human papillomaviruses (HPV) replicate their genomes in differentiating epithelium using the viral proteins E1 and E2 in association with host proteins. While the roles of E1 and E2 in this process are understood, the host factors involved and how they interact with and regulate E1-E2 are not. Our previous work identified the host replication and repair factor TopBP1 as an E2 partner protein essential for optimal E1-E2 replication and for the viral life cycle. The role of TopBP1 in host DNA replication is regulated by the class III deacetylase SIRT1; activation of the DNA damage response prevents SIRT1 deacetylation of TopBP1, resulting in a switch from DNA replication to repair functions for this protein and cell cycle arrest. Others have demonstrated an essential role for SIRT1 in regulation of the HPV31 life cycle; here, we report that SIRT1 can directly regulate HPV16 E1-E2-mediated DNA replication. SIRT1 is part of the E1-E2 DNA replication complex and is recruited to the viral origin of replication in an E1-E2-dependent manner. CRISPR/Cas9 was used to generate C33a clones with undetectable SIRT1 expression and lack of SIRT1 elevated E1-E2 DNA replication, in part due to increased acetylation and stabilization of the E2 protein in the absence of SIRT1. The results demonstrate that SIRT1 is a member of, and can regulate, the HPV16 replication complex. We discuss the potential role of this protein in the viral life cycle.IMPORTANCE HPV are causative agents in a number of human diseases, and currently only the symptoms of these diseases are treated. To identify novel therapeutic approaches for combating these diseases, the viral life cycle must be understood in more detail. This report demonstrates that a cellular enzyme, SIRT1, is part of the HPV16 DNA replication complex and is brought to the viral genome by the viral proteins E1 and E2. Using gene editing technology (CRISPR/Cas9), the SIRT1 gene was removed from cervical cancer cells. The consequence of this was that viral replication was elevated, probably due to a stabilization of the viral replication factor E2. The overall results demonstrate that an enzyme with known inhibitors, SIRT1, plays an important role in controlling how HPV16 makes copies of itself. Targeting this enzyme could be a new therapeutic approach for combating HPV spread and disease.	D Das|N Smith|X Wang|IM Morgan
28272984	Genome editing technologies, such as transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) and the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein (Cas) systems, can induce DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) at the targeted genomic locus, leading to frameshift-mediated gene disruption in the process of DSB repair. Recently, the technology-induced DSBs followed by DSB repairs are applied to integrate exogenous genes into the targeted genomic locus in various model organisms. In addition to a conventional knock-in technology mediated by homology-directed repair (HDR), novel knock-in technologies using refined donor vectors have also been developed with the genome editing technologies based on other DSB repair mechanisms, including non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ). Therefore, the improved knock-in technologies would contribute to freely modify the genome of model organisms.	H Morita|K Taimatsu|K Yanagi|A Kawahara
28271571	What is the topic of this review? This review concerns current gene editing strategies for blistering skin diseases with respect to individual genetic constellations and distinct conditions. What advances does it highlight? Specificity and safety dominate the discussion of gene editing applications for gene therapy, where a number of tools are implemented. Recent developments in this rapidly progressing field pose further questions regarding which tool is best suited for each particular use. The current treatment of inherited blistering skin diseases, such as epidermolysis bullosa (EB), is largely restricted to wound care and pain management. More effective therapeutic strategies are urgently required, and targeting the genetic basis of these severe diseases is now within reach. Here, we describe current gene editing tools and their potential to correct gene function in monogenetic blistering skin diseases. We present the features of the most frequently used gene editing techniques, transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9), determining their preferential application for specific genetic conditions, including the type of mutational inheritance, the targeting site within the gene or the possibility to target the mutation specifically. Both tools have traits beneficial in specific situations. Promising developments in the field engender gene editing as a potentially powerful therapeutic option for future clinical applications.

28264992	Pathogenicity islands (PAIs) are mobile integrated genetic elements that contain a diverse range of virulence factors. PAIs integrate into the host chromosome at a tRNA locus that contains their specific bacterial attachment site, attB, via integrase-mediated site-specific recombination generating attL and attR sites. We identified conserved recombination modules (integrases and att sites) previously described in choleragenic Vibrio cholerae PAIs but with novel cargo genes. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-associated proteins (Cas proteins) and a type VI secretion system (T6SS) gene cluster were identified at the Vibrio pathogenicity island 1 (VPI-1) insertion site in 19 V. cholerae strains and contained the same recombination module. Two divergent type I-F CRISPR-Cas systems were identified, which differed in Cas protein homology and content. The CRISPR repeat sequence was identical among all V. cholerae strains, but the CRISPR spacer sequences and the number of spacers varied. In silico analysis suggests that the CRISPR-Cas systems were active against phages and plasmids. A type III secretion system (T3SS) was present in 12 V. cholerae strains on a 68-kb island inserted at the same tRNA-serine insertion site as VPI-2 and contained the same recombination module. Bioinformatics analysis showed that two divergent T3SSs exist among the strains examined. Both the CRISPR and T3SS islands excised site specifically from the bacterial chromosome as complete units, and the cognate integrases were essential for this excision. These data demonstrated that identical recombination modules that catalyze integration and excision from the chromosome can acquire diverse cargo genes, signifying a novel method of acquisition for both CRISPR-Cas systems and T3SSs.IMPORTANCE This work demonstrated the presence of CRISPR-Cas systems and T3SSs on PAIs. Our work showed that similar recombination modules can associate with different cargo genes and catalyze their incorporation into bacterial chromosomes, which could convert a strain into a pathogen with very different disease pathologies. Each island had the ability to excise from the chromosome as distinct, complete units for possible transfer. Evolutionary analysis of these regions indicates that they were acquired by horizontal transfer and that PAIs are the units of transfer. Similar to the case for phage evolution, PAIs have a modular structure where different functional regions are acquired by identical recombination modules.

28264583	Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is characterized by defects in the production of microbicidal reactive oxygen species (ROS) by phagocytes. Testing of gene and cell therapies for the treatment of CGD in human hematopoietic cells requires preclinical transplant models. The use of the lymphocyte-deficient NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG) mouse strain for human hematopoietic cell xenografts to test CGD therapies is complicated by the presence of functional mouse granulocytes capable of producing ROS for subsequent bacterial and fungal killing. To establish a phagocyte-defective mouse model of X-linked CGD (X-CGD) in NSG mice, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 was utilized for targeted knockout of mouse Cybb on the X-chromosome by microinjection of NSG mouse zygotes with Cas9 mRNA and CRISPR single-guide RNA targeting Cybb exon 1 or exon 3. This resulted in a high incidence of indel formation at the CRISPR target site, with all mice exhibiting deletions in at least one Cybb allele based on sequence analysis of tail snip DNA. A female mouse heterozygous for a 235-bp deletion in Cybb exon 1 was bred to an NSG male to establish the X-CGD NSG mouse strain, NSG.Cybb[KO]. Resulting male offspring with the 235 bp deletion were found to be defective for production of ROS by neutrophils and other phagocytes, and demonstrated increased susceptibility to spontaneous bacterial and fungal infections with granulomatous inflammation. The establishment of the phagocyte-defective NSG.Cybb[KO] mouse model enables the in vivo assessment of gene and cell therapy strategies for treating CGD in human hematopoietic cell transplants without obfuscation by functional mouse phagocytes, and may also be useful for modeling other phagocyte disorders in humanized NSG mouse xenografts.

28262818	Three cos-type virulent Streptococcus thermophilus phages were isolated from failed mozzarella production in Uruguay. Genome analyses showed that these phages are similar to those isolated elsewhere around the world. The CRISPR1 and CRISPR3 arrays of the three S. thermophilus host strains from Uruguay were also characterized and similarities were noted with previously described model strains SMQ-301, LMD-9 and DGCC7710. Spontaneous bacteriophage-insensitive S. thermophilus mutants (BIMs) were obtained after challenging the phage-sensitive wild-type strain Uy02 with the phage 128 and their CRISPR content was analyzed. Analysis of 23 BIMs indicated that all of them had acquired at least one new spacer in their CRISPR1 array. While 14 BIMs had acquired spacer at the 5'-end of the array, 9 other BIMs acquired a spacer within the array. Comparison of the leader sequence in strains Uy02 and DGCC7710 showed a nucleotide deletion at position -1 in Uy02, which may be responsible for the observed ectopic spacer acquisition. Analysis of the spacer sequences upstream the newly acquired ectopic spacer indicated presence of a conserved adenine residue at position -2. This study indicates that natural strains of S. thermophilus can also acquire spacers within a CRISPR array.	R Achigar|AH Magadán|DM Tremblay|M Julia Pianzzola|S Moineau
28262544	Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are promising in regenerative medicine. However, the risks of teratoma formation and the overgrowth of the transplanted cells continue to be major hurdles that must be overcome. Here, we examined the efficacy of the inducible caspase-9 (iCaspase9) gene as a fail-safe against undesired tumorigenic transformation of iPSC-derived somatic cells. We used a lentiviral vector to transduce iCaspase9 into two iPSC lines and assessed its efficacy in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, the iCaspase9 system induced apoptosis in approximately 95% of both iPSCs and iPSC-derived neural stem/progenitor cells (iPSC-NS/PCs). To determine in vivo function, we transplanted iPSC-NS/PCs into the injured spinal cord of NOD/SCID mice. All transplanted cells whose mass effect was hindering motor function recovery were ablated upon transduction of iCaspase9. Our results suggest that the iCaspase9 system may serve as an important countermeasure against post-transplantation adverse events in stem cell transplant therapies.

28260338	Objective: To investigate the CRISPR genotypes (clusters) and regional distribution of Yersinia pestis in Qinghai-plateau. Methods: One hundred and two isolates of Y. pestis isolated from human plague patients, host animal and insect vectors from Qinghai-plateau were selected. The DNAs were extracted using the traditional sodium dodecyl sulfate decomposition and phenol-chloroform method. Three CRISPR loci YPa, YPb and YPc of 102 isolates of Y. pesits were amplified and sequenced, and then the CRISPR sequence analysis was carried out by comparing the latest published CRISPR spacer dictionary and the NCBI database to identify the spacer and spacer array. CRISPR genotyping of isolates of Y. pesits were finally conducted according to the polymorphism of the spacer arrays and the regional distribution pattern of isolates of Y. pesits in Qinghai-plateau was described. Results: Forty spacers including 22 of YPa, 13 of YPb and 5 of YPc were observed among 102 isolates of Y. pestis in Qinghai-plateau, of which 5 spacers (a1', a103, a104, b4'' and b4''') were firstly identified. Meanwhile, 16, 10, and 5 different spacer arrays were obtained in YPa, YPb and YPc respectively, including 11 new spacer arrays detected in this study. One hundred and two isolates were divided into 24 CRISPR genotypes and classified into 9 CRISPR clusters (Cb4, Cb4', Cb2, Ca37, Ca7, Ca7', CaΔ5', Ca35' and Cc3'). Each dominant cluster presented significant aggregation geographically: Ca7 were found in Yushu, Nangqian, Chenduo, Zaduo, Zhiduo and Qumalai countries. Ca7' were found in Xunhua, Tongren, Zeku, Tongde, Maqin and Guinan countries. CaΔ5' were restricted to Qilian, Gangcha, Menyuan and Datong countries. CaΔ35' were found in Huangyuan, Haiyan, Gangcha, Tianjun, Delingha, Wulan, Doulan, Gonghe, Xinghai, Guide and Tongde countries. Conclusion: CRISPR-based genotyping analyses showed complicated population of Y. pestis in Qinghai-plateau. Four clusters, Ca7, Ca7', CaΔ5' and Ca35' were the most epidemic dominant four clusters and presented obvious regional distribution patterns, which instructed us to strengthen the surveillance and prevention and control by CRISPR-genotyping technique.	目的：研究青海高原鼠疫耶尔森菌（鼠疫菌）的CRISPR基因型（类群）及其地区分布。 方法：选取1954—2011年间青海高原境内各县／市从人鼠疫患者、宿主动物及媒介昆虫体内分离的鼠疫菌102株，采用传统的十二烷基磺酸钠裂解和苯酚-氯仿法提取鼠疫菌DNA。分别对YPa、YPb和YPc等3个CRISPR位点进行PCR扩增、测序，然后将所测得CRISPR序列与文献最新报道的CRISPR Dictionary和NCBI数据库检索比对，以鉴定CRISPR spacer阵列。最后根据CRISPR spacer阵列的多态性对青海高原鼠疫菌进行基因分型，并描绘其地区分布特征。 结果： 102株鼠疫菌共发现40种spacer，包括YPa 22种、YPb 13种、YPc 5种，其中有5种新spacer，分别为a1'、a103、a104、b4''和b4'''； YPa、YPb和YPc分别鉴定出16、10和5种不同的spacer阵列，新发现的spacer阵列为11种。102株鼠疫菌可被分为24个基因型，共归为9大CRISPR类群，分别为Cb4、Cb4'、Cb2、Ca37、Ca7、Ca7'、CaΔ5'、 Ca35'和Cc3' ，其中Ca7、Ca7'、CaΔ5'、Ca35'呈现出显著的聚集性特征：Ca7主要分布在玉树、囊谦、称多、杂多、治多和曲麻莱；Ca7'分布于循化、同仁、泽库、同德、玛沁和贵南；CaΔ5'集中在祁连、刚察、门源、大通；Ca35'分布在湟源、海晏、刚察、天峻、德令哈、乌兰、都兰、兴海、共和和贵德。 结论：青海高原鼠疫菌CRISPR种群结构复杂，Ca7、Ca7'、CaΔ5'和Ca35'是流行最普遍的主要种群，这些种群呈现显著的地区分布特征，可以利用CRISPR分型技术加强该地区鼠疫检测和防控工作。.

28258147	Clostridium saccharoperbutylacetonicum N1-4 is well known as a hyper-butanol-producing strain. However, the lack of genetic engineering tools hinders further elucidation of its solvent production mechanism and development of more robust strains. In this study, we set out to develop an efficient genome engineering system for this microorganism based on the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated 9 (CRISPR-Cas9) system. First, the functionality of the CRISPR-Cas9 system previously customized for Clostridium beijerinckii was evaluated in C. saccharoperbutylacetonicum by targeting pta and buk, two essential genes for acetate and butyrate production, respectively. pta and buk single and double deletion mutants were successfully obtained based on this system. However, the genome engineering efficiency was rather low (the mutation rate is <20%). Therefore, the efficiency was further optimized by evaluating various promoters for guide RNA (gRNA) expression. With promoter P J23119 , we achieved a mutation rate of 75% for pta deletion without serial subculturing as suggested previously for C. beijerinckii Thus, this developed CRISPR-Cas9 system is highly desirable for efficient genome editing in C. saccharoperbutylacetonicum Batch fermentation results revealed that both the acid and solvent production profiles were altered due to the disruption of acid production pathways; however, neither acetate nor butyrate production was eliminated with the deletion of the corresponding gene. The butanol production, yield, and selectivity were improved in mutants, depending on the fermentation medium. In the pta buk double deletion mutant, the butanol production in P2 medium reached 19.0 g/liter, which is one of the highest levels ever reported from batch fermentations.IMPORTANCE An efficient CRISPR-Cas9 genome engineering system was developed for C. saccharoperbutylacetonicum N1-4. This paves the way for elucidating the solvent production mechanism in this hyper-butanol-producing microorganism and developing strains with desirable butanol-producing features. This tool can be easily adapted for use in closely related microorganisms. As also reported by others, here we demonstrated with solid data that the highly efficient expression of gRNA is the key factor determining the efficiency of CRISPR-Cas9 for genome editing. The protocol developed in this study can provide essential references for other researchers who work in the areas of metabolic engineering and synthetic biology. The developed mutants can be used as excellent starting strains for development of more robust ones for desirable solvent production.	S Wang|S Dong|P Wang|Y Tao|Y Wang
28256578	CRISPR-based transcription regulators (CRISPR-TRs) have transformed the current synthetic biology landscape by allowing specific activation or repression of any target gene. Here we report a modular and versatile framework enabling rapid implementation of inducible CRISPR-TRs in mammalian cells. This strategy relies on the design of a spacer-blocking hairpin (SBH) structure at the 5' end of the single guide RNA (sgRNA), which abrogates the function of CRISPR-transcriptional activators. By replacing the SBH loop with ligand-controlled RNA-cleaving units, we demonstrate conditional activation of quiescent sgRNAs programmed to respond to genetically encoded or externally delivered triggers. We use this system to couple multiple synthetic and endogenous target genes with specific inducers, and assemble gene regulatory modules demonstrating parallel and orthogonal transcriptional programs. We anticipate that this 'plug and play' approach will be a valuable addition to the synthetic biology toolkit, facilitating the understanding of natural gene circuits and the design of cell-based therapeutic strategies.

28254804	Genetic engineering of model organisms and cultured cells has for decades provided important insights into the mechanisms underlying cardiovascular development and disease. In the past few years the development of several nuclease systems has broadened the range of model/cell systems that can be engineered. Of these, the CRISPR (clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeats)/Cas9 (CRISPR-associated protein 9) system has become the favorite for its ease of application. Here we will review this RNA-guided nuclease system for gene editing with respect to its usefulness for cardiovascular studies and with an eye toward potential therapy. Studies on its off-target activity, along with approaches to minimize this activity will be given. The advantages of gene editing versus gene targeting in embryonic stem cells, including the breadth of species and cell types to which it is applicable, will be discussed. We will also cover its use in iPSC for research and possible therapeutic purposes; and we will review its use in muscular dystrophy studies where considerable progress has been made toward dystrophin correction in mice. The CRISPR/Ca9s system is also being used for high-throughput screening of genes, gene regulatory regions, and long noncoding RNAs. In addition, the CRISPR system is being used for nongene-editing purposes such as activation and inhibition of gene expression, as well as for fluorescence tagging of chromosomal regions and individual mRNAs to track their cellular location. Finally, an approach to circumvent the inability of post-mitotic cells to support homologous recombination-based gene editing will be presented. In conclusion, applications of the CRISPR/Cas system are expanding at a breath-taking pace and are revolutionizing approaches to gain a better understanding of human diseases.

28251462	Archaea represents the third domain of life, with the information-processing machineries more closely resembling those of eukaryotes than the machineries of the bacterial counterparts but sharing metabolic pathways with organisms of Bacteria, the sister prokaryotic phylum. Archaeal organisms also possess unique features as revealed by genomics and genome comparisons and by biochemical characterization of prominent enzymes. Nevertheless, diverse genetic tools are required for in vivo experiments to verify these interesting discoveries. Considerable efforts have been devoted to the development of genetic tools for archaea ever since their discovery, and great progress has been made in the creation of archaeal genetic tools in the past decade. Versatile genetic toolboxes are now available for several archaeal models, among which Sulfolobus microorganisms are the only genus representing Crenarchaeota because all the remaining genera are from Euryarchaeota. Nevertheless, genetic tools developed for Sulfolobus are probably the most versatile among all archaeal models, and these include viral and plasmid shuttle vectors, conventional and novel genetic manipulation methods, CRISPR-based gene deletion and mutagenesis, and gene silencing, among which CRISPR tools have been reported only for Sulfolobus thus far. In this review, we summarize recent developments in all these useful genetic tools and discuss their possible application to research into archaeal biology by means of Sulfolobus models.

28251317	Previous works using human tripronuclear zygotes suggested that the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9 system could be a tool in correcting disease-causing mutations. However, whether this system was applicable in normal human (dual pronuclear, 2PN) zygotes was unclear. Here we demonstrate that CRISPR/Cas9 is also effective as a gene-editing tool in human 2PN zygotes. By injection of Cas9 protein complexed with the appropriate sgRNAs and homology donors into one-cell human embryos, we demonstrated efficient homologous recombination-mediated correction of point mutations in HBB and G6PD. However, our results also reveal limitations of this correction procedure and highlight the need for further research.	L Tang|Y Zeng|H Du|M Gong|J Peng|B Zhang|M Lei|F Zhao|W Wang|X Li|J Liu
28250269	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9-mediated genome engineering technology is a powerful tool for generation of cells and animals with engineered mutations in their genomes. In order to introduce the CRISPR/Cas9 system into target cells, nonviral and viral vectors are often used; however, such vectors trigger innate immune responses associated with production of type I interferons (IFNs). We have recently demonstrated that type I IFNs inhibit short-hairpin RNA-mediated gene silencing, which led us to hypothesize that type I IFNs may also inhibit CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome mutagenesis. Here we investigated this hypothesis. A single-strand annealing assay using a reporter plasmid demonstrated that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated cleavage efficiencies of the target double-stranded DNA were significantly reduced by IFNα. A mismatch recognition nuclease-dependent genotyping assay also demonstrated that IFNα reduced insertion or deletion (indel) mutation levels by approximately half. Treatment with IFNα did not alter Cas9 protein expression levels, whereas the copy numbers of guide RNA (gRNA) were significantly reduced by IFNα stimulation. These results indicate that type I IFNs significantly reduce gRNA expression levels following introduction of the CRISPR/Cas9 system in the cells, leading to a reduction in the efficiencies of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome mutagenesis. Our findings provide important clues for the achievement of efficient genome engineering using the CRISPR/Cas9 system.

28247934	Since the dawn of life there is a never ending strife between bacteria and phages. Both are perpetually changing their strategies to take over each other. CRISPR/Cas is the most widespread defense system used by bacteria against mobile genetic elements (MGEs) such as phages, cojugative palsmids, transoposons, and pathogenicity islands. This system utilizes small guide RNA molecules to protect against phages infection and invasion by MGEs. Phages circumvent to these antiviral barriers by point mutation in PAM (protospacer-adjacent motif) sequence, genome rearrangements and by using anti-CRISPR proteins.

28244995	Base editors (BEs) composed of a cytidine deaminase fused to CRISPR-Cas9 convert cytidine to uridine, leading to single-base-pair substitutions in eukaryotic cells. We delivered BE mRNA or ribonucleoproteins targeting the Dmd or Tyr gene via electroporation or microinjection into mouse zygotes. F0 mice showed nonsense mutations with an efficiency of 44-57% and allelic frequencies of up to 100%, demonstrating an efficient method to generate mice with targeted point mutations.

28242812	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States, whereas colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer. The RNA-binding protein HuR (ELAVL1) supports a pro-oncogenic network in gastrointestinal (GI) cancer cells through enhanced HuR expression. Using a publically available database, HuR expression levels were determined to be increased in primary PDA and colorectal cancer tumor cohorts as compared with normal pancreas and colon tissues, respectively. CRISPR/Cas9 technology was successfully used to delete the HuR gene in both PDA (MIA PaCa-2 and Hs 766T) and colorectal cancer (HCT116) cell lines. HuR deficiency has a mild phenotype, in vitro, as HuR-deficient MIA PaCa-2 (MIA.HuR-KO(-/-)) cells had increased apoptosis when compared with isogenic wild-type (MIA.HuR-WT(+/+)) cells. Using this isogenic system, mRNAs were identified that specifically bound to HuR and were required for transforming a two-dimensional culture into three dimensional (i.e., organoids). Importantly, HuR-deficient MIA PaCa-2 and Hs 766T cells were unable to engraft tumors in vivo compared with control HuR-proficient cells, demonstrating a unique xenograft lethal phenotype. Although not as a dramatic phenotype, CRISPR knockout HuR HCT116 colon cancer cells (HCT.HuR-KO(-/-)) showed significantly reduced in vivo tumor growth compared with controls (HCT.HuR-WT(+/+)). Finally, HuR deletion affects KRAS activity and controls a subset of pro-oncogenic genes.Implications: The work reported here supports the notion that targeting HuR is a promising therapeutic strategy to treat GI malignancies.

28241310	Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) plays a key role in VEGF-induced angiogenesis. The goal of this project was to test the hypothesis that editing genomic VEGFR2 loci using the technology of clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated DNA endonuclease (Cas)9 in Streptococcus pyogenes (SpCas9) was able to block VEGF-induced activation of Akt and tube formation.	Four 20 nucleotides for synthesizing single-guide RNAs based on human genomic VEGFR2 exon 3 loci were selected and cloned into a lentiCRISPR v2 vector, respectively. The DNA fragments from the genomic VEGFR2 exon 3 of transduced primary human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRECs) were analyzed by Sanger DNA sequencing, surveyor nuclease assay, and next-generation sequencing (NGS). In the transduced cells, expression of VEGFR2 and VEGF-stimulated signaling events (e.g., Akt phosphorylation) were determined by Western blot analyses; VEGF-induced cellular responses (proliferation, migration, and tube formation) were examined.	In the VEGFR2-sgRNA/SpCas9-transduced HRECs, Sanger DNA sequencing indicated that there were mutations, and NGS demonstrated that there were 83.57% insertion and deletions in the genomic VEGFR2 locus; expression of VEGFR2 was depleted in the VEGFR2-sgRNA/SpCas9-transduced HRECs. In addition, there were lower levels of Akt phosphorylation in HRECs with VEGFR2-sgRNA/SpCas9 than those with LacZ-sgRNA/SpCas9, and there was less VEGF-stimulated Akt activation, proliferation, migration, or tube formation in the VEGFR2-depleted HRECs than those treated with aflibercept or ranibizumab.	The CRISPR-SpCas9 technology is a potential novel approach to prevention of pathologic angiogenesis.	X Huang|G Zhou|W Wu|G Ma|PA D'Amore|S Mukai|H Lei
28238733	CRISPR arrays are transcribed into long precursor RNA species, which are further processed into mature CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs). Cas proteins utilize these crRNAs, which contain spacer sequences that can be derived from mobile genetic elements, to mediate immunity during a reoccurring virus infection. Type I CRISPR-Cas systems are defined by the presence of different Cascade interference complexes containing large and small subunits that play major roles during target DNA selection.	Here, we produce the protein and crRNA components of the Type I-B CRISPR-Cas complex of Clostridium thermocellum and Methanococcus maripaludis. The C. thermocellum Cascade complexes were reconstituted and analyzed via size-exclusion chromatography. Activity of the heterologous M. maripaludis CRISPR-Cas system was followed using phage lambda plaques assays.	The reconstituted Type-I-B Cascade complex contains Cas7, Cas5, Cas6b and the large subunit Cas8b. Cas6b can be omitted from the reconstitution protocol. The large subunit Cas8b was found to be represented by two tightly associated protein fragments and a small C-terminal Cas8b segment was identified in recombinant complexes and C. thermocellum cell lysate.	Production of Cas8b generates a small C-terminal fragment, which is suggested to fulfill the role of the missing small subunit. A heterologous, synthetic M. maripaludis Type I-B system is active in E. coli against phage lambda, highlighting a potential for genome editing using endogenous Type-I-B CRISPR-Cas machineries.

28237120	The ability to efficiently modulate autophagy activity is paramount in the study of the field. Conventional broad-range autophagy inhibitors and genetic manipulation using RNA interference (RNAi), although widely used in autophagy research, are often limited in specificity or efficacy. In this chapter, we address the problems of conventional autophagy-modulating tools by exploring the use of three different CRISPR/Cas9 systems to abrogate autophagy in numerous human and mouse cell lines. The first system generates cell lines constitutively deleted of ATG5 or ATG7 whereas the second and third systems express a Tet-On inducible-Cas9 that enables regulated deletion of ATG5 or ATG7. We observed the efficiency of autophagy inhibition using the CRISPR/Cas9 strategy to surpass that of RNAi, and successfully generated cells with complete and sustained autophagy disruption through the CRISPR/Cas9 technology.

28231673	Objective: To explore the stability of resistant phenotypes and changes of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) gene system on four Shigella strains in the absence of antibiotics. Methods: Four clinical isolated Shigella strains that resistant to different antibiotics were consecutive passaged for 90 times without antibiotics. Agar dilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration of Shigella strains. After sequence analysis with PCR, CRISPR Finder and Clustal X 2.1 were applied to identify the changes of CRISPR loci in the Shigella strains. Results: After the consecutive transfer of 90 generations, sensitivity to certain antibiotics of four Shigella strains with different drug resistant spectrums increased. Mel-sf1998024/zz resistance to ampicillin, cephalexin, cefotaxime, chloramphenicol decreased, mel-s2014026/sx resistance to norfloxacin, trimethoprim decreased, mel-sf2004004/sx drug resistance to ampicillin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim decreased and mel-sf2013004/bj resistance to chloramphenicol decreased. The spacer of which matched gene codes Cas and its upstream repeat in 3'end of CRISPR3 got lost in mel-sf1998024/zz and mel-sf2013004/bj. Conclusions:Shigella strains could reduce or lose their resistance to some antibiotics after consecutive transfers, without the interference of antibiotics. CRISPR3 locus had dynamic spacers in Shigella strains while CRISPR3 locus and cas genes might have been co-evolved.	目的：分析无抗生素压力下连续传代90次的4株志贺菌耐药表型及成簇规律间隔短回文重复序列（CRISPR ）/CRISPR相关蛋白（Cas）基因变化。 方法：对临床分离的4株耐药谱不同的志贺菌进行无抗生素压力连续传代90次，传代结束后用琼脂稀释法检测传代前、后志贺菌最小抑菌浓度；用PCR对CRISPR位点进行扩增并测序，CRISPR Finder和Clustal X 2.1分析CRISPR位点的变化。 结果：经无抗生素压力传代90次后，4株志贺菌对某些抗生素的敏感性有不同程度的增加：mel-sf1998024/zz对氨苄西林、头孢氨苄、头孢噻肟、氯霉素的耐药性降低，mel-s2014026/sx对诺氟沙星、甲氧苄啶的耐药性降低，mel-sf2004004/sx对氨苄西林、头孢呋辛、头孢噻肟、氯霉素、甲氧苄啶的耐药性降低，mel-sf2013004/bj对氯霉素的耐药性降低；志贺菌mel-sf1998024/zz和mel-sf2013004/bj经无抗生素压力传代后，CRISPR3位点3'的重复-间隔序列丢失，其中间隔序列匹配基因的编码产物是Cas蛋白。 结论：志贺菌在无抗生素压力下，可降低或丢失对某些抗生素的耐药性。部分志贺菌CRISPR3位点的结构发生了变化，CRISPR3位点与cas基因可能存在共进化。.

28231254	Genetic alterations conferring resistance to the effects of chemical inhibitors are valuable tools for validating on-target effects in cells. Unfortunately, for many therapeutic targets such alleles are not available. To address this issue, we evaluated whether CRISPR-Cas9-mediated insertion/deletion (indel) mutagenesis can produce drug-resistance alleles at endogenous loci. This method takes advantage of the heterogeneous in-frame alleles produced following Cas9-mediated DNA cleavage, which we show can generate rare alleles that confer resistance to the growth-arrest caused by chemical inhibitors. We used this approach to identify novel resistance alleles of two lysine methyltransferases, DOT1L and EZH2, which are each essential for the growth of MLL-fusion leukemia cells. We biochemically characterized the DOT1L mutation, showing that it is significantly more active than the wild-type enzyme. These findings validate the on-target anti-leukemia activities of existing DOT1L and EZH2 inhibitors and reveal a simple method for deriving drug-resistance alleles for novel targets, which may have utility during early stages of drug development.

28220462	The opportunities afforded through the recent advent of genome-editing technologies have allowed investigators to more easily study a number of diseases. The advantages and limitations of the most prominent genome-editing technologies are described in this review, along with potential applications specifically focused on cardiovascular diseases.	The recent genome-editing tools using programmable nucleases, such as zinc-finger nucleases, transcription activator-like effector nucleases, and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated 9 (Cas9), have rapidly been adapted to manipulate genes in a variety of cellular and animal models. A number of recent cardiovascular disease-related publications report cases in which specific mutations are introduced into disease models for functional characterization and for testing of therapeutic strategies. Recent advances in genome-editing technologies offer new approaches to understand and treat diseases. Here, we discuss genome editing strategies to easily characterize naturally occurring mutations and offer strategies with potential clinical relevance.	AC Chadwick|K Musunuru
28216107	Saponins are a structurally diverse family of triterpenes that are widely found as main constituents in many traditional plant-based medicines and often have bioactivities of industrial interest. The heterologous production of triterpene saponins in microbes remains challenging and only limited successful pathway engineering endeavors have been reported. To improve the production capacities of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae saponin production platform, we assessed the effects of several hitherto unexplored gene knockout targets on the heterologous production of triterpenoids. Here, we show that the disruption of the phosphatidic acid phosphatase-encoding PAH1 through CRISPR/Cas9 results in a dramatic expansion of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which stimulated the production of recombinant triterpene biosynthesis enzymes and ultimately boosted triterpenoid and triterpene saponin accumulation. Compared to the wild-type starter strain, accumulation of the oleanane-type sapogenin β-amyrin, of its oxidized derivative medicagenic acid, and its glucosylated version medicagenic-28-O-glucoside was respectively increased by eight-, six- and 16-fold in the pah1 strain. A positive effect of pah1 could also be observed for the production of other terpenoids depending on ER-associated enzymes for their biosynthesis, such as the sesquiterpenoid artemisinic acid, which increased by twofold relative to the wild-type strain. Hence, this report demonstrates that pathway engineering in yeast through transforming the subcellular morphology rather than altering metabolic fluxes is a powerful strategy to increase yields of bioactive plant-derived products in heterologous hosts.

28215090	The overuse of antibiotics plays a major role in the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant bacteria. A molecularly targeted, specific treatment method for bacterial pathogens can prevent this problem by reducing the selective pressure during microbial growth. Herein, we introduce a nonviral treatment strategy delivering genome editing material for targeting antibacterial resistance. We apply the CRISPR-Cas9 system, which has been recognized as an innovative tool for highly specific and efficient genome engineering in different organisms, as the delivery cargo. We utilize polymer-derivatized Cas9, by direct covalent modification of the protein with cationic polymer, for subsequent complexation with single-guide RNA targeting antibiotic resistance. We show that nanosized CRISPR complexes (= Cr-Nanocomplex) were successfully formed, while maintaining the functional activity of Cas9 endonuclease to induce double-strand DNA cleavage. We also demonstrate that the Cr-Nanocomplex designed to target mecA-the major gene involved in methicillin resistance-can be efficiently delivered into Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and allow the editing of the bacterial genome with much higher efficiency compared to using native Cas9 complexes or conventional lipid-based formulations. The present study shows for the first time that a covalently modified CRISPR system allows nonviral, therapeutic genome editing, and can be potentially applied as a target specific antimicrobial.

28214735	Clostridium difficile (CD)-associated diarrhoea is currently the most prevalent nosocomial diarrhoea worldwide. Many characteristics of CD pathogenicity remain poorly understood. Recent data strongly indicate the importance of an RNA network for the control of gene expression in CD. More than 200 regulatory RNAs have been identified by deep sequencing and targeted approaches, including Hfq-dependent trans riboregulators, cis-antisense RNAs, CRISPR RNAs, and c-di-GMP-responsive riboswitches. These regulatory RNAs are involved in the control of major processes in the CD infection cycle, for example motility, biofilm formation, adhesion, sporulation, stress response, and defence against bacteriophages. We will discuss recent advances in elucidation of the original features of RNA-based mechanisms in this important enteropathogen. This knowledge may pave the way for further discoveries in this emergent field.	O Soutourina

28211909	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cpf1 has emerged as an effective genome editing tool in animals. Here we compare the activity of Cpf1 from Acidaminococcus sp. BV3L6 (As) and Lachnospiraceae bacterium ND2006 (Lb) in plants, using a dual RNA polymerase II promoter expression system. LbCpf1 generated biallelic mutations at nearly 100% efficiency at four independent sites in rice T0 transgenic plants. Moreover, we repurposed AsCpf1 and LbCpf1 for efficient transcriptional repression in Arabidopsis, and demonstrated a more than tenfold reduction in miR159b transcription. Our data suggest promising applications of CRISPR-Cpf1 for editing plant genomes and modulating the plant transcriptome.

28209967	Microinjection of the CRISPR/Cas9 system in zygotes is an efficient and comparatively fast method to generate genetically modified mice. So far, only few knock-in mice have been generated using this approach, and because no systematic study has been performed, parameters controlling the efficacy of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated targeted insertion are not fully established. Here, we evaluated the effect of several parameters on knock-in efficiency changing only one variable at a time. We found that knock-in efficiency was dependent on injected Cas9 mRNA and single-guide RNA concentrations and that cytoplasmic injection resulted in more genotypic complexity compared to pronuclear injection. Our results also indicated that injection into the pronucleus compared to the cytoplasm is preferable to generate knock-in alleles with an oligonucleotide or a circular plasmid. Finally, we showed that Cas9D10A nickase variant was less efficient than wild-type Cas9 for generating knock-in alleles and caused a higher rate of mosaicism. Thus, our study provides valuable information that will help to improve the future production of precise genetic modifications in mice.	A Raveux|S Vandormael-Pournin|M Cohen-Tannoudji

28205546	Cpf1, a type V CRISPR effector, recognizes a thymidine-rich protospacer-adjacent motif and induces cohesive double-stranded breaks at the target site guided by a single CRISPR RNA (crRNA). Here we show that Cpf1 can be used as a tool for DNA-free editing of plant genomes. We describe the delivery of recombinant Cpf1 proteins with in vitro transcribed or chemically synthesized target-specific crRNAs into protoplasts isolated from soybean and wild tobacco. Designed crRNAs are unique and do not have similar sequences (≤3 mismatches) in the entire soybean reference genome. Targeted deep sequencing analyses show that mutations are successfully induced in FAD2 paralogues in soybean and AOC in wild tobacco. Unlike SpCas9, Cpf1 mainly induces various nucleotide deletions at target sites. No significant mutations are detected at potential off-target sites in the soybean genome. These results demonstrate that Cpf1-crRNA complex is an effective DNA-free genome-editing tool for plant genome editing.	H Kim|ST Kim|J Ryu|BC Kang|JS Kim|SG Kim
28204574	During primed CRISPR adaptation spacers are preferentially selected from DNA recognized by CRISPR interference machinery, which in the case of Type I CRISPR-Cas systems consists of CRISPR RNA (crRNA) bound effector Cascade complex that locates complementary targets, and Cas3 executor nuclease/helicase. A complex of Cas1 and Cas2 proteins is capable of inserting new spacers in the CRISPR array. Here, we show that in Escherichia coli cells undergoing primed adaptation, spacer-sized fragments of foreign DNA are associated with Cas1. Based on sensitivity to digestion with nucleases, the associated DNA is not in a standard double-stranded state. Spacer-sized fragments are cut from one strand of foreign DNA in Cas1- and Cas3-dependent manner. These fragments are generated from much longer S1-nuclease sensitive fragments of foreign DNA that require Cas3 for their production. We propose that in the course of CRISPR interference Cas3 generates fragments of foreign DNA that are recognized by the Cas1-Cas2 adaptation complex, which excises spacer-sized fragments and channels them for insertion into CRISPR array.

28202911	CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology has taken the research world by storm since its use in eukaryotes was first proposed in 2012. Publications describing advances in technology and new applications have continued at an unrelenting pace since that time. In this Review, we discuss the application of CRISPR/Cas9 for creating gene mutations - the application that initiated the current avalanche of interest - and new developments that have largely answered initial concerns about its specificity and ability to introduce new gene sequences. We discuss the new, diverse and rapidly growing adaptations of the CRISPR/Cas9 technique that enable activation, repression, multiplexing and gene screening. These developments have enabled researchers to create sophisticated tools for dissecting the function and inter-relatedness of genes, as well as noncoding regions of the genome, and to identify gene networks and noncoding regions that promote disease or confer disease susceptibility. These approaches are beginning to be used to interrogate complex and multilayered biological systems and to produce complex animal models of disease. CRISPR/Cas9 technology has enabled the application of new therapeutic approaches to treating disease in animal models, some of which are beginning to be seen in the first human clinical trials. We discuss the direct application of these techniques to rheumatic diseases, which are currently limited but are sure to increase rapidly in the near future.	GJ Gibson|M Yang
28202591	CRISPR is a newly discovered prokaryotic immune system. Bacteria and archaea with this system incorporate genetic material from invading viruses into their genomes, providing protection against future infection by similar viruses. The condition for coexistence of prokaryots and viruses is an interesting problem in evolutionary biology. In this work, we show an intriguing phase diagram of the virus extinction probability, which is more complex than that of the classical predator-prey model. As the CRISPR incorporates genetic material, viruses are under pressure to evolve to escape recognition by CRISPR. When bacteria have a small rate of deleting spacers, a new parameter region in which bacteria and viruses can coexist arises, and it leads to a more complex coexistence patten for bacteria and viruses. For example, when the virus mutation rate is low, the virus extinction probability changes non-montonically with the bacterial exposure rate. The virus and bacteria coevolution not only alters the virus extinction probability, but also changes the bacterial population structure. Additionally, we show that recombination is a successful strategy for viruses to escape from CRISPR recognition when viruses have multiple proto-spacers, providing support for a recombination-mediated escape mechanism suggested experimentally. Finally, we suggest that the re-entrant phase diagram, in which phages can progress through three phases of extinction and two phases of abundance at low spacer deletion rates as a function of exposure rate to bacteria, is an experimentally testable phenomenon.

28202515	Chromatin-modifying genes are frequently mutated in human lung adenocarcinoma, but the functional impact of these mutations on disease initiation and progression is not well understood. Using a CRISPR-based approach, we systematically inactivated three of the most commonly mutated chromatin regulatory genes in two KrasG12D-driven mouse models of lung adenocarcinoma to characterize the impact of their loss. Targeted inactivation of SWI/SNF nucleosome-remodeling complex members Smarca4 (Brg1) or Arid1a had complex effects on lung adenocarcinoma initiation and progression. Loss of either Brg1 or Arid1a were selected against in early-stage tumors, but Brg1 loss continued to limit disease progression over time, whereas loss of Arid1a eventually promoted development of higher grade lesions. In contrast to these stage-specific effects, loss of the histone methyltransferase Setd2 had robust tumor-promoting consequences. Despite disparate impacts of Setd2 and Arid1a loss on tumor development, each resulted in a gene expression profile with significant overlap. Setd2 inactivation and subsequent loss of H3K36me3 led to the swift expansion and accelerated progression of both early- and late-stage tumors. However, Setd2 loss per se was insufficient to overcome a p53-regulated barrier to malignant progression, nor establish the prometastatic cellular states that stochastically evolve during lung adenocarcinoma progression. Our study uncovers differential and context-dependent effects of SWI/SNF complex member loss, identifies Setd2 as a potent tumor suppressor in lung adenocarcinoma, and establishes model systems to facilitate further study of chromatin deregulation in lung cancer.

28201993	CRISPR and CRISPR-flanking genomic regions are important for molecular epidemiology of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) strains, and potentially for adaptive immunity to phage and plasmid DNA, and endogenous roles in the bacterium. Genotyping in the Israel National Mycobacterium Reference Center Tel-Aviv of over 1500 MTBC strains from 2008-2013 showed three strains with validated negative 43-spacer spoligotypes, that is, with putatively deleted direct repeat regions (deleted-DR/CRISPR regions). Two isolates of each of three negative spoligotype MTBC (a total of 6 isolates) were subjected to Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). As positive controls, NGS was performed for three intact-DR isolates belonging to T3_Eth, the largest multiple-drug-resistant (MDR)-containing African-origin cluster in Israel. Other controls consisted of NGS reads and complete whole genome sequences from GenBank for 20 intact-DR MTBC and for 1 deleted-DR MTBC strain recognized as CAS by its defining RD deletion.	NGS reads from negative spoligotype MTBC mapped to reference H37Rv NC_000962.3 suggested that the DR/CRISPR regions were completely deleted except for retention of the middle IS6110 mobile element. Clonally specific deletion of CRISPR-flanking genes also was observed, including deletion of at least cas2 and cas1 genes. Genomic RD deletions defined lineages corresponding to the major spoligotype families Beijing, EAI, and Haarlem, consistent with 24 loci MIRU-VNTR profiles. Analysis of NGS reads, and analysis of contigs obtained by manual PCR confirmed that all 43 gold standard DR/CRISPR spacers were missing in the deleted-DR genomes.	Although many negative spoligotype strains are recorded as spoligotype-international-type (SIT) 2669 in the SITVIT international database, this is the first time to our knowledge that it has been shown that negative spoligotype strains are found in at least 4 different 24 loci MIRU-VNTR and RD deletion families. We report for the first time negative spoligotype-associated total loss of CRISPR region spacers and repeats, with accompanying clonally specific loss of flanking genes, including at least CRISPR-associated genes cas2 and cas1. Since cas1 deleted E.coli shows increased sensitivity to DNA damage and impaired chromosomal segregation, we discussed the possibility of a similar phenotype in the deleted-DR strains and Beijing family strains as both lack the cas1 gene.

28196870	The type II bacterial CRISPR/Cas9 system is a simple, convenient, and powerful tool for targeted gene editing. Here, we describe a CRISPR/Cas9-based approach for inserting a poly(A) transcriptional terminator into both alleles of a targeted gene to silence protein-coding and non-protein-coding genes, which often play key roles in gene regulation but are difficult to silence via insertion or deletion of short DNA fragments. The integration of 225 bp of bovine growth hormone poly(A) signals into either the first intron or the first exon or behind the promoter of target genes caused efficient termination of expression of PPP1R12C, NSUN2 (protein-coding genes), and MALAT1 (non-protein-coding gene). Both NeoR and PuroR were used as markers in the selection of clonal cell lines with biallelic integration of a poly(A) signal. Genotyping analysis indicated that the cell lines displayed the desired biallelic silencing after a brief selection period. These combined results indicate that this CRISPR/Cas9-based approach offers an easy, convenient, and efficient novel technique for gene silencing in cell lines, especially for those in which gene integration is difficult because of a low efficiency of homology-directed repair.

28196864	The Ebola virus (EBOV) trimeric envelope glycoprotein (GP) precursors are cleaved into the receptor-binding GP1 and the fusion-mediating GP2 subunits and incorporated into virions to initiate infection. GP1 and GP2 form heterodimers that have 15 or two N-glycosylation sites (NGSs), respectively. Here we investigated the mechanism of how N-glycosylation contributes to GP expression, maturation, and function. As reported before, we found that, although GP1 NGSs are not critical, the two GP2 NGSs, Asn563 and Asn618, are essential for GP function. Further analysis uncovered that Asn563 and Asn618 regulate GP processing, demannosylation, oligomerization, and conformation. Consequently, these two NGSs are required for GP incorporation into EBOV-like particles and HIV type 1 (HIV-1) pseudovirions and determine viral transduction efficiency. Using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we knocked out the two classical endoplasmic reticulum chaperones calnexin (CNX) and/or calreticulin (CRT) and found that both CNX and CRT increase GP expression. Nevertheless, NGSs are not required for the GP interaction with CNX or CRT. Together, we conclude that, although Asn563 and Asn618 are not required for EBOV GP expression, they synergistically regulate its maturation, which determines its functionality.

28195574	Gene replacement therapies utilizing adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors hold great promise for treating Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). A related approach uses AAV vectors to edit specific regions of the DMD gene using CRISPR/Cas9. Here we develop multiple approaches for editing the mutation in dystrophic mdx4cv mice using single and dual AAV vector delivery of a muscle-specific Cas9 cassette together with single-guide RNA cassettes and, in one approach, a dystrophin homology region to fully correct the mutation. Muscle-restricted Cas9 expression enables direct editing of the mutation, multi-exon deletion or complete gene correction via homologous recombination in myogenic cells. Treated muscles express dystrophin in up to 70% of the myogenic area and increased force generation following intramuscular delivery. Furthermore, systemic administration of the vectors results in widespread expression of dystrophin in both skeletal and cardiac muscles. Our results demonstrate that AAV-mediated muscle-specific gene editing has significant potential for therapy of neuromuscular disorders.

28195124	The degree and dynamics of translational control during mammalian development remain poorly understood. Here we monitored translation of the mammalian genome as cells become specified and organize into tissues in vivo. This identified unexpected and pervasive translational regulation of most of the core signalling circuitry including Shh, Wnt, Hippo, PI3K and MAPK pathways. We further identify and functionally characterize a complex landscape of upstream open reading frames (uORFs) across 5'-untranslated regions (UTRs) of key signalling components. Focusing on the Shh pathway, we demonstrate the importance of uORFs within the major SHH receptor, Ptch1, in control of cell signalling and neuronal differentiation. Finally, we show that the expression of hundreds of mRNAs underlying critical tissue-specific developmental processes is largely regulated at the translation but not transcript levels. Altogether, this work reveals a new layer of translational control to major signalling components and gene regulatory networks that diversifies gene expression spatially across developing tissues.

28191903	We demonstrate editing of post-mitotic neurons in the adult mouse brain following injection of Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes in the hippocampus, striatum and cortex. Engineered variants of Cas9 with multiple SV40 nuclear localization sequences enabled a tenfold increase in the efficiency of neuronal editing in vivo. These advances indicate the potential of genome editing in the brain to correct or inactivate the underlying genetic causes of neurological diseases.

28191901	Base editing induces single-nucleotide changes in the DNA of living cells using a fusion protein containing a catalytically defective Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9, a cytidine deaminase, and an inhibitor of base excision repair. This genome editing approach has the advantage that it does not require formation of double-stranded DNA breaks or provision of a donor DNA template. Here we report the development of five C to T (or G to A) base editors that use natural and engineered Cas9 variants with different protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) specificities to expand the number of sites that can be targeted by base editing 2.5-fold. Additionally, we engineered base editors containing mutated cytidine deaminase domains that narrow the width of the editing window from ∼5 nucleotides to as little as 1-2 nucleotides. We thereby enabled discrimination of neighboring C nucleotides, which would otherwise be edited with similar efficiency, and doubled the number of disease-associated target Cs able to be corrected preferentially over nearby non-target Cs.

28189747	Genome editing enabled unprecedented new opportunities for targeted genomic engineering of a wide variety of organisms ranging from microbes, plants, animals and even human embryos. The serial establishing and rapid applications of genome editing tools significantly accelerated Bombyx mori (B. mori) research during the past years. However, the only CRISPR system in B. mori was the commonly used SpCas9, which only recognize target sites containing NGG PAM sequence. In the present study, we first improve the efficiency of our previous established SpCas9 system by 3.5 folds. The improved high efficiency was also observed at several loci in both BmNs cells and B. mori embryos. Then to expand the target sites, we showed that two newly discovered CRISPR system, SaCas9 and AsCpf1, could also induce highly efficient site-specific genome editing in BmNs cells, and constructed an integrated CRISPR system. Genome-wide analysis of targetable sites was further conducted and showed that the integrated system cover 69,144,399 sites in B. mori genome, and one site could be found in every 6.5 bp. The efficiency and resolution of this CRISPR platform will probably accelerate both fundamental researches and applicable studies in B. mori, and perhaps other insects.

28188619	Chromosomal rearrangements encoding oncogenic fusion proteins are found in a wide variety of malignancies. The use of programmable nucleases to generate specific double-strand breaks in endogenous loci, followed by non-homologous end joining DNA repair, has allowed several of these translocations to be generated as constitutively expressed fusion genes within a cell population. Here, we describe a novel approach that combines CRISPR-Cas9 technology with homology-directed repair to engineer, capture, and modulate the expression of chromosomal translocation products in a human cell line. We have applied this approach to the genetic modelling of t(11;22)(q24;q12) and t(11;22)(p13;q12), translocation products of the EWSR1 gene and its 3' fusion partners FLI1 and WT1, present in Ewing's sarcoma and desmoplastic small round cell tumour, respectively. Our innovative approach allows for temporal control of the expression of engineered endogenous chromosomal rearrangements, and provides a means to generate models to study tumours driven by fusion genes.

28182397	Rats were the first mammalian species domesticated for scientific purposes, and they soon became the most widely used animal model in biomedical sciences, including cardiovascular research and behavioral neuroscience. Yet, after the development of technologies to manipulate genes, researchers largely shifted to the use of mice. However, as we lay out with examples from drug addiction, social behavior, and cardiovascular research, rats have experimental advantages over mice. With the introduction of zinc-finger nuclease (ZFN), transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) methodologies, and, specifically, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) associated system, gene targeting is no longer limited to mice. Development of genetic technologies in rats allows researchers to take advantage of the unique opportunities offered by this species in biomedical research.	JR Homberg|M Wöhr|N Alenina
28179459	The CRISPR/Cas9 system has revolutionized genome editing in virtually all organisms. Although the CRISPR/Cas9 system enables the targeted cleavage of genomic DNA, its use for gene knock-in remains challenging because levels of homologous recombination activity vary among various cells. In contrast, the efficiency of homology-independent DNA repair is relatively high in most cell types. Therefore the use of a homology-independent repair mechanism is a possible alternative for efficient genome editing. Here we constructed a donor knock-in vector optimized for the CRISPR/Cas9 system and developed a practical system that enables efficient disruption of target genes by exploiting homology-independent repair. Using this practical knock-in system, we successfully disrupted genes encoding proteins involved in ciliary protein trafficking, including IFT88 and IFT20, in hTERT-RPE1 cells, which have low homologous recombination activity. The most critical concern using the CRISPR/Cas9 system is off-target cleavage. To reduce the off-target cleavage frequency and increase the versatility of our knock-in system, we constructed a universal donor vector and an expression vector containing Cas9 with enhanced specificity and tandem sgRNA expression cassettes. We demonstrated that the second version of our system has improved usability.	Y Katoh|S Michisaka|S Nozaki|T Funabashi|T Hirano|R Takei|K Nakayama
28177825	Genomic engineering using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) protein is a promising approach for targeting the genomic DNA of virtually any organism in a sequence-specific manner. Recent remarkable advances in CRISPR/Cas technology have made it a feasible system for use in therapeutic applications and biotechnology. In the CRISPR/Cas system, a guide RNA (gRNA), interacting with the Cas protein, recognizes a genomic region with sequence complementarity, and the double-stranded DNA at the target site is cleaved by the Cas protein. A widely used gRNA is an RNA polymerase III (pol III)-driven single gRNA (sgRNA), which is produced by artificial fusion of CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and trans-activation crRNA (tracrRNA). However, we identified a TTTT stretch, known as a termination signal of RNA pol III, in the scaffold region of the sgRNA. Here, we revealed that sgRNA carrying a TTTT stretch reduces the efficiency of sgRNA transcription due to premature transcriptional termination, and decreases the efficiency of genome editing. Unexpectedly, it was also shown that the premature terminated sgRNA may have an adverse effect of inducing RNA interference. Such disadvantageous effects were avoided by substituting one base in the TTTT stretch.	K Ui-Tei|S Maruyama|Y Nakano
28177771	With the introduction of precision genome editing using CRISPR-Cas9 technology, we have entered a new era of genetic engineering and gene therapy. With RNA-guided endonucleases, such as Cas9, it is possible to engineer DNA double strand breaks (DSB) at specific genomic loci. DSB repair by the error-prone non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway can disrupt a target gene by generating insertions and deletions. Alternatively, Cas9-mediated DSBs can be repaired by homology-directed repair (HDR) using an homologous DNA repair template, thus allowing precise gene editing by incorporating genetic changes into the repair template. HDR can introduce gene sequences for protein epitope tags, delete genes, make point mutations, or alter enhancer and promoter activities. In anticipation of adapting this technology for gene therapy in human somatic cells, much focus has been placed on increasing the fidelity of CRISPR-Cas9 and increasing HDR efficiency to improve precision genome editing. In this review, we will discuss applications of CRISPR technology for gene inactivation and genome editing with a focus on approaches to enhancing CRISPR-Cas9-mediated HDR for the generation of cell and animal models, and conclude with a discussion of recent advances and challenges towards the application of this technology for gene therapy in humans.

28167287	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated protein-9 nuclease (Cas9) can be used for the specific disruption of a target gene to permanently suppress the expression of the protein encoded by the target gene. Efficient delivery of the system to an intracellular target site should be achieved to utilize the tremendous potential of the genome-editing tool in biomedical applications such as the knock-out of disease-related genes and the correction of defect genes. Here, we devise polymeric CRISPR/Cas9 system based on poly-ribonucleoprotein (RNP) nanoparticles consisting of polymeric sgRNA, siRNA, and Cas9 endonuclease in order to improve the delivery efficiency. When delivered by cationic lipids, the RNP nanoparticles built with chimeric poly-sgRNA/siRNA sequences generate multiple sgRNA-Cas9 RNP complexes upon the Dicer-mediated digestion of the siRNA parts, leading to more efficient disruption of the target gene in cells and animal models, compared with the monomeric sgRNA-Cas9 RNP complex.

28166719	The CRISPR-Cas systems in prokaryotes are RNA-guided immune systems that target and deactivate foreign nucleic acids. A typical CRISPR-Cas system consists of a CRISPR array of repeat and spacer units, and a locus of cas genes. The CRISPR and the cas locus are often located next to each other in the genomes. However, there is no quantitative estimate of the co-location. In addition, ad-hoc studies have shown that some non-CRISPR genomic elements contain repeat-spacer-like structures and are mistaken as CRISPRs.	Using available genome sequences, we observed that a significant number of genomes have isolated cas loci and/or CRISPRs. We found that 11%, 22% and 28% of the type I, II and III cas loci are isolated (without CRISPRs in the same genomes at all or with CRISPRs distant in the genomes), respectively. We identified a large number of genomic elements that superficially reassemble CRISPRs but don't contain diverse spacers and have no companion cas genes. We called these elements false-CRISPRs and further classified them into groups, including tandem repeats and Staphylococcus aureus repeat (STAR)-like elements.	This is the first systematic study to collect and characterize false-CRISPR elements. We demonstrated that false-CRISPRs could be used to reduce the false annotation of CRISPRs, therefore showing them to be useful for improving the annotation of CRISPR-Cas systems.	Q Zhang|Y Ye
28165460	The development of new drug regimens that allow rapid, sterilizing treatment of tuberculosis has been limited by the complexity and time required for genetic manipulations in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) promises to be a robust, easily engineered and scalable platform for regulated gene silencing. However, in M. tuberculosis, the existing Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9-based CRISPRi system is of limited utility because of relatively poor knockdown efficiency and proteotoxicity. To address these limitations, we screened eleven diverse Cas9 orthologues and identified four that are broadly functional for targeted gene knockdown in mycobacteria. The most efficacious of these proteins, the CRISPR1 Cas9 from Streptococcus thermophilus (dCas9Sth1), typically achieves 20- to 100-fold knockdown of endogenous gene expression with minimal proteotoxicity. In contrast to other CRISPRi systems, dCas9Sth1-mediated gene knockdown is robust when targeted far from the transcriptional start site, thereby allowing high-resolution dissection of gene function in the context of bacterial operons. We demonstrate the utility of this system by addressing persistent controversies regarding drug synergies in the mycobacterial folate biosynthesis pathway. We anticipate that the dCas9Sth1 CRISPRi system will have broad utility for functional genomics, genetic interaction mapping and drug-target profiling in M. tuberculosis.

28162770	The genetic dependencies of human cancers widely vary. Here, we catalog this heterogeneity and use it to identify functional gene interactions and genotype-dependent liabilities in cancer. By using genome-wide CRISPR-based screens, we generate a gene essentiality dataset across 14 human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines. Sets of genes with correlated patterns of essentiality across the lines reveal new gene relationships, the essential substrates of enzymes, and the molecular functions of uncharacterized proteins. Comparisons of differentially essential genes between Ras-dependent and -independent lines uncover synthetic lethal partners of oncogenic Ras. Screens in both human AML and engineered mouse pro-B cells converge on a surprisingly small number of genes in the Ras processing and MAPK pathways and pinpoint PREX1 as an AML-specific activator of MAPK signaling. Our findings suggest general strategies for defining mammalian gene networks and synthetic lethal interactions by exploiting the natural genetic and epigenetic diversity of human cancer cells.

28160363	Plant-produced glycoproteins contain N-linked glycans with plant-specific residues of β(1,2)-xylose and core α(1,3)-fucose, which do not exist in mammalian-derived proteins. Although our experience with two enzymes that are used for enzyme replacement therapy does not indicate that the plant sugar residues have deleterious effects, we made a conscious decision to eliminate these moieties from plant-expressed proteins. We knocked out the β(1,2)-xylosyltranferase (XylT) and the α(1,3)-fucosyltransferase (FucT) genes, using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, in Nicotiana tabacum L. cv Bright Yellow 2 (BY2) cell suspension. In total, we knocked out 14 loci. The knocked-out lines were stable, viable and exhibited a typical BY2 growing rate. Glycan analysis of the endogenous proteins of these lines exhibited N-linked glycans lacking β(1,2)-xylose and/or α(1,3)-fucose. The knocked-out lines were further transformed successfully with recombinant DNaseI. The expression level and the activity of the recombinant protein were similar to that of the protein produced in the wild-type BY2 cells. The recombinant DNaseI was shown to be totally free from any xylose and/or fucose residues. The glyco-engineered BY2 lines provide a valuable platform for producing potent biopharmaceutical products. Furthermore, these results demonstrate the power of the CRISPR/Cas9 technology for multiplex gene editing in BY2 cells.

28159628	In recent years, versatile genetic tools have been developed and applied to a number of filamentous fungi of industrial importance. However, the existing techniques have limitations when it comes to achieve the desired genetic modifications, especially for efficient gene targeting. In this study, we used Aspergillus carbonarius as a host strain due to its potential as a cell factory, and compared three gene targeting techniques by disrupting the ayg1 gene involved in the biosynthesis of conidial pigment in A. carbonarius. The absence of the ayg1 gene leads to phenotypic change in conidia color, which facilitated the analysis on the gene targeting frequency. The examined transformation techniques included Agrobacterium-mediated transformation (AMT) and protoplast-mediated transformation (PMT). Furthermore, the PMT for the disruption of the ayg1 gene was carried out with bipartite gene targeting fragments and the recently adapted CRISPR-Cas9 system. All three techniques were successful in generating Δayg1 mutants, but showed different efficiencies. The most efficient method for gene targeting was AMT, but further it was shown to be dependent on the choice of Agrobacterium strain. However, there are different advantages and disadvantages of all three gene targeting methods which are discussed, in order to facilitate future approaches for fungal strain improvements.

28156004	Prokaryotic CRISPR-Cas system provides adaptive immunity against invasive genetic elements. Bacteria of the genus Klebsiella are important nosocomial opportunistic pathogens. However, information of CRISPR-Cas system in Klebsiella remains largely unknown. Here, we analyzed the CRISPR-Cas systems of 68 complete genomes of Klebsiella representing four species. All the elements for CRISPR-Cas system (cas genes, repeats, leader sequences, and PAMs) were characterized. Besides the typical Type I-E and I-F CRISPR-Cas systems, a new Subtype I system located in the ABC transport system-glyoxalase region was found. The conservation of the new subtype CRISPR system between different species showed new evidence for CRISPR horizontal transfer. CRISPR polymorphism was strongly correlated both with species and multilocus sequence types. Some results indicated the function of adaptive immunity: most spacers (112 of 124) matched to prophages and plasmids and no matching housekeeping genes; new spacer acquisition was observed within the same sequence type (ST) and same clonal complex; the identical spacers were observed only in the ancient position (far from the leader) between different STs and clonal complexes. Interestingly, a high ratio of self-targeting spacers (7.5%, 31 of 416) was found in CRISPR-bearing Klebsiella pneumoniae (61%, 11 of 18). In some strains, there even were multiple full matching self-targeting spacers. Some self-targeting spacers were conserved even between different STs. These results indicated that some unknown mechanisms existed to compromise the function of self-targets of CRISPR-Cas systems in K. pneumoniae.	J Shen|L Lv|X Wang|Z Xiu|G Chen

28140746	Since the rapid emergence of clustered regulatory interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) system, developed as a genome engineering tool in 2012-2013, most researchers in the life science field have had a fixated interest in this fascinating technology. CRISPR-Cas9 is an RNA-guided DNA endonuclease system, which consists of Cas9 nuclease defining a few targeting base via protospacer adjacent motif complexed with easily customizable single guide RNA targeting around 20-bp genomic sequence. Although Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9), one of the Cas9 proteins that applications in genome engineering were first demonstrated, still has wide usage because of its high nuclease activity and broad targeting range, there are several limitations such as large molecular weight and potential off-target effect. In this commentary, we describe various improvements and alternatives of CRISPR-Cas systems, including engineered Cas9 variants, Cas9 homologs, and novel Cas proteins other than Cas9. These variations enable flexible genome engineering with high efficiency and specificity, orthogonal genetic control at multiple gene loci, gene knockdown, or fluorescence imaging of transcripts mediated by RNA targeting, and beyond.

28129118	Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is caused by (CTG⋅CAG)n-repeat expansion within the DMPK gene and thought to be mediated by a toxic RNA gain of function. Current attempts to develop therapy for this disease mainly aim at destroying or blocking abnormal properties of mutant DMPK (CUG)n RNA. Here, we explored a DNA-directed strategy and demonstrate that single clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9-cleavage in either its 5' or 3' unique flank promotes uncontrollable deletion of large segments from the expanded trinucleotide repeat, rather than formation of short indels usually seen after double-strand break repair. Complete and precise excision of the repeat tract from normal and large expanded DMPK alleles in myoblasts from unaffected individuals, DM1 patients, and a DM1 mouse model could be achieved at high frequency by dual CRISPR/Cas9-cleavage at either side of the (CTG⋅CAG)n sequence. Importantly, removal of the repeat appeared to have no detrimental effects on the expression of genes in the DM1 locus. Moreover, myogenic capacity, nucleocytoplasmic distribution, and abnormal RNP-binding behavior of transcripts from the edited DMPK gene were normalized. Dual sgRNA-guided excision of the (CTG⋅CAG)n tract by CRISPR/Cas9 technology is applicable for developing isogenic cell lines for research and may provide new therapeutic opportunities for patients with DM1.

28129107	Huntington disease (HD) is a fatal dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by CAG repeat expansion (>36 repeats) within the first exon of the huntingtin gene. Although mutant huntingtin (mHTT) is ubiquitously expressed, the brain shows robust and early degeneration. Current RNA interference-based approaches for lowering mHTT expression have been efficacious in mouse models, but basal mutant protein levels are still detected. To fully mitigate expression from the mutant allele, we hypothesize that allele-specific genome editing can occur via prevalent promoter-resident SNPs in heterozygosity with the mutant allele. Here, we identified SNPs that either cause or destroy PAM motifs critical for CRISPR-selective editing of one allele versus the other in cells from HD patients and in a transgenic HD model harboring the human allele.

Recently, genome editing based on the bacterial defense mechanism CRISPR/Cas9 has emerged as an easily applicable and reliable laboratory tool.

28125791	RNA-guided nucleases (RGNs) provide sequence-specific gene regulation through base-pairing interactions between a small RNA guide and target RNA or DNA. RGN systems, which include CRISPR-Cas9 and RNA interference (RNAi), hold tremendous promise as programmable tools for engineering and therapeutic purposes. However, pervasive targeting of sequences that closely resemble the intended target has remained a major challenge, limiting the reliability and interpretation of RGN activity and the range of possible applications. Efforts to reduce off-target activity and enhance RGN specificity have led to a collection of empirically derived rules, which often paradoxically include decreased binding affinity of the RNA-guided nuclease to its target. We consider the kinetics of these reactions and show that basic kinetic properties can explain the specificities observed in the literature and the changes in these specificities in engineered systems. The kinetic models described provide a foundation for understanding RGN targeting and a necessary conceptual framework for their rational engineering.	N Bisaria|I Jarmoskaite|D Herschlag

28124743	Since the discovery of the CRISPR-Cas system as the adaptive immune system of prokaryotes, the underlying mechanism has proven to be a precise molecular tool for the targeted editing of genetic information in various cell types. By using the CRISPR-Cas9 system DNA sequences can be cut out at any site in the genome and changed in a sequence-specific manner. In the long term this provides the opportunity to cure diseases caused by gene mutations.	GA Heinz|MF Mashreghi
28122229	Vascular mural cells (vMCs) are essential components of the vertebrate vascular system, controlling blood vessel maturation and homeostasis. Discrete molecular mechanisms have been associated with vMC development and differentiation. The function of hemodynamic forces in controlling vMC recruitment is unclear. Using transgenic lines marking developing vMCs in zebrafish embryos, we find that vMCs are recruited by arterial-fated vessels and that the process is flow dependent. We take advantage of tissue-specific CRISPR gene targeting to demonstrate that hemodynamic-dependent Notch activation and the ensuing arterial genetic program is driven by endothelial primary cilia. We also identify zebrafish foxc1b as a cilia-dependent Notch-specific target that is required within endothelial cells to drive vMC recruitment. In summary, we have identified a hemodynamic-dependent mechanism in the developing vasculature that controls vMC recruitment.	X Chen|D Gays|C Milia|MM Santoro
28118392	CRISPR/Cas9 screening has proven to be a versatile tool for genomics research. Based on unexpected results from a genome-wide screen, we developed a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated approach to mutagenesis, exploiting the allelic diversity generated by error-prone non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) to identify novel gain-of-function and drug resistant alleles of the MAPK signaling pathway genes MEK1 and BRAF. We define the parameters of a scalable technique to easily generate cell populations containing thousands of endogenous allelic variants to map gene functions. Further, these results highlight an unexpected but important phenomenon, that Cas9-induced gain-of-function alleles are an inherent by-product of normal Cas9 loss-of-function screens and should be investigated during analysis of data from large-scale positive selection screens.

28116670	Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are an important system to study early human development, model human diseases, and develop cell replacement therapies. However, genetic manipulation of hPSCs is challenging and a method to simultaneously activate multiple genomic sites in a controllable manner is sorely needed. Here, we constructed a CRISPR-ON system to efficiently upregulate endogenous genes in hPSCs. A doxycycline (Dox) inducible dCas9-VP64-p65-Rta (dCas9-VPR) transcription activator and a reverse Tet transactivator (rtTA) expression cassette were knocked into the two alleles of the AAVS1 locus to generate an iVPR hESC line. We showed that the dCas9-VPR level could be precisely and reversibly controlled by the addition and withdrawal of Dox. Upon transfection of multiplexed gRNA plasmid targeting the NANOG promoter and Dox induction, we were able to control NANOG gene expression from its endogenous locus. Interestingly, an elevated NANOG level promoted naïve pluripotent gene expression, enhanced cell survival and clonogenicity, and enabled hESCs to integrate with the inner cell mass (ICM) of mouse blastocysts in vitro. Thus, iVPR cells provide a convenient platform for gene function studies as well as high-throughput screens in hPSCs.	J Guo|D Ma|R Huang|J Ming|M Ye|K Kee|Z Xie|J Na
28115465	MRP RNA is an abundant, essential noncoding RNA whose functions have been proposed in yeast but are incompletely understood in humans. Mutations in the genomic locus for MRP RNA cause pleiotropic human diseases, including cartilage hair hypoplasia (CHH). Here we applied CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing to disrupt the endogenous human MRP RNA locus, thereby attaining what has eluded RNAi and RNase H experiments: elimination of MRP RNA in the majority of cells. The resulting accumulation of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) precursor-analyzed by RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), Northern blots, and RNA sequencing-implicates MRP RNA in pre-rRNA processing. Amelioration of pre-rRNA imbalance is achieved through rescue of MRP RNA levels by ectopic expression. Furthermore, affinity-purified MRP ribonucleoprotein (RNP) from HeLa cells cleaves the human pre-rRNA in vitro at at least one site used in cells, while RNP isolated from cells with CRISPR-edited MRP loci loses this activity, and ectopic MRP RNA expression restores cleavage activity. Thus, a role for RNase MRP in human pre-rRNA processing is established. As demonstrated here, targeted CRISPR disruption is a valuable tool for functional studies of essential noncoding RNAs that are resistant to RNAi and RNase H-based degradation.	KC Goldfarb|TR Cech
28114398	CRISPR-Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-CRISPR-associated) systems are RNA-guided adaptive immunity pathways used by bacteria and archaea to defend against phages and plasmids. Type III-A systems use a multisubunit interference complex called Csm, containing Cas proteins and a CRISPR RNA (crRNA) to target cognate nucleic acids. The Csm complex is intriguing in that it mediates RNA-guided targeting of both RNA and transcriptionally active DNA, but the mechanism is not well understood. Here, we overexpressed the five components of the Thermus thermophilus (T. thermophilus) Type III-A Csm complex (TthCsm) with a defined crRNA sequence, and purified intact TthCsm complexes from E. coli cells. The complexes were thermophilic, targeting complementary ssRNA more efficiently at 65°C than at 37°C. Sequence-independent, endonucleolytic cleavage of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) by TthCsm was triggered by recognition of a complementary ssRNA, and required a lack of complementarity between the first 8 nucleotides (5' tag) of the crRNA and the 3' flanking region of the ssRNA. Mutation of the histidine-aspartate (HD) nuclease domain of the TthCsm subunit, Cas10/Csm1, abolished DNA cleavage. Activation of DNA cleavage was dependent on RNA binding but not cleavage. This leads to a model in which binding of an ssRNA target to the Csm complex would stimulate cleavage of exposed ssDNA in the cell, such as could occur when the RNA polymerase unwinds double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) during transcription. Our findings establish an amenable, thermostable system for more in-depth investigation of the targeting mechanism using structural biology methods, such as cryo-electron microscopy and x-ray crystallography.

28112180	Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), also known as neural apoptosis regulated convertase (NARC1), is a key modulator of cholesterol metabolism. PCSK9 increases the serum concentration of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by escorting low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLRs) from the membrane of hepatic cells into lysosomes, where the LDLRs are degraded. Owing to the importance of PCSK9 in lipid metabolism, considerable effort has been made over the past decade in developing drugs targeting PCSK9 to lower serum lipid levels. Nevertheless, some problems and challenges remain. In this review we first describes the structure and function of PCSK9 and its gene polymorphisms. We then discuss the various designs of pharmacological targets of PCSK9, including those that block the binding of PCSK9 to hepatic LDLRs (mimetic peptides, adnectins, and monoclonal antibodies), inhibit PCSK9 expression (the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/Cas9 platform, small molecules, antisense oligonucleotides, and small interfering RNAs), and interfere with PCSK9 secretion. Finally, this review highlights future challenges in this field, including safety concerns associated with PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies, the limited utility of PCSK9 inhibitors in the central nervous system, and the cost-effectiveness of PCSK9 inhibitors.

28110021	Axon growth is coordinated by multiple interacting proteins that remain incompletely characterized. High content screening (HCS), in which manipulation of candidate genes is combined with rapid image analysis of phenotypic effects, has emerged as a powerful technique to identify key regulators of axon outgrowth. Here we explore the utility of a genome editing approach referred to as CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspersed Palindromic Repeats) for knockout screening in primary neurons. In the CRISPR approach a DNA-cleaving Cas enzyme is guided to genomic target sequences by user-created guide RNA (sgRNA), where it initiates a double-stranded break that ultimately results in frameshift mutation and loss of protein production. Using electroporation of plasmid DNA that co-expresses Cas9 enzyme and sgRNA, we first verified the ability of CRISPR targeting to achieve protein-level knockdown in cultured postnatal cortical neurons. Targeted proteins included NeuN (RbFox3) and PTEN, a well-studied regulator of axon growth. Effective knockdown lagged at least four days behind transfection, but targeted proteins were eventually undetectable by immunohistochemistry in >80% of transfected cells. Consistent with this, anti-PTEN sgRNA produced no changes in neurite outgrowth when assessed three days post-transfection. When week-long cultures were replated, however, PTEN knockdown consistently increased neurite lengths. These CRISPR-mediated PTEN effects were achieved using multi-well transfection and automated phenotypic analysis, indicating the suitability of PTEN as a positive control for future CRISPR-based screening efforts. Combined, these data establish an example of CRISPR-mediated protein knockdown in primary cortical neurons and its compatibility with HCS workflows.

28108316	Discovered as a bacterial adaptive immune system, CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeat/CRISPR associated) is being developed as an attractive tool in genome editing. Due to its high specificity and applicability, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing has been employed in a multitude of organisms and cells, including insects, for not only fundamental research such as gene function studies, but also applied research such as modification of organisms of economic importance. Despite the rapid increase in the use of CRISPR in insect genome editing, results still differ from each study, principally due to existing differences in experimental parameters, such as the Cas9 and guide RNA form, the delivery method, the target gene and off-target effects. Here, we review current reports on the successes of CRISPR/Cas9 applications in diverse insects and insect cells. We furthermore summarize several best practices to give a useful checklist of CRISPR/Cas9 experimental setup in insects for beginners. Lastly, we discuss the biosafety concerns related to the release of CRISPR/Cas9-edited insects into the environment.	CNT Taning|B Van Eynde|N Yu|S Ma|G Smagghe
28107504	The neural crest is a source to produce multipotent neural crest stem cells that have a potential to differentiate into diverse cell types. The transcription factor SOX10 is expressed through early neural crest progenitors and stem cells in vertebrates. Here we report the generation of SOX10-Nano-lantern (NL) reporter human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPS) by using CRISPR/Cas9 systems, that are beneficial to investigate the generation and maintenance of neural crest progenitor cells. SOX10-NL positive cells are produced transiently from hiPS cells by treatment with TGFβ inhibitor SB431542 and GSK3 inhibitor CHIR99021. We found that all SOX10-NL-positive cells expressed an early neural crest marker NGFR, however SOX10-NL-positive cells purified from differentiated hiPS cells progressively attenuate their NL-expression under proliferation. We therefore attempted to maintain SOX10-NL-positive cells with additional signaling on the plane and sphere culture conditions. These SOX10-NL cells provide us to investigate mass culture with neural crest cells for stem cell research.	T Horikiri|H Ohi|M Shibata|M Ikeya|M Ueno|C Sotozono|S Kinoshita|T Sato
28105943	In recent years, the damage caused by bacterial pathogens to major crops has been increasing worldwide. Pseudomonas syringae is a widespread bacterial species that infects almost all major crops. Different P. syringae strains use a wide range of biochemical mechanisms, including phytotoxins and effectors of the type III and type IV secretion systems, which determine the specific nature of the pathogen virulence.	Strains 1845 (isolated from dicots) and 2507 (isolated from monocots) were selected for sequencing because they specialize on different groups of plants. We compared virulence factors in these and other available genomes of phylogroup 2 to find genes responsible for the specialization of bacteria. We showed that strain 1845 belongs to the clonal group that has been infecting monocots in Russia and USA for a long time (at least 50 years). Strain 1845 has relatively recently changed its host plant to dicots.	The results obtained by comparing the strain 1845 genome with the genomes of bacteria infecting monocots can help to identify the genes that define specific nature of the virulence of P. syringae strains.

28104802	Two putative heat-responsive genes, ssl2245 and sll1130, constitute an operon that also has characteristics of a toxin-antitoxin system, thus joining several enigmatic features. Closely related orthologs of Ssl2245 and Sll1130 exist in widely different bacteria, which thrive under environments with large fluctuations in temperature and salinity, among which some are thermo-epilithic biofilm-forming cyanobacteria. Transcriptome analyses revealed that the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) genes as well as several hypothetical genes were commonly up-regulated in Δssl2245 and Δsll1130 mutants. Genes coding for heat shock proteins and pilins were also induced in Δsll1130 We observed that the majority of cells in a Δsll1130 mutant strain remained unicellular and viable after prolonged incubation at high temperature (50 °C). In contrast, the wild type formed large cell clumps of dead and live cells, indicating the attempt to form biofilms under harsh conditions. Furthermore, we observed that Sll1130 is a heat-stable ribonuclease whose activity was inhibited by Ssl2245 at optimal temperatures but not at high temperatures. In addition, we demonstrated that Ssl2245 is physically associated with Sll1130 by electrostatic interactions, thereby inhibiting its activity at optimal growth temperature. This association is lost upon exposure to heat, leaving Sll1130 to exhibit its ribonuclease activity. Thus, the activation of Sll1130 leads to the degradation of cellular RNA and thereby heat-induced programmed cell death that in turn supports the formation of a more resistant biofilm for the surviving cells. We suggest to designate Ssl2245 and Sll1130 as MazE and MazF, respectively.	A Srikumar|PS Krishna|D Sivaramakrishna|S Kopfmann|WR Hess|MJ Swamy|S Lin-Chao|JS Prakash
28104689	We identified apilimod as an antiproliferative compound by high-throughput screening of clinical-stage drugs. Apilimod exhibits exquisite specificity for phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate 5-kinase (PIKfyve) lipid kinase and has selective cytotoxic activity in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) compared with normal cells. Apilimod displays nanomolar activity in vitro, and in vivo studies demonstrate single-agent efficacy as well as synergy with approved B-NHL drugs. Using biochemical and knockdown approaches, and discovery of a kinase domain mutation conferring resistance, we demonstrate that apilimod-mediated cytotoxicity is driven by PIKfyve inhibition. Furthermore, a critical role for lysosome dysfunction as a major factor contributing to apilimod's cytotoxicity is supported by a genome-wide CRISPR screen. In the screen, TFEB (master transcriptional regulator of lysosomal biogenesis) and endosomal/lysosomal genes CLCN7, OSTM1, and SNX10 were identified as important determinants of apilimod sensitivity. These findings thus suggest that disruption of lysosomal homeostasis with apilimod represents a novel approach to treat B-NHL.

28103055	The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) associated 9 (Cas9) system is a microbial adaptive immune system that has been recently developed for genomic engineering. From the moment the CRISPR system was discovered in Escherichia coli, the drive to understand the mechanism prevailed, leading to rapid advancement in the knowledge and applications of the CRISPR system. With the ability to characterize and understand the function of the Cas9 endonuclease came the ability to adapt the CRISPR-Cas9 system for use in a variety of applications and disciplines ranging from agriculture to biomedicine. This review will provide a brief overview of the discovery and development of the CRISPR-Cas9 system in applications such as genome regulation and epigenome engineering, as well as the challenges faced.

28101689	Multidrug resistance (MDR) to pharmaceutical active agents is a common clinical problem in patients suffering from cancer. MDR is often mediated by over expression of trans-membrane xenobiotic transport molecules belonging to the superfamily of ATP-binding cassette (ABC)-transporters. This protein family includes the classical MDR-associated transporter ABCB1 (MDR1/P-gp). Inhibition of ABC-transporters by low molecular weight compounds in cancer patients has been extensively investigated in clinical trials, but the results have been disappointing. Thus, in the last decades alternative experimental therapeutic strategies for overcoming MDR were under extensive investigation. These include gene therapeutic approaches applying antisense-, ribozyme-, RNA interference-, and CRISPR/Cas9-based techniques. Various delivery strategies were used to reverse MDR in different tumor models in vitro and in vivo. Results and conclusions of these gene therapeutic studies will be discussed.	H Lage
28101685	Advances in molecular technologies have led to the discovery of many disease-related genetic mutations as well as elucidation of aberrant gene and protein expression patterns in several human diseases, including cancer. This information has driven the development of novel therapeutic strategies, such as the utilization of small molecules to target specific cellular pathways and the use of retroviral vectors to retarget immune cells to recognize and eliminate tumor cells. Retroviral-mediated gene transfer has allowed efficient production of T cells engineered with chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), which have demonstrated marked success in the treatment of hematological malignancies. As a safety point, these modified cells can be outfitted with suicide genes. Customized gene editing tools, such as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-CRISPR-associated nucleases (CRISPR-Cas9), zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs), or TAL-effector nucleases (TALENs), may also be combined with retroviral delivery to specifically delete oncogenes, inactivate oncogenic signaling pathways, or deliver wild-type genes. Additionally, the feasibility of retroviral gene transfer strategies to protect the hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) from the dose-limiting toxic effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy was demonstrated. While some of these approaches have yet to be translated into clinical application, the potential implications for improved cellular replacement therapies to enhance and/or support the current treatment modalities are enormous.

28100080	The emergence of new gene-editing technologies is profoundly transforming human therapeutics, agriculture, and industrial biotechnology. Advances in clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) have created a fertile environment for mass-scale manufacturing of cost-effective products ranging from basic research to translational medicine. In our analyses, we evaluated the patent landscape of gene-editing technologies and found that in comparison to earlier gene-editing techniques, CRISPR has gained significant traction and this has established dominance. Although most of the gene-editing technologies originated from the industry, CRISPR has been pioneered by academic research institutions. The spinout of CRISPR biotechnology companies from academic institutions demonstrates a shift in entrepreneurship strategies that were previously led by the industry. These academic institutions, and their subsequent companies, are competing to generate comprehensive intellectual property portfolios to rapidly commercialize CRISPR products. Our analysis shows that the emergence of CRISPR has resulted in a fivefold increase in genome-editing bioenterprise investment over the last year. This entrepreneurial movement has spurred a global biotechnology revolution in the realization of novel gene-editing technologies. This global shift in bioenterprise will continue to grow as the demand for personalized medicine, genetically modified crops and environmentally sustainable biofuels increases. However, the monopolization of intellectual property, negative public perception of genetic engineering and ambiguous regulatory policies may limit the growth of these market segments.

28099519	Increased expression of NOX4 protein is associated with cancer progression and metastasis but the role of NOX4 in cell proliferation and invasion is not fully understood. We generated NOX4 knockout HeLa cell lines using the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing system to explore the cellular functions of NOX4. After transfection of CRISPR-Cas9 construct, we performed T7 endonuclease 1 assays and DNA sequencing to generate and identify insertion and deletion of the NOX4 locus. We confirmed the knockout of NOX4 by Western blotting. NOX4 knockout cell lines showed reduced cell proliferation with an increase of sub-G1 cell population and the decrease of S/G2/M population. Moreover, NOX4 deficiency resulted in a dramatic decrease in invadopodium formation and the invasive activity. In addition, NOX4 deficiency also caused a decrease in focal adhesions and cell migration in HeLa cells. These results suggest that NOX4 is required for both efficient proliferation and invasion of HeLa cells.	N Jafari|H Kim|R Park|L Li|M Jang|AJ Morris|J Park|C Huang
28099430	CRISPR-based genetic screens are accelerating biological discovery, but current methods have inherent limitations. Widely used pooled screens are restricted to simple readouts including cell proliferation and sortable marker proteins. Arrayed screens allow for comprehensive molecular readouts such as transcriptome profiling, but at much lower throughput. Here we combine pooled CRISPR screening with single-cell RNA sequencing into a broadly applicable workflow, directly linking guide RNA expression to transcriptome responses in thousands of individual cells. Our method for CRISPR droplet sequencing (CROP-seq) enables pooled CRISPR screens with single-cell transcriptome resolution, which will facilitate high-throughput functional dissection of complex regulatory mechanisms and heterogeneous cell populations.

28095751	Musculoskeletal diseases have been associated with inflammatory cytokine action, particularly action by TNF-α and IL-1β. These inflammatory cytokines promote apoptosis and senescence of cells in diseased tissue and extracellular matrix breakdown. Stem cell-based therapies are being considered for the treatment of musculoskeletal diseases, but the presence of these inflammatory cytokines will have similar deleterious action on therapeutic cells delivered to these environments. Methods that prevent inflammatory-induced apoptosis and proinflammatory signaling, in cell and pathway-specific manners are needed. In this study we demonstrate the use of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based epigenome editing to alter cell response to inflammatory environments by repressing inflammatory cytokine cell receptors, specifically TNFR1 and IL1R1. We targeted CRISPR/Cas9-based repressors to TNFR1 and IL1R1 gene regulatory elements in human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) and investigated the functional outcomes of repression of these genes. Efficient signaling regulation was demonstrated in engineered hADSCs, as activity of the downstream transcription factor NF-κB was significantly reduced or maintained at baseline levels in the presence of TNF-α or IL-1β. Pellet culture of undifferentiated hADSCs demonstrated improved survival in engineered hADSCs treated with TNF-α or IL-1β, while having little effect on their immunomodulatory properties. Furthermore, engineered hADSCs demonstrated improved chondrogenic differentiation capacity in the presence of TNF-α or IL-1β, as shown by superior production of glycosaminglycans in this inflammatory environment. Overall this work demonstrates a novel method for modulating cell response to inflammatory signaling that has applications in engineering cells delivered to inflammatory environments, and as a direct gene therapy to protect endogenous cells exposed to chronic inflammation, as observed in a broad spectrum of degenerative musculoskeletal pathology.

28087399	Chronic infections with hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses (HBV and HCV) account for the majority of cases of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Current therapies for the infections have limitations and improved efficacy is necessary to prevent complications in carriers of the viruses. In the case of HBV persistence, the replication intermediate comprising covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) is particularly problematic. Licensed therapies have little effect on cccDNA and HBV replication relapses following treatment withdrawal. Disabling cccDNA is thus key to curing HBV infections and application of gene editing technology, such as harnessing the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated 9 (Cas9) system, has curative potential. Several studies have reported good efficacy when employing CRISPR/Cas technologies to disable HBV replication in cultured cells and in hydrodynamically injected mice. Recent advances with HCV drug development have revolutionized treatment of the infection. Nevertheless, individuals may be refractory to treatment. Targeting RNA from HCV with CRISPR/Cas isolated from Francisella novicida may have therapeutic utility. Although preclinical work shows that CRISPR/Cas technology has potential to overcome infection with HBV and HCV, significant challenges need to be met. Ensuring specificity for viral targets and efficient delivery of the gene editing sequences to virus-infected cells are particularly important. The field is at an interesting stage and the future of curative antiviral drug regimens, particularly for treatment of chronic HBV infection, may well entail use of combinations that include derivatives of CRISPR/Cas.

28084330	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and their associated genes (cas) are essential components of an adaptive immune system that protects bacteria and archaea from viral infection.

28081254	Genome manipulation in the mouse via microinjection of CRISPR/Cas9 site-specific nucleases has allowed the production time for genetically modified mouse models to be significantly reduced. Successful genome manipulation in the mouse has already been reported using Cas9 supplied by microinjection of a DNA construct, in vitro transcribed mRNA and recombinant protein. Recently the use of transgenic strains of mice overexpressing Cas9 has been shown to facilitate site-specific mutagenesis via maternal supply to zygotes and this route may provide an alternative to exogenous supply. We have investigated the feasibility of supplying Cas9 genetically in more detail and for this purpose we report the generation of a transgenic mice which overexpress Cas9 ubiquitously, via a CAG-Cas9 transgene targeted to the Gt(ROSA26)Sor locus. We show that zygotes prepared from female mice harbouring this transgene are sufficiently loaded with maternally contributed Cas9 for efficient production of embryos and mice harbouring indel, genomic deletion and knock-in alleles by microinjection of guide RNAs and templates alone. We compare the mutagenesis rates and efficacy of mutagenesis using this genetic supply with exogenous Cas9 supply by either mRNA or protein microinjection. In general, we report increased generation rates of knock-in alleles and show that the levels of mutagenesis at certain genome target sites are significantly higher and more consistent when Cas9 is supplied genetically relative to exogenous supply.

28067217	The CRISPR-Cas9 system provides a versatile toolkit for genome engineering that can introduce various DNA lesions at specific genomic locations. However, a better understanding of the nature of these lesions and the repair pathways engaged is critical to realizing the full potential of this technology. Here we characterize the different lesions arising from each Cas9 variant and the resulting repair pathway engagement. We demonstrate that the presence and polarity of the overhang structure is a critical determinant of double-strand break repair pathway choice. Similarly, single nicks deriving from different Cas9 variants differentially activate repair: D10A but not N863A-induced nicks are repaired by homologous recombination. Finally, we demonstrate that homologous recombination is required for repairing lesions using double-stranded, but not single-stranded DNA as a template. This detailed characterization of repair pathway choice in response to CRISPR-Cas9 enables a more deterministic approach for designing research and therapeutic genome engineering strategies.

28065797	In the developing ventral telencephalon, cells of the lateral ganglionic eminence (LGE) give rise to all medium spiny neurons (MSNs). This development occurs in response to a highly orchestrated series of morphogenetic stimuli that pattern the resultant neurons as they develop. Striatal MSNs are characterised by expression of dopamine receptors, dopamine-and cyclic AMP-regulated phosphoprotein (DARPP32) and the neurotransmitter GABA. In this study, we demonstrate that fine tuning Wnt and hedgehog (SHH) signaling early in human embryonic stem cell differentiation can induce a subpallial progenitor molecular profile. Stimulation of TGFβ signaling pathway by activin-A further supports patterning of progenitors to striatal precursors which adopt an LGE-specific gene signature. Moreover, we report that these MSNs also express markers associated with mature neuron function (cannabinoid, adenosine and dopamine receptors). To facilitate live-cell identification we generated a human embryonic stem cell line using CRISPR-mediated gene editing at the DARPP32 locus (DARPP32WT/eGFP-AMP-LacZ). The addition of dopamine to MSNs either increased, decreased or had no effect on intracellular calcium, indicating the presence of multiple dopamine receptor subtypes. In summary, we demonstrate greater control over early fate decisions using activin-A, Wnt and SHH to direct differentiation into MSNs. We also generate a DARPP32 reporter line that enables deeper pharmacological profiling and interrogation of complex receptor interactions in human MSNs.	CPJ Hunt|CW Pouton|JM Haynes
28062498	To identify and characterize the effect of a SNP (single-nucleotide polymorphism) in the STXBP5 locus that is associated with altered thrombosis in humans. GWAS (genome-wide association studies) have identified numerous SNPs associated with human thrombotic phenotypes, but determining the functional significance of an individual candidate SNP can be challenging, particularly when in vivo modeling is required. Recent GWAS led to the discovery of STXBP5 as a regulator of platelet secretion in humans. Further clinical studies have identified genetic variants of STXBP5 that are linked to altered plasma von Willebrand factor levels and thrombosis in humans, but the functional significance of these variants in STXBP5 is not understood.	We used CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated 9) techniques to produce a precise mouse model carrying a human coding SNP rs1039084 (encoding human p. N436S) in the STXBP5 locus associated with decreased thrombosis. Mice carrying the orthologous human mutation (encoding p. N437S in mouse STXBP5) have lower plasma von Willebrand factor levels, decreased thrombosis, and decreased platelet secretion compared with wild-type mice. This thrombosis phenotype recapitulates the phenotype of humans carrying the minor allele of rs1039084. Decreased plasma von Willebrand factor and platelet activation may partially explain the decreased thrombotic phenotype in mutant mice.	Using precise mammalian genome editing, we have identified a human nonsynonymous SNP rs1039084 in the STXBP5 locus as a causal variant for a decreased thrombotic phenotype. CRISPR/Cas9 genetic editing facilitates the rapid and efficient generation of animals to study the function of human genetic variation in vascular diseases.

28057934	Cronobacter sakazakii is an important foodborne pathogens causing rare but life-threatening diseases in neonates and infants. CRISPR-Cas system is a new prokaryotic defense system that provides adaptive immunity against phages, latter play an vital role on the evolution and pathogenicity of host bacteria. In this study, we found that genome sizes of C. sakazakii strains had a significant positive correlation with total genome sizes of prophages. Prophages contributed to 16.57% of the genetic diversity (pan genome) of C. sakazakii, some of which maybe the potential virulence factors. Subtype I-E CRISPR-Cas system and five types of CRISPR arrays were found in the conserved site of C. sakazakii strains. CRISPR1 and CRISPR2 loci with high variable spacers were active and showed potential protection against phage attacks. The number of spacers from two active CRISPR loci in clinical strains was significant less than that of foodborne strains, it maybe a reason why clinical strains were found to have more prophages than foodborne strains. The frequently gain/loss of prophages and spacers in CRISPR loci is likely to drive the quick evolution of C. sakazakii. Our study provides a new insight into the co-evolution of phages and C. sakazakii.	H Zeng|J Zhang|C Li|T Xie|N Ling|Q Wu|Y Ye
28056763	DNA sequences contain repetitive motifs which have various functions in the physiology of the organism. A number of methods have been developed for discovery of such sequence motifs with a primary focus on detection of regulatory motifs and particularly transcription factor binding sites. Most motif-finding methods apply probabilistic models to detect motifs characterized by unusually high number of copies of the motif in the analyzed sequences.	We present a novel method for detection of pairs of motifs separated by spacers of variable nucleotide sequence but conserved length. Unlike existing methods for motif discovery, the motifs themselves are not required to occur at unusually high frequency but only to exhibit a significant preference to occur at a specific distance from each other. In the present implementation of the method, motifs are represented by pentamers and all pairs of pentamers are evaluated for statistically significant preference for a specific distance. An important step of the algorithm eliminates motif pairs where the spacers separating the two motifs exhibit a high degree of sequence similarity; such motif pairs likely arise from duplications of the whole segment including the motifs and the spacer rather than due to selective constraints indicative of a functional importance of the motif pair. The method was used to scan 569 complete prokaryotic genomes for novel sequence motifs. Some motifs detected were previously known but other motifs found in the search appear to be novel. Selected motif pairs were subjected to further investigation and in some cases their possible biological functions were proposed.	We present a new motif-finding technique that is applicable to scanning complete genomes for sequence motifs. The results from analysis of 569 genomes suggest that the method detects previously known motifs that are expected to be found as well as new motifs that are unlikely to be discovered by traditional motif-finding methods. We conclude that our approach to detection of significant motif pairs can complement existing motif-finding techniques in discovery of novel functional sequence motifs in complete genomes.

28053071	The use of mouse models in biomedical research and preclinical drug evaluation is on the rise. The advent of new molecular genome-altering technologies such as CRISPR/Cas9 allows for genetic mutations to be introduced into the germ line of a mouse faster and less expensively than previous methods. In addition, the rapid progress in the development and use of somatic transgenesis using viral vectors, as well as manipulations of gene expression with siRNAs and antisense oligonucleotides, allow for even greater exploration into genomics and systems biology. These technological advances come at a time when cost reductions in genome sequencing have led to the identification of pathogenic mutations in patient populations, providing unprecedented opportunities in the use of mice to model human disease. The ease of genetic engineering in mice also offers a potential paradigm shift in resource sharing and the speed by which models are made available in the public domain. Predictively, the knowledge alone that a model can be quickly remade will provide relief to resources encumbered by licensing and Material Transfer Agreements. For decades, mouse strains have provided an exquisite experimental tool to study the pathophysiology of the disease and assess therapeutic options in a genetically defined system. However, a major limitation of the mouse has been the limited genetic diversity associated with common laboratory mice. This has been overcome with the recent development of the Collaborative Cross and Diversity Outbred mice. These strains provide new tools capable of replicating genetic diversity to that approaching the diversity found in human populations. The Collaborative Cross and Diversity Outbred strains thus provide a means to observe and characterize toxicity or efficacy of new therapeutic drugs for a given population. The combination of traditional and contemporary mouse genome editing tools, along with the addition of genetic diversity in new modeling systems, are synergistic and serve to make the mouse a better model for biomedical research, enhancing the potential for preclinical drug discovery and personalized medicine.

28049731	The Polycomb group (PcG) proteins have an important role in controlling the expression of key genes implicated in embryonic development, differentiation, and decision of cell fates. Emerging evidence suggests that Polycomb repressive complexes 1 (PRC1) is defined by the six Polycomb group RING finger protein (Pcgf) paralogs, and Pcgf proteins can assemble into noncanonical PRC1 complexes. However, little is known about the precise mechanisms of differently composed noncanonical PRC1 in the maintenance of the pluripotent cell state. Here we disrupt the Pcgf genes in mouse embryonic stem cells by CRISPR-Cas9 and find Pcgf6 null embryonic stem cells display severe defects in self-renewal and differentiation. Furthermore, Pcgf6 regulates genes mostly involved in differentiation and spermatogenesis by assembling a noncanonical PRC1 complex PRC1.6. Notably, Pcgf6 deletion causes a dramatic decrease in PRC1.6 binding to target genes and no loss of H2AK119ub1. Thus, Pcgf6 is essential for recruitment of PRC1.6 to chromatin. Our results reveal a previously uncharacterized, H2AK119ub1-independent chromatin assembly associated with PRC1.6 complex.	W Zhao|H Tong|Y Huang|Y Yan|H Teng|Y Xia|Q Jiang|J Qin
28049122	The most widely used gene editing technology-the CRISPR/Cas9 system-employs a bacterial monomeric DNA endonuclease known as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated protein 9 (Cas9) and single-guide RNA (sgRNA) that directs Cas9 to a complementary target DNA. However, introducing mutations into higher polyploid plant species, especially for species without genome information, has been difficult. Chrysanthemum morifolium (chrysanthemum) is one of the most important ornamental plants, but it is a hexaploid with a large genome; moreover, it lacks whole-genome information. These characteristics hinder genome editing in chrysanthemum. In the present study, we attempted to perform gene editing using the CRISPR/Cas9 system to introduce mutations into chrysanthemum. We constructed transgenic chrysanthemum plants expressing the yellowish-green fluorescent protein gene from Chiridius poppei (CpYGFP) and targeted CpYGFP for gene editing. We compared the activity of a Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter and parsley ubiquitin promoter in chrysanthemum calli and chose the parsley ubiquitin promoter to drive Cas9. We selected two sgRNAs to target different positions in the CpYGFP gene and obtained transgenic calli containing mutated CpYGFP genes (CRISPR-CpYGFP-chrysanthemum). A DNA sequencing analysis and fluorescence observations indicated that cells containing the mutated CpYGFP gene grew independently of cells containing the original CpYGFP gene in one callus. We finally obtained the CRISPR-CpYGFP-chrysanthemum shoot containing a mutation in the CpYGFP sequence. This is the first report of gene editing using the CRISPR/Cas9 system in chrysanthemum and sheds light on chrysanthemum genome editing.	M Kishi-Kaboshi|R Aida|K Sasaki
28046023	DNA replication stress has the potential to compromise genomic stability and, therefore, cells have developed elaborate mechanisms to detect and resolve problems that may arise during DNA replication. The presence of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) is often associated with DNA replication stress and serves as a signal for both checkpoint and repair responses. In this study, we exploited a CRISPR-Cas9 system to induce regions of ssDNA in the genome. Specifically, single-guide RNAs bearing sequence complementarity to human telomeric repeats, were used to target nuclease-deficient Cas9 (dCas9) to telomeres. Such targeting was associated with the formation of DNA-RNA hybrids, leaving one telomeric DNA strand single-stranded. This ssDNA then recruited DNA repair and checkpoint proteins, such as RPA, ATRIP, BLM and Rad51, at the telomeres. Interestingly, targeting of all these proteins to telomeric ssDNA was observed even in cells that were in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Therefore, this system has the potential to serve as a platform for further investigation of DNA replication stress responses at specific loci in the human genome and in all phases of the cell cycle.

28045163	The development of CRISPR-Cas9 technology has revolutionized our ability to edit DNA and to modulate expression levels of genes of interest, thus providing powerful tools to accelerate the precise engineering of a wide range of organisms. In addition, the CRISPR-Cas system can be harnessed to design "precision" antimicrobials that target bacterial pathogens in a DNA sequence-specific manner. This capability will enable killing of drug-resistant microbes by selectively targeting genes involved in antibiotic resistance, biofilm formation and virulence. Here, we review the origins and mechanistic basis of CRISPR-Cas systems, discuss how this technology can be leveraged to provide a range of applications in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic systems, and finish by outlining limitations and future prospects.

28042089	When mammalian cells are nutrient and/or growth factor deprived, exposed to inhibitors of protein synthesis, stressed by heat shock or grown to confluence, rDNA transcription is essentially shut off. Various mechanisms are available to accomplish this downshift in ribosome biogenesis. Muramatsu's laboratory (Hanada et al., 1996) first demonstrated that mammalian PAF53 was essential for specific rDNA transcription and that PAF53 levels were regulated in response to growth factors. While S. cerevisae A49, the homologue of vertebrate PAF53, is not essential for viability (Liljelund et al., 1992), deletion of yA49 results in colonies that grow at 6% of the wild type rate at 25°C. Experiments described by Wang et al. (2015) identified PAF53 as a gene "essential for optimal proliferation". However, they did not discriminate genes essential for viability. Hence, in order to resolve this question, we designed a series of experiments to determine if PAF53 was essential for cell survival. We set out to delete the gene product from mammalian cells using CRISPR/CAS9 technology. Human 293 cells were transfected with lentiCRISPR v2 carrying genes for various sgRNA that targeted PAF53. In some experiments, the cells were cotransfected in parallel with plasmids encoding FLAG-tagged mouse PAF53. After treating the transfected cells with puromycin (to select for the lentiCRISPR backbone), cells were cloned and analyzed by western blots for PAF53 expression. Genomic DNA was amplified across the "CRISPRd" exon, cloned and sequenced to identify mutated PAF53 genes. We obtained cell lines in which the endogenous PAF53 gene was "knocked out" only when we rescued with FLAG-PAF53. DNA sequencing demonstrated that in the absence of ectopic PAF53 expression, cells demonstrated unique means of surviving; including recombination or the utilization of alternative reading frames. We never observed a clone in which one PAF53 gene is expressed, unless there was also ectopic expression In the absence of ectopic gene expression, the gene products of both endogenous genes were expressed, irrespective of whether they were partially mutant proteins or not.

29956654	Gene expression in higher eukaryotes is regulated through the involvement of transcription start site (TSS)-proximal (promoters) and -distal (enhancers) regulatory elements. Enhancer elements play an essential role during development and cell differentiation, while genetic alterations in these elements are a major cause of human disease. Here, we discuss recent advances in high-throughput approaches to identify and characterize enhancer elements, from the well-established massively parallel reporter assays to the recent clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9-based technologies. We discuss how these approaches contribute toward a better understanding of enhancer function in normal and pathological conditions.	AP España|D Santiago-Algarra|L Pradel|S Spicuglia
29956652	CRISPR-Cas (Cluster of Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) systems confer bacteria and archaea an adaptative immunity against phages and other invading genetic elements playing an important role in bacterial evolution. However, despite the protection they generate and high rate of horizontal transfer, less than 50% of bacterial genomes harbor a CRISPR-Cas system. As a comparison, 90% of archaea encode a CRISPR-Cas system and a bacterial genome codes for two restriction modification systems on average. This review describes CRISPR-Cas systems distribution in bacterial genomes and then details the different hypotheses put forward to explain the relative scarcity of CRISPR-Cas systems. More specifically, phage escape mechanisms, ecological factors such as phage diversity and abundance and intrinsic costs, such as maintenance or autoimmunity, are discussed. Overall, a better understanding of the downsides of encoding CRISPR-Cas systems is essential to explain their evolutionary dynamics and their relative success in different environments and clades.

29956651	From 1987 and during the following 20 years, a few research teams exploring bacteria and archea genome sequences uncover the prokaryotic adaptative immune system made of the CRISPR sequence and associated cas genes. First believed to be similar to the eukaryote RNA interference system, CRISPR-Cas turned out to be unique and of an amazing genetic complexity. The comparative studies of CRISPR arrays and of cas, and later of microbiotes metagenomes allowed to propose an evolution scenario for these systems. The results demonstrate the importance of a naturalistic approach, without a priori, for the understanding of living organisms.	C Pourcel
29952526	The bacterial CRISPR-Cas-system is an adaptive and inheritable immune system for the defense against invasive genetic elements such as viral DNA or plasmids. CRISPR-Cas immunity acts by integrating short sequences of non-self DNA in the cell’s CRISPR locus which allows the cell to recognize, to remember and to destroy the invasive element. In the last years the type-II-system CRISPR-Cas9 was developed as a powerful and universal tool for the sequence-specific modification of the genome also known as genome editing. Type-II-systems rely solely on one single protein, Cas9, and a non-coding, trans-activating RNA that leads the Cas9 protein to its target DNA. The RNA-guided molecular scissor Cas9 is predestinated to correct mutated genes in line with a gene therapy and to heal chronic diseases like HIV infections or virus-induced forms of cancer via deleting viral DNA that is integrated as a provirus in the host’s genome. In addition, catalytically inactive Cas9 variants (dCas9) fused to effector domains can be used to specifically tag genome sections, regulate gene expression and modify epigenetic markers.	L Tetsch

28038452	CRISPR/Cas9 is a novel and effective genome editing technique, but its application is not widely expanded to manipulate long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) expression. The lncRNA urothelial carcinoma-associated 1 (UCA1) is upregulated in bladder cancer and promotes the progression of bladder cancer. Here, we design gRNAs specific to UCA1 and construct CRISPR/Cas9 systems targeting UCA1. Single CRISPR/Cas9-UCA1 can effectively inhibit UCA1 expression when transfected into 5637 and T24 bladder cancer cells, while the combined transfection of the two most effective CRISPR/Cas9-UCA1s can generate more satisfied inhibitory effect. CRISPR/Cas9-UCA1s attenuate UCA1 expression via targeted genome-specific DNA cleavage, resulting in the significant inhibition of cell proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro and in vivo. The mechanisms associated with the inhibitory effect of CRISPR/Cas9-UCA1 on malignant phenotypes of bladder cancer are attributed to the induction of cell cycle arrest at G1 phase, a substantial increase of apoptosis, and an enhanced activity of MMPs. Additionally, urinary UCA1 can be used as a non-invasive diagnostic marker for bladder cancer as revealed by a meta-analysis. Collectively, our data suggest that CRISPR/Cas9 technique can be used to down-modulate lncRNA expression, and urinary UCA1 may be used as a non-invasive marker for diagnosis of bladder cancer.

28034956	Prokaryotic adaptive immunity relies on the capture of fragments of invader DNA (protospacers) followed by their recombination at a dedicated acceptor DNA locus. This integrative mechanism, called adaptation, needs both Cas1 and Cas2 proteins. Here, we studied in vitro the binding of an Escherichia coli Cas1-Cas2 complex to various protospacer and acceptor DNA molecules. We show that, to form a long-lived ternary complex containing Cas1-Cas2, the acceptor DNA must carry a CRISPR locus, and the protospacer must not contain 3΄-single-stranded overhangs longer than 5 bases. In addition, the acceptor DNA must be supercoiled. Formation of the ternary complex is synergistic, in such that the binding of Cas1-Cas2 to acceptor DNA is reinforced in the presence of a protospacer. Mutagenesis analysis at the CRISPR locus indicates that the presence in the acceptor plasmid of the palindromic motif found in CRISPR repeats drives stable ternary complex formation. Most of the mutations in this motif are deleterious even if they do not prevent cruciform structure formation. The leader sequence of the CRISPR locus is fully dispensable. These DNA binding specificities of the Cas1-Cas2 integrase are likely to play a major role in the recruitment of this enzyme at the CRISPR locus.	C Moch|M Fromant|S Blanquet|P Plateau
28034696	CRISPR-multi-locus virulence sequence typing (CRISPR-MVLST) was performed to type 92 S. Typhimurium strains isolated from humans and food sources between 1983 and 2013 in Brazil and assess the suitability of this methodology comparing it with PFGE already used for subtyping the same strains. Among the 92 S. Typhimurium strains studied, we identified 25 CRISPR1 alleles, 27 CRISPR2 alleles, 2 fimH alleles and 3 sseL alleles showing that the genetic variability is much higher in the CRISPRs loci than in the virulence genes. The CRISPR-MVLST analysis provided similar results to the PFGE previously published used to type the same set of strains, demonstrating that CRISPR-MVLST is a very efficient approach for subtyping S. Typhimurium serovar and can be used to complement and validate results obtained by the PFGE methodology.	F Almeida|MIC Medeiros|DDP Rodrigues|MW Allard|JP Falcão
28030843	The potent ability of CRISPR/Cas9 system to inhibit the expression of targeted gene is being exploited as a new class of therapeutics for a variety of diseases. However, the efficient and safe delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 into specific cell populations is still the principal challenge in the clinical development of CRISPR/Cas9 therapeutics. In this study, a flexible aptamer-liposome-CRISPR/Cas9 chimera was designed to combine efficient delivery and increased flexibility. Our chimera incorporated an RNA aptamer that specifically binds prostate cancer cells expressing the prostate-specific membrane antigen as a ligand. Cationic liposomes were linked to aptamers by the post-insertion method and were used to deliver therapeutic CRISPR/Cas9 that target the survival gene, polo-like kinase 1, in tumor cells. We demonstrate that the aptamer-liposome-CRISPR/Cas9 chimeras had a significant cell-type binding specificity and a remarkable gene silencing effect in vitro. Furthermore, silencing promoted a conspicuous regression of prostate cancer in vivo. Importantly, the approach described here provides a universal means of cell type-specific CRISPR/Cas9 delivery, which is a critical goal for the widespread therapeutic applicability of CRISPR/Cas9 or other nucleic acid drugs.

28024153	The mechanisms by which human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) avoids immune surveillance by dendritic cells (DCs), and thereby prevents protective adaptive immune responses, remain poorly understood. Here we showed that HIV-1 actively arrested antiviral immune responses by DCs, which contributed to efficient HIV-1 replication in infected individuals. We identified the RNA helicase DDX3 as an HIV-1 sensor that bound abortive HIV-1 RNA after HIV-1 infection and induced DC maturation and type I interferon responses via the signaling adaptor MAVS. Notably, HIV-1 recognition by the C-type lectin receptor DC-SIGN activated the mitotic kinase PLK1, which suppressed signaling downstream of MAVS, thereby interfering with intrinsic host defense during HIV-1 infection. Finally, we showed that PLK1-mediated suppression of DDX3-MAVS signaling was a viral strategy that accelerated HIV-1 replication in infected individuals.

28018139	Mounting evidence has called into question our understanding of the role that the central dogma of molecular biology plays in human pathology. The conventional view that elucidating the mechanisms for translating genes into proteins can account for a panoply of diseases has proven incomplete. Landmark studies point to epigenetics as a missing piece of the puzzle. However, technological limitations have hindered the study of specific roles for histone post-translational modifications, DNA modifications, and non-coding RNAs in regulation of the epigenome and chromatin structure. This feature highlights CRISPR systems, including CRISPR-Cas9, as novel tools for targeted epigenome editing. It summarizes recent developments in the field, including integration of optogenetic and functional genomic approaches to explore new therapeutic opportunities, and underscores the importance of mitigating current limitations in the field. This comprehensive, analytical assessment identifies current research gaps, forecasts future research opportunities, and argues that as epigenome editing technologies mature, overcoming critical challenges in delivery, specificity, and fidelity should clear the path to bring these technologies into the clinic.

28018138	The dynamic orchestration of gene expression is crucial for the proper differentiation, function, and adaptation of cells. In the brain, transcriptional regulation underlies the incredible diversity of neuronal cell types and contributes to the ability of neurons to adapt their function to the environment. Recently, novel methods for genome and epigenome editing have begun to revolutionize our understanding of gene regulatory mechanisms. In particular, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 system has proven to be a particularly accessible and adaptable technique for genome engineering. Here, we review the use of CRISPR/Cas9 in neurobiology and discuss how these studies have advanced understanding of nervous system development and plasticity. We cover four especially salient applications of CRISPR/Cas9: testing the consequences of enhancer mutations, tagging genes and gene products for visualization in live cells, directly activating or repressing enhancers in vivo, and manipulating the epigenome. In each case, we summarize findings from recent studies and discuss evolving adaptations of the method.	MG Yang|AE West
28017588	CRISPR loci and their associated (Cas) proteins encode a prokaryotic immune system that protects against viruses and plasmids. Upon infection, a low fraction of cells acquire short DNA sequences from the invader. These sequences (spacers) are integrated in between the repeats of the CRISPR locus and immunize the host against the matching invader. Spacers specify the targets of the CRISPR immune response through transcription into short RNA guides that direct Cas nucleases to the invading DNA molecules. Here we performed random mutagenesis of the RNA-guided Cas9 nuclease to look for variants that provide enhanced immunity against viral infection. We identified a mutation, I473F, that increases the rate of spacer acquisition by more than two orders of magnitude. Our results highlight the role of Cas9 during CRISPR immunization and provide a useful tool to study this rare process and develop it as a biotechnological application.

28008168	The recent development of CRISPR-Cas systems as easily accessible and programmable tools for genome editing and regulation is spurring a revolution in biology. Paired with the rapid expansion of reference and personalized genomic sequence information, technologies based on CRISPR-Cas are enabling nearly unlimited genetic manipulation, even in previously difficult contexts, including human cells. Although much attention has focused on the potential of CRISPR-Cas to cure Mendelian diseases, the technology also holds promise to transform the development of therapies to treat complex heritable and somatic disorders. In this Review, we discuss how CRISPR-Cas can affect the next generation of drugs by accelerating the identification and validation of high-value targets, uncovering high-confidence biomarkers and developing differentiated breakthrough therapies. We focus on the promises, pitfalls and hurdles of this revolutionary gene-editing technology, discuss key aspects of different CRISPR-Cas screening platforms and offer our perspectives on the best practices in genome engineering.

28008090	Treatments for diabetes and obesity based on enteroendocrine hormones are a focus of research interest, partly due to the successes of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) mimetic peptides in the treatment of diabetes and the correlation of altered enteroendocrine profiles with the positive metabolic outcomes of gastric bypass surgery. It is thought that simultaneous stimulation of more than one receptor might mimic the superior efficacy of the latter and dual or triple-agonist peptides are under investigation. An important step in developing multiple agonists is to establish the relative pharmacological potency and efficacy of new molecules at its different target receptors, and to optimise the balance of activities to achieve the desired treatment outcome. In a recent issue of the Biochemical Journal, Naylor et al. described how they used CRISPR technology to modulate endogenous receptor density in insulinoma cells to get the balance right for a dual incretin peptide engaging both GLP-1- and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide-receptors.

28000783	CRISPR-Cas9 is efficient enough to knock out both alleles directly by introducing out-of-frame mutations. We succeeded in making biallelic on-target frameshift mutations of the endogenous Gli3 gene; however, the GLI3 protein was expressed in all six of the established cell lines carrying homozygous out-of-frame mutations. We developed a dual-tagged expression vector and proved that illegitimate translation (ITL) was the cause of the unexpected Gli3 expression. Thus, gene expression must be examined even if designed on-target out-of-frame sequences are introduced by genome editing. In addition, it is highly recommended to pre-examine the occurrence of ITL in vitro prior to the design and construction of any genome-editing vectors. In vitro assay systems such as the dual-tagged ITL assay system developed in this study should aid the identification and elucidation of ITL-based human diseases and gene expression.

27998759	Worldwide, glioblastoma (GBM) is the most lethal and frequent intracranial tumor. Despite decades of study, the overall survival of GBM patients remains unchanged. epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) amplification and gene mutation are thought to be negatively correlated with prognosis. In this study, we used proteomics to determine that UBXN1 is a negative downstream regulator of the EGFR mutation vIII (EGFRvIII). Via bioinformatics analysis, we found that UBXN1 is a factor that can improve glioma patients' overall survival time. We also determined that the down-regulation of UBXN1 is mediated by the upregulation of H3K27me3 in the presence of EGFRvIII. Because NF-κB can be negatively regulated by UBXN1, we believe that EGFRwt/vIII activates NF-κB by suppressing UBXN1 expression. Importantly, we used the latest genomic editing tool, CRISPR/Cas9, to knockout EGFRwt/vIII on exon 17 and further proved that UBXN1 is negatively regulated by EGFRwt/vIII. Furthermore, knockout of EGFR/EGFRvIII could benefit GBM in vitro and in vivo, indicating that CRISPR/Cas9 is a promising therapeutic strategy for both EGFR amplification and EGFR mutation-bearing patients.

27997583	The CRISPR/Cas9 system is a powerful genome editing technique employed in a wide variety of organisms including recently the human malaria parasite, P. falciparum. Here we report on further improvements to the CRISPR/Cas9 transfection constructs and selection protocol to more rapidly modify the P. falciparum genome and to introduce transgenes into the parasite genome without the inclusion of drug-selectable marker genes. This method was used to stably integrate the gene encoding GFP into the P. falciparum genome under the control of promoters of three different Plasmodium genes (calmodulin, gapdh and hsp70). These genes were selected as they are highly transcribed in blood stages. We show that the three reporter parasite lines generated in this study (GFP@cam, GFP@gapdh and GFP@hsp70) have in vitro blood stage growth kinetics and drug-sensitivity profiles comparable to the parental P. falciparum (NF54) wild-type line. Both asexual and sexual blood stages of the three reporter lines expressed GFP-fluorescence with GFP@hsp70 having the highest fluorescent intensity in schizont stages as shown by flow cytometry analysis of GFP-fluorescence intensity. The improved CRISPR/Cas9 constructs/protocol will aid in the rapid generation of transgenic and modified P. falciparum parasites, including those expressing different reporters proteins under different (stage specific) promoters.

27997045	CRISPR-Cas are nucleic acid-based prokaryotic immune systems. CRISPR arrays accumulate spacers from foreign DNA and provide resistance to mobile genetic elements containing identical or similar sequences. Thus, the set of spacers present in a given bacterium can be regarded as a record of encounters of its ancestors with genetic invaders. Such records should be specific for different lineages and change with time, as earlier acquired spacers get obsolete and are lost. Here, we studied type I-E CRISPR spacers of Escherichia coli from extinct pachyderm. We find that many spacers recovered from intestines of a 42 000-year-old mammoth match spacers of present-day E. coli. Present-day CRISPR arrays can be reconstructed from palaeo sequences, indicating that the order of spacers has also been preserved. The results suggest that E. coli CRISPR arrays were not subject to intensive change through adaptive acquisition during this time.

27992415	Host proteins are essential for HIV entry and replication and can be important nonviral therapeutic targets. Large-scale RNA interference (RNAi)-based screens have identified nearly a thousand candidate host factors, but there is little agreement among studies and few factors have been validated. Here we demonstrate that a genome-wide CRISPR-based screen identifies host factors in a physiologically relevant cell system. We identify five factors, including the HIV co-receptors CD4 and CCR5, that are required for HIV infection yet are dispensable for cellular proliferation and viability. Tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase 2 (TPST2) and solute carrier family 35 member B2 (SLC35B2) function in a common pathway to sulfate CCR5 on extracellular tyrosine residues, facilitating CCR5 recognition by the HIV envelope. Activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM) mediates cell aggregation, which is required for cell-to-cell HIV transmission. We validated these pathways in primary human CD4+ T cells through Cas9-mediated knockout and antibody blockade. Our findings indicate that HIV infection and replication rely on a limited set of host-dispensable genes and suggest that these pathways can be studied for therapeutic intervention.

27992409	CRISPR from Prevotella and Francisella 1 (Cpf1) is an effector endonuclease of the class 2 CRISPR-Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-CRISPR-associated proteins) gene editing system. We developed a method for evaluating Cpf1 activity, based on target sequence composition in mammalian cells, in a high-throughput manner. A library of >11,000 target sequence and guide RNA pairs was delivered into human cells using lentiviral vectors. Subsequent delivery of Cpf1 into this cell library induced insertions and deletions (indels) at the integrated synthetic target sequences, which allowed en masse evaluation of Cpf1 activity by using deep sequencing. With this approach, we determined protospacer-adjacent motif sequences of two Cpf1 nucleases, one from Acidaminococcus sp. BV3L6 (hereafter referred to as AsCpf1) and the other from Lachnospiraceae bacterium ND2006 (hereafter referred to as LbCpf1). We also defined target-sequence-dependent activity profiles of AsCpf1, which enabled the development of a web tool that predicts the indel frequencies for given target sequences (http://big.hanyang.ac.kr/cindel). Both the Cpf1 characterization profile and the in vivo high-throughput evaluation method will greatly facilitate Cpf1-based genome editing.

27991524	Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is the most lethal form of breast cancer. All IBC patients have lymph node involvement and one-third of patients already have distant metastasis at diagnosis. This propensity for metastasis is a hallmark of IBC distinguishing it from less lethal non-inflammatory breast cancers (nIBC). Genetic profiling studies have been conducted to differentiate IBC from nIBC, but no IBC cancer-cell-specific gene signature has been identified. We hypothesized that a tumor-extrinsic factor, notably tumor-associated macrophages, promotes and contributes to IBC's extreme metastatic phenotype. To this end, we studied the effect of macrophage-conditioned media (MCM) on IBC. We show that two IBC cell lines are hyper-responsive to MCM as compared to normal-like breast and aggressive nIBC cell lines. We further interrogated IBC's hyper-responsiveness to MCM using a microfluidic migration device, which permits individual cell migration path tracing. We found the MCM "primes" the IBC cells' cellular machinery to become extremely migratory in response to a chemoattractant. We determined that interleukins -6, -8, and -10 within the MCM are sufficient to stimulate this enhanced IBC migration effect, and that the known metastatic oncogene, RhoC GTPase, is necessary for the enhanced migration response.

27989439	C2c1 is a type V-B CRISPR-Cas system dual-RNA-guided DNA endonuclease. Here, we report the crystal structure of Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris C2c1 in complex with a chimeric single-molecule guide RNA (sgRNA). AacC2c1 exhibits a bi-lobed architecture consisting of a REC and NUC lobe. The sgRNA scaffold forms a tetra-helical structure, distinct from previous predictions. The crRNA is located in the central channel of C2c1, and the tracrRNA resides in an external surface groove. Although AacC2c1 lacks a PAM-interacting domain, our analysis revealed that the PAM duplex has a similar binding position found in Cpf1. Importantly, C2c1-sgRNA system is highly sensitive to single-nucleotide mismatches between guide RNA and target DNA. The resulting reduction in off-target cleavage renders C2c1 a valuable addition to the current arsenal of genome-editing tools. Together, our findings indicate that sgRNA assembly is achieved through a mechanism distinct from that reported previously for Cas9 or Cpf1 endonucleases.	L Liu|P Chen|M Wang|X Li|J Wang|M Yin|Y Wang
27989123	The yeast Yarrowia lipolytica is a promising microbial host due to its native capacity to produce lipid-based chemicals. Engineering stable production strains requires genomic integration of modified genes, avoiding episomal expression that requires specialized media to maintain selective pressures. Here, we develop a CRISPR-Cas9-based tool for targeted, markerless gene integration into the Y. lipolytica genome. A set of genomic loci was screened to identify sites that were accepting of gene integrations without impacting cell growth. Five sites were found to meet these criteria. Expression levels from a GFP expression cassette were consistent when inserted into AXP, XPR2, A08, and D17, with reduced expression from MFE1. The standardized tool is comprised of five pairs of plasmids (one homologous donor plasmid and a CRISPR-Cas9 expression plasmid), with each pair targeting gene integration into one of the characterized sites. To demonstrate the utility of the tool we rapidly engineered a semisynthetic lycopene biosynthesis pathway by integrating four different genes at different loci. The capability to integrate multiple genes without the need for marker recovery and into sites with known expression levels will enable more rapid and reliable pathway engineering in Y. lipolytica.

27987038	Recent advances in genome editing technologies have enabled the rapid and precise manipulation of genomes, including the targeted introduction, alteration, and removal of genomic sequences. However, respective methods have been described mainly in non-differentiated or haploid cell types. Genome editing of well-differentiated renal epithelial cells has been hampered by a range of technological issues, including optimal design, efficient expression of multiple genome editing constructs, attainable mutation rates, and best screening strategies. Here, we present an easily implementable workflow for the rapid generation of targeted heterozygous and homozygous genomic sequence alterations in renal cells using transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) system. We demonstrate the versatility of established protocols by generating novel cellular models for studying autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Furthermore, we show that cell culture-validated genetic modifications can be readily applied to mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) for the generation of corresponding mouse models. The described procedure for efficient genome editing can be applied to any cell type to study physiological and pathophysiological functions in the context of precisely engineered genotypes.

27986915	Targeted genome modification by RNA-guided nucleases derived from the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated nuclease 9 (Cas9) system has seen rapid development in many organisms, including several plant species. In the present study, we succeeded in introducing the CRISPR/Cas9 system into the non-model organism Scopelophila cataractae, a moss that exhibits heavy metal tolerance, and the model organism Physcomitrella patens Utilizing the process by which moss plants regenerate from protoplasts, we conducted targeted mutagenesis by expression of single-chain guide RNA (sgRNA) and Cas9 in protoplasts. Using this method, the acquisition rate of strains exhibiting phenotypic changes associated with the target genes was approximately 45-69%, and strains with phenotypic changes exhibited various insertion and deletion mutations. In addition, we report that our method is capable of multiplex targeted mutagenesis (two independent genes) and also permits the efficient introduction of large deletions (∼3 kbp). These results demonstrate that the CRISPR/Cas9 system can be used to accelerate investigations of bryology and land plant evolution.	T Nomura|T Sakurai|Y Osakabe|K Osakabe|H Sakakibara
27986854	The CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) system protects archaea and bacteria by eliminating nucleic acid invaders in a crRNA-guided manner. The Sulfolobus islandicus type III-B Cmr-α system targets invading nucleic acid at both RNA and DNA levels and DNA targeting relies on the directional transcription of the protospacer in vivo. To gain further insight into the involved mechanism, we purified a native effector complex of III-B Cmr-α from S. islandicus and characterized it in vitro. Cmr-α cleaved RNAs complementary to crRNA present in the complex and its ssDNA destruction activity was activated by target RNA. The ssDNA cleavage required mismatches between the 5΄-tag of crRNA and the 3΄-flanking region of target RNA. An invader plasmid assay showed that mutation either in the histidine-aspartate acid (HD) domain (a quadruple mutation) or in the GGDD motif of the Cmr-2α protein resulted in attenuation of the DNA interference in vivo. However, double mutation of the HD motif only abolished the DNase activity in vitro. Furthermore, the activated Cmr-α binary complex functioned as a highly active DNase to destroy a large excess DNA substrate, which could provide a powerful means to rapidly degrade replicating viral DNA.

27984739	In this issue of Molecular Cell, Patterson et al.

27984734	In multicellular organisms, dedicated regulatory circuits control cell type diversity and responses. The crosstalk and redundancies within these circuits and substantial cellular heterogeneity pose a major research challenge. Here, we present CRISP-seq, an integrated method for massively parallel single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-pooled screens. We show that profiling the genomic perturbation and transcriptome in the same cell enables us to simultaneously elucidate the function of multiple factors and their interactions. We applied CRISP-seq to probe regulatory circuits of innate immunity. By sampling tens of thousands of perturbed cells in vitro and in mice, we identified interactions and redundancies between developmental and signaling-dependent factors. These include opposing effects of Cebpb and Irf8 in regulating the monocyte/macrophage versus dendritic cell lineages and differential functions for Rela and Stat1/2 in monocyte versus dendritic cell responses to pathogens. This study establishes CRISP-seq as a broadly applicable, comprehensive, and unbiased approach for elucidating mammalian regulatory circuits.

27984733	Functional genomics efforts face tradeoffs between number of perturbations examined and complexity of phenotypes measured. We bridge this gap with Perturb-seq, which combines droplet-based single-cell RNA-seq with a strategy for barcoding CRISPR-mediated perturbations, allowing many perturbations to be profiled in pooled format. We applied Perturb-seq to dissect the mammalian unfolded protein response (UPR) using single and combinatorial CRISPR perturbations. Two genome-scale CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screens identified genes whose repression perturbs ER homeostasis. Subjecting ∼100 hits to Perturb-seq enabled high-precision functional clustering of genes. Single-cell analyses decoupled the three UPR branches, revealed bifurcated UPR branch activation among cells subject to the same perturbation, and uncovered differential activation of the branches across hits, including an isolated feedback loop between the translocon and IRE1α. These studies provide insight into how the three sensors of ER homeostasis monitor distinct types of stress and highlight the ability of Perturb-seq to dissect complex cellular responses.

27984732	Genetic screens help infer gene function in mammalian cells, but it has remained difficult to assay complex phenotypes-such as transcriptional profiles-at scale. Here, we develop Perturb-seq, combining single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based perturbations to perform many such assays in a pool. We demonstrate Perturb-seq by analyzing 200,000 cells in immune cells and cell lines, focusing on transcription factors regulating the response of dendritic cells to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Perturb-seq accurately identifies individual gene targets, gene signatures, and cell states affected by individual perturbations and their genetic interactions. We posit new functions for regulators of differentiation, the anti-viral response, and mitochondrial function during immune activation. By decomposing many high content measurements into the effects of perturbations, their interactions, and diverse cell metadata, Perturb-seq dramatically increases the scope of pooled genomic assays.

27984090	Glioblastomas are the deadliest type of brain cancer and are frequently associated with poor prognosis and a high degree of recurrence despite removal by surgical resection and treatment by chemo- and radio-therapy. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a treatment well known to induce mainly necrotic and apoptotic cell death in solid tumors. 5-Aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA)-based PDT was recently shown to sensitize human glioblastoma cells (LN-18) to a RIP3 (Receptor Interacting Protein 3)-dependent cell death which is counter-acted by activation of autophagy. These promising results led us to investigate the pathways involved in cell death and survival mechanisms occurring in glioblastoma following PDT. In the present study, we describe a new TSC2 (Tuberous Sclerosis 2)-dependent survival pathway implicating MK2 (MAPKAPK2) kinase and 14-3-3 proteins which conducts to the activation of a pro-survival autophagy. Moreover, we characterized a new RIP3/TSC2 complex where RIP3 is suggested to promote cell death by targeting TSC2-dependent survival pathway. These results highlight (i) a new role of TSC2 to protect glioblastoma against PDT-induced cell death and (ii) TSC2 and 14-3-3 as new RIP3 partners.

27980086	The human genome produces thousands of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs)-transcripts >200 nucleotides long that do not encode proteins. Although critical roles in normal biology and disease have been revealed for a subset of lncRNAs, the function of the vast majority remains untested. We developed a CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) platform targeting 16,401 lncRNA loci in seven diverse cell lines, including six transformed cell lines and human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Large-scale screening identified 499 lncRNA loci required for robust cellular growth, of which 89% showed growth-modifying function exclusively in one cell type. We further found that lncRNA knockdown can perturb complex transcriptional networks in a cell type-specific manner. These data underscore the functional importance and cell type specificity of many lncRNAs.

27980065	CRISPR-Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and the associated genes) constitute adaptive immune systems in bacteria and archaea and they provide sequence specific immunity against foreign nucleic acids. CRISPR-Cas systems are activated by viral infection. However, little is known about how CRISPR-Cas systems are activated in response to viral infection or how their expression is controlled in the absence of viral infection. Here, we demonstrate that both the transcriptional regulator Csa3b, and the type I-A interference complex Cascade, are required to transcriptionally repress the interference gene cassette in the archaeon Sulfolobus. Csa3b binds to two palindromic repeat sites in the promoter region of the cassette and facilitates binding of the Cascade to the promoter region. Upon viral infection, loading of Cascade complexes onto crRNA-matching protospacers leads to relief of the transcriptional repression. Our data demonstrate a mechanism coupling CRISPR-Cas surveillance of protospacers to transcriptional regulation of the interference gene cassette thereby allowing a fast response to viral infection.

27978436	A population of CD4 T lymphocytes harboring latent HIV genomes can persist in patients on antiretroviral therapy, posing a barrier to HIV eradication. To examine cellular complexes controlling HIV latency, we conducted a genome-wide screen with a pooled ultracomplex shRNA library and in vitro system modeling HIV latency and identified the mTOR complex as a modulator of HIV latency. Knockdown of mTOR complex subunits or pharmacological inhibition of mTOR activity suppresses reversal of latency in various HIV-1 latency models and HIV-infected patient cells. mTOR inhibitors suppress HIV transcription both through the viral transactivator Tat and via Tat-independent mechanisms. This inhibition occurs at least in part via blocking the phosphorylation of CDK9, a p-TEFb complex member that serves as a cofactor for Tat-mediated transcription. The control of HIV latency by mTOR signaling identifies a pathway that may have significant therapeutic opportunities.

27968995	Sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) has been shown to mediate sucrose/starch ratio in plant leaves through studies of 'starch leaf' species that mainly accumulate starch in their leaves. However, the contribution of SPS to sucrose/starch ratio in rice leaves, which mainly accumulate sucrose (i.e., 'sugar leaf'), has not been confirmed due to inconsistencies in the results of previous studies. In this study, we analyzed mutant lines with reduced SPS activity, which were generated using Tos17 insertion, RNAi, and the CRISPR/Cas9 system. The knockdown and knockout mutants of OsSPS1 showed a 29-46% reduction in SPS activity in the leaves, but the carbohydrate content in the leaves and plant growth were not significantly different from those of wild-type plants. In a double knockout mutant of OsSPS1 and OsSPS11 (sps1/sps11), an 84% reduction in leaf SPS activity resulted in higher starch accumulation in the leaves than in the wild-type leaves. However, the sps1/sps11 plants grew normally, which is in contrast to the inhibited growth of SPS mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana, a typical starch leaf plant. These results suggest that SPS has a smaller effect on the sucrose/starch ratio in leaves and growth of rice than on starch leaf species.	Y Hashida|T Hirose|M Okamura|KI Hibara|R Ohsugi|N Aoki
27968730	Enhancers regulate precise spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression in eukaryotes and, moreover, evolutionary changes in these modular cis-regulatory elements may represent the predominant genetic basis for phenotypic evolution. Here, we review approaches to identify and functionally analyze enhancers and their transcription factor binding sites, including assay for transposable-accessible chromatin-sequencing (ATAC-Seq) and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9, respectively. We also explore enhancer functionality, including how transcription factor binding sites combine to regulate transcription, as well as research on shadow and super enhancers, and how enhancers can act over great distances and even in trans. Finally, we discuss recent theoretical and empirical data on how transcription factor binding sites and enhancers evolve. This includes how the function of enhancers is maintained despite the turnover of transcription factor binding sites as well as reviewing studies where mutations in enhancers have been shown to underlie morphological change.

27964731	How the pathogen Clostridium difficile might survive, evolve and be transferred between reservoirs within the natural environment is poorly understood. Some ribotypes are found both in clinical and environmental settings. Whether these strains are distinct from each another and evolve in the specific environments is not established. The possession of a highly mobile genome has contributed to the genetic diversity and ongoing evolution of C. difficile. Interpretations of genetic diversity have been limited by fragmented assemblies resulting from short-read length sequencing approaches and by a limited understanding of epigenetic regulation of diversity. To address this, single molecule real time (SMRT) sequencing was used in this study as it produces high quality genome sequences, with resolution of repeat regions (including those found in mobile elements) and can generate data to determine methylation modifications across the sequence (the methylome).	Chromosomal rearrangements and ribosomal operon duplications were observed in both genomes. The rearrangements occurred at insertion sites within two mobile genetic elements (MGEs), Tn6164 and Tn6293, present only in the M120 and CD105HS27 genomes, respectively. The gene content of these two transposons differ considerably which could impact upon horizontal gene transfer; differences include CDSs encoding methylases and a conjugative prophage only in Tn6164. To investigate mechanisms which could affect MGE transfer, the methylome, restriction modification (RM) and the CRISPR/Cas systems were characterised for each strain. Notably, the environmental isolate, CD105HS27, does not share a consensus motif for m4C methylation, but has one additional spacer when compared to the clinical isolate M120.	These findings show key differences between the two strains in terms of their genetic capacity for MGE transfer. The carriage of horizontally transferred genes appear to have genome wide effects based on two different methylation patterns. The CRISPR/Cas system appears active although perhaps slow to evolve. Data suggests that both mechanisms are functional and impact upon horizontal gene transfer and genome evolution within C. difficile.	KR Hargreaves|AM Thanki|BR Jose|MR Oggioni|MR Clokie
27956629	Dysregulated gene expression resulting from abnormal epigenetic alterations including histone acetylation and deacetylation has been demonstrated to play an important role in driving tumor growth and progression. However, the mechanisms by which specific histone deacetylases (HDACs) regulate differentiation in solid tumors remains unclear. Using pediatric rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) as a paradigm to elucidate the mechanism blocking differentiation in solid tumors, we identified HDAC3 as a major suppressor of myogenic differentiation from a high-efficiency Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based phenotypic screen of class I and II HDAC genes. Detailed characterization of the HDAC3-knockout phenotype in vitro and in vivo using a tamoxifen-inducible CRISPR targeting strategy demonstrated that HDAC3 deacetylase activity and the formation of a functional complex with nuclear receptor corepressors (NCORs) were critical in restricting differentiation in RMS. The NCOR/HDAC3 complex specifically functions by blocking myoblast determination protein 1 (MYOD1)-mediated activation of myogenic differentiation. Interestingly, there was also a transient up-regulation of growth-promoting genes upon initial HDAC3 targeting, revealing a unique cancer-specific response to the forced transition from a neoplastic state to terminal differentiation. Our study applied modifications of CRISPR/CRISPR-associated endonuclease 9 (Cas9) technology to interrogate the function of essential cancer genes and pathways and has provided insights into cancer cell adaptation in response to altered differentiation status. Because current pan-HDAC inhibitors have shown disappointing results in clinical trials of solid tumors, therapeutic targets specific to HDAC3 function represent a promising option for differentiation therapy in malignant tumors with dysregulated HDAC3 activity.

27955649	meso-Galactaric acid is a dicarboxylic acid that can be produced by the oxidation of D-galacturonic acid, the main constituent of pectin. Mould strains can be engineered to perform this oxidation by expressing the bacterial enzyme uronate dehydrogenase. In addition, the endogenous pathway for D-galacturonic acid catabolism has to be inactivated. The filamentous fungus Aspergillus niger would be a suitable strain for galactaric acid production since it is efficient in pectin hydrolysis, however, it is catabolizing the resulting galactaric acid via an unknown catabolic pathway.	In this study, a transcriptomics approach was used to identify genes involved in galactaric acid catabolism. Several genes were deleted using CRISPR/Cas9 together with in vitro synthesized sgRNA. As a result, galactaric acid catabolism was disrupted. An engineered A. niger strain combining the disrupted galactaric and D-galacturonic acid catabolism with an expression of a heterologous uronate dehydrogenase produced galactaric acid from D-galacturonic acid. The resulting strain was also converting pectin-rich biomass to galactaric acid in a consolidated bioprocess.	In the present study, we demonstrated the use of CRISPR/Cas9 mediated gene deletion technology in A. niger in an metabolic engineering application. As a result, a strain for the efficient production of galactaric acid from D-galacturonic acid was generated. The present study highlights the usefulness of CRISPR/Cas9 technology in the metabolic engineering of filamentous fungi.	J Kuivanen|YJ Wang|P Richard

27936513	In the adaptive immune systems of many bacteria and archaea, the Cas9 endonuclease forms a complex with specific guide/scaffold RNA to identify and cleave complementary target sequences in foreign DNA. This DNA targeting machinery has been exploited in numerous applications of genome editing and transcription control. However, the molecular mechanism of the Cas9 system is still obscure. Recently, high-resolution structures have been solved for Cas9 in different structural forms (e.g., unbound forms, RNA-bound binary complexes, and RNA-DNA-bound tertiary complexes, corresponding to an inactive state, a pre-target-bound state, and a cleavage-competent or product state), which offered key structural insights to the Cas9 mechanism. To further probe the structural dynamics of Cas9 interacting with RNA and DNA at the amino-acid level of details, we have performed systematic coarse-grained modeling using an elastic network model and related analyses. Our normal mode analysis predicted a few key modes of collective motions that capture the observed conformational changes featuring large domain motions triggered by binding of RNA and DNA. Our flexibility analysis identified specific regions with high or low flexibility that coincide with key functional sites (such as DNA/RNA-binding sites, nuclease cleavage sites, and key hinges). We also identified a small set of hotspot residues that control the energetics of functional motions, which overlap with known functional sites and offer promising targets for future mutagenesis efforts to improve the specificity of Cas9. Finally, we modeled the conformational transitions of Cas9 from the unbound form to the binary complex and then the tertiary complex, and predicted a distinct sequence of domain motions. In sum, our findings have offered rich structural and dynamic details relevant to the Cas9 machinery, and will guide future investigation and engineering of the Cas9 systems.

27936181	The NIH Undiagnosed Diseases Program admitted a male patient with unclassifiable late-onset ataxia-like symptoms. Exome sequencing revealed a heterozygous de novo mutation converting glycine 316 to serine in ATP1A3, which might cause disease. ATP1A3 encodes the Na+/K+ ATPase pump α3-subunit. Using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homologous recombination for genome editing, we modelled this putative disease-causing allele in Caenorhabditis elegans, recreating the patient amino acid change in eat-6, the orthologue of ATP1A3. The impact of the mutation on eat-6 function at the neuromuscular junction was examined using two behavioural assays: rate of pharyngeal pumping and sensitivity to aldicarb, a drug that causes paralysis over time via the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase. The patient allele decreased pumping rates and caused hypersensitivity to aldicarb. Animals heterozygous for the allele exhibited similar defects, whereas loss of function mutations in eat-6 were recessive. These results indicate that the mutation is dominant and impairs the neuromuscular function. Thus, we conclude that the de novo G316S mutation in ATP1A3 likely causes or contributes to patient symptoms. More broadly, we conclude that, for conserved genes, it is possible to rapidly and easily model human diseases in C. elegans using CRIPSR/Cas9 genome editing.	A Sorkaç|IC Alcantara|AC Hart
27934604	Human fibroblasts were engineered to express the CRISPR-based synergistic activation mediator (SAM) complex: dCas9-VP64 and MS2-P65-HSF1. Two induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) clones expressing SAM were established by transducing these fibroblasts with lentivirus expressing OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and C-MYC. We have validated that the reprogramming cassette is silenced in the SAM iPSC clones. Expression of pluripotency genes (OCT4, SOX2, LIN28A, NANOG, GDF3, SSEA4, and TRA-1-60), differentiation potential to all three germ layers, and normal karyotypes are validated. These SAM-iPSCs provide a novel, useful tool to investigate genetic regulation of stem cell proliferation and differentiation through CRISPR-mediated activation of endogenous genes.

27924580	Genome engineering using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR associated nuclease 9 (Cas9) technology is revolutionizing biomedical research. CRISPR-Cas9 enables precise editing of genes in a wide variety of cells and organisms, thereby accelerating molecular studies via targeted mutagenesis, epitope tagging, and other custom genetic modifications. Here, we illustrate the CRISPR-Cas9 methodology by focusing on Capicua (Cic), a nuclear transcriptional repressor directly phosphorylated and inactivated by ERK/MAPK. Specifically, we use CRISPR-Cas9 for targeting an ERK docking site of Drosophila Cic, thus generating ERK-insensitive mutants of this important signaling sensor.

27918539	We present an approach for engineering evolving DNA barcodes in living cells. A homing guide RNA (hgRNA) scaffold directs the Cas9-hgRNA complex to the DNA locus of the hgRNA itself. We show that this homing CRISPR-Cas9 system acts as an expressed genetic barcode that diversifies its sequence and that the rate of diversification can be controlled in cultured cells. We further evaluate these barcodes in cell populations and show that they can be used to record lineage history and that the barcode RNA can be amplified in situ, a prerequisite for in situ sequencing. This integrated approach will have wide-ranging applications, such as in deep lineage tracing, cellular barcoding, molecular recording, dissecting cancer biology, and connectome mapping.

27916599	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) loci and their flanking CRISPR-associated (cas) genes make up RNA-guided, adaptive immune systems in prokaryotes whose effector proteins have become powerful tools for basic research and biotechnology. While the Cas effector proteins are remarkably diverse, they commonly rely on protospacer-adjacent motifs (PAMs) as the first step in target recognition. PAM sequences are known to vary considerably between systems and have proven to be difficult to predict, spurring the need for new tools to rapidly identify and communicate these sequences. Recent advances have also shown that Cas proteins can be engineered to alter PAM recognition, opening new opportunities to develop CRISPR-based tools with enhanced targeting capabilities. In this review, we discuss the properties of the CRISPR PAM and the emerging tools for determining, visualizing, and engineering PAM recognition. We also propose a standard means of orienting the PAM to simplify how its location and sequence are communicated.	RT Leenay|CL Beisel
27914761	The vaginal microbial community is typically characterized by abundant lactobacilli. Lactobacillus iners, a fairly recently detected species, is frequently present in the vaginal niche. However, the role of this species in vaginal health is unclear, since it can be detected in normal conditions as well as during vaginal dysbiosis, such as bacterial vaginosis, a condition characterized by an abnormal increase in bacterial diversity and lack of typical lactobacilli. Compared to other Lactobacillus species, L. iners has more complex nutritional requirements and a Gram-variable morphology. L. iners has an unusually small genome (ca. 1 Mbp), indicative of a symbiotic or parasitic lifestyle, in contrast to other lactobacilli that show niche flexibility and genomes of up to 3-4 Mbp. The presence of specific L. iners genes, such as those encoding iron-sulfur proteins and unique σ-factors, reflects a high degree of niche specification. The genome of L. iners strains also encodes inerolysin, a pore-forming toxin related to vaginolysin of Gardnerella vaginalis. Possibly, this organism may have clonal variants that in some cases promote a healthy vagina, and in other cases are associated with dysbiosis and disease. Future research should examine this friend or foe relationship with the host.	MI Petrova|G Reid|M Vaneechoutte|S Lebeer
27912110	In the prokaryotic CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune systems, a CRISPR RNA (crRNA) assembles with multiple or single Cas proteins to form crRNA ribonucleoprotein (crRNP) effector complexes, responsible for the destruction of invading genetic elements. Although the mechanisms of target recognition and cleavage by the crRNP effectors are quite diverse among the different types of CRISPR-Cas systems, the basic action principles of these crRNA-guided effector nucleases are highly conserved. In all of the crRNP effectors, the repeat-derived invariant and spacer-derived variable segments of the crRNA are recognized by the Cas protein(s) in sequence-dependent and sequence-independent manners, respectively, with the spacer-derived guide segment available for base pairing with target nucleic acids. Over the past few years, intensive studies have provided an atomic view of the crRNA-guided target interference mechanisms in different types of CRISPR-Cas systems. Here, we review the recent progress toward structural and mechanistic understanding of the diverse crRNP effector nucleases.	H Nishimasu|O Nureki
27912098	The Hippo pathway is important for regulating tissue homeostasis, and its dysregulation has been implicated in human cancer. However, it is not well understood how the Hippo pathway becomes dysregulated because few mutations in core Hippo pathway components have been identified. Therefore, much work in the Hippo field has focused on identifying upstream regulators, and a complex Hippo interactome has been identified. Nevertheless, it is not always clear which components are the most physiologically relevant in regulating YAP/TAZ. To provide an overview of important Hippo pathway components, we created knockout cell lines for many of these components and compared their relative contributions to YAP/TAZ regulation in response to a wide range of physiological signals. By this approach, we provide an overview of the functional importance of many Hippo pathway components and demonstrate NF2 and RHOA as important regulators of YAP/TAZ and TAOK1/3 as direct kinases for LATS1/2.

Here we review three foundational technologies-clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs). We discuss the engineering advances that facilitated their development and highlight several achievements in genome engineering that were made possible by these tools. We also consider artificial transcription factors, illustrating how this technology can complement targeted nucleases for synthetic biology and gene therapy.	T Gaj|SJ Sirk|SL Shui|J Liu
27908280	Microbial genome editing is a powerful tool to modify chromosome in way of deletion, insertion or replacement, which is one of the most important techniques in metabolic engineering research. The emergence of CRISPR/Cas9 technique inspires various genomic editing methods.	In this research, the goal of development of a fast and easy method for Escherichia coli genome editing with high efficiency is pursued. For this purpose, we designed modular plasmid assembly strategy, compared effects of different length of homologous arms for recombination, and tested different sets of recombinases. The final technique we developed only requires one plasmid construction and one transformation of practice to edit a genomic locus with 3 days and minimal lab work. In addition, the single temperature sensitive plasmid is easy to eliminate for another round of editing. Especially, process of the modularized editing plasmid construction only takes 4 h.	In this study, we developed a fast and easy genome editing procedure based on CRISPR/Cas9 system that only required the work of one plasmid construction and one transformation, which allowed modification of a chromosome locus within 3 days and could be performed continuously for multiple loci.

27905217	The goal of editing the genomes of stem cells to generate model organisms and cell lines for genetic and biological studies has been pursued for decades. There is also exciting potential for future clinical impact in humans. While recent, rapid advances in targeted nuclease technologies have led to unprecedented accessibility and ease of gene editing, biology has benefited from past directed gene modification via homologous recombination, gene traps and other transgenic methodologies. Here we review the history of genome editing in stem cells (including via zinc finger nucleases, transcription activator-like effector nucleases and CRISPR-Cas9), discuss recent developments leading to the implementation of stem cell gene therapies in clinical trials and consider the prospects for future advances in this rapidly evolving field.

27900888	The CRISPR/Cas system can be used to simply and efficiently edit the genomes of various species, including animals, plants, and microbes. Zymomonas mobilis ZM4 is a highly efficient, ethanol-producing bacterium that contains five native plasmids. Here, we constructed the pSUZM2a-Cas9 plasmid and a single-guide RNA expression plasmid. The pSUZM2a-Cas9 plasmid was used to express the Cas9 gene cloned from Streptococcus pyogenes CICC 10464. The single-guide RNA expression plasmid pUC-T7sgRNA, with a T7 promoter, can be used for the in vitro synthesis of single-guide RNAs. This system was successfully employed to knockout the upp gene of Escherichia coli and the replicase genes of native Z. mobilis plasmids. This is the first study to apply the CRISPR/Cas9 system of S. pyogenes to eliminate native plasmids in Z. mobilis. It provides a new method for plasmid curing and paves the way for the genomic engineering of Z. mobilis.	QH Cao|HH Shao|H Qiu|T Li|YZ Zhang|XM Tan
27899650	Despite the extensive use of Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a platform for synthetic biology, strain engineering remains slow and laborious. Here, we employ CRISPR/Cas9 technology to build a cloning-free toolkit that addresses commonly encountered obstacles in metabolic engineering, including chromosomal integration locus and promoter selection, as well as protein localization and solubility. The toolkit includes 23 Cas9-sgRNA plasmids, 37 promoters of various strengths and temporal expression profiles, and 10 protein-localization, degradation and solubility tags. We facilitated the use of these parts via a web-based tool, that automates the generation of DNA fragments for integration. Our system builds upon existing gene editing methods in the thoroughness with which the parts are standardized and characterized, the types and number of parts available and the ease with which our methodology can be used to perform genetic edits in yeast. We demonstrated the applicability of this toolkit by optimizing the expression of a challenging but industrially important enzyme, taxadiene synthase (TXS). This approach enabled us to diagnose an issue with TXS solubility, the resolution of which yielded a 25-fold improvement in taxadiene production.

27899566	CRISPR-Cas system epitomizes prokaryote-specific quintessential adaptive defense machinery that limits the genome invasion of mobile genetic elements. It confers adaptive immunity to bacteria by capturing a protospacer fragment from invading foreign DNA, which is later inserted into the leader proximal end of CRIPSR array and serves as immunological memory to recognize recurrent invasions. The universally conserved Cas1 and Cas2 form an integration complex that is known to mediate the protospacer invasion into the CRISPR array. However, the mechanism by which this protospacer fragment gets integrated in a directional fashion into the leader proximal end is elusive. Here, we employ CRISPR/dCas9 mediated immunoprecipitation and genetic analysis to identify Integration Host Factor (IHF) as an indispensable accessory factor for spacer acquisition in Escherichia coli Further, we show that the leader region abutting the first CRISPR repeat localizes IHF and Cas1-2 complex. IHF binding to the leader region induces bending by about 120° that in turn engenders the regeneration of the cognate binding site for protospacer bound Cas1-2 complex and brings it in proximity with the first CRISPR repeat. This appears to guide Cas1-2 complex to orient the protospacer invasion towards the leader-repeat junction thus driving the integration in a polarized fashion.

27899508	Inducible loss of gene function experiments are necessary to uncover mechanisms underlying development, physiology and disease. However, current methods are complex, lack robustness and do not work in multiple cell types. Here we address these limitations by developing single-step optimized inducible gene knockdown or knockout (sOPTiKD or sOPTiKO) platforms. These are based on genetic engineering of human genomic safe harbors combined with an improved tetracycline-inducible system and CRISPR/Cas9 technology. We exemplify the efficacy of these methods in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), and show that generation of sOPTiKD/KO hPSCs is simple, rapid and allows tightly controlled individual or multiplexed gene knockdown or knockout in hPSCs and in a wide variety of differentiated cells. Finally, we illustrate the general applicability of this approach by investigating the function of transcription factors (OCT4 and T), cell cycle regulators (cyclin D family members) and epigenetic modifiers (DPY30). Overall, sOPTiKD and sOPTiKO provide a unique opportunity for functional analyses in multiple cell types relevant for the study of human development.

27896535	Generating transgenic and gene edited mammals involves in vitro manipulation of oocytes or single cell embryos. Due to the comparative inaccessibility of avian oocytes and single cell embryos, novel protocols have been developed to produce transgenic and gene edited birds. While these protocols are relatively efficient, they involve two generation intervals before reaching complete somatic and germline expressing transgenic or gene edited birds. Most of this work has been done with chickens, and many protocols require in vitro culturing of primordial germ cells (PGCs). However, for many other bird species no methodology for long term culture of PGCs exists. Developing methodologies to produce germline transgenic or gene edited birds in the first generation would save significant amounts of time and resource. Furthermore, developing protocols that can be readily adapted to a wide variety of avian species would open up new research opportunities. Here we report a method using sperm as a delivery mechanism for gene editing vectors which we call sperm transfection assisted gene editing (STAGE). We have successfully used this method to generate GFP knockout embryos and chickens, as well as generate embryos with mutations in the doublesex and mab-3 related transcription factor 1 (DMRT1) gene using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. The efficiency of the method varies from as low as 0% to as high as 26% with multiple factors such as CRISPR guide efficiency and mRNA stability likely impacting the outcome. This straightforward methodology could simplify gene editing in many bird species including those for which no methodology currently exists.

27895273	Reducing the incidence of malaria has been a public health priority for nearly a century. New technologies and associated vector control strategies play an important role in the prospect of sustained reductions. The development of the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system has generated new possibilities for the use of gene-drive constructs to reduce or alter vector populations to reduce malaria incidence. However, before these technologies can be developed and exploited, it will be necessary to understand and assess the likelihood of any potential harms to humans or the environment. To begin this process, the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health and the International Life Sciences Institute Research Foundation organized an expert workshop to consider the potential risks related to the use of gene drives in Anopheles gambiae for malaria control in Africa. The resulting discussion yielded a series of consensus points that are reported here.	A Roberts|PP Andrade|F Okumu|H Quemada|M Savadogo|JA Singh|S James
27894274	Although CRISPR/Cas enables one-step gene cassette knock-in, assembling targeting vectors containing long homology arms is a laborious process for high-throughput knock-in. We recently developed the CRISPR/Cas-based precise integration into the target chromosome (PITCh) system for a gene cassette knock-in without long homology arms mediated by microhomology-mediated end-joining.	Here, we identified exonuclease 1 (Exo1) as an enhancer for PITCh in human cells. By combining the Exo1 and PITCh-directed donor vectors, we achieved convenient one-step knock-in of gene cassettes and floxed allele both in human cells and mouse zygotes.	Our results provide a technical platform for high-throughput knock-in.	T Aida|S Nakade|T Sakuma|Y Izu|A Oishi|K Mochida|H Ishikubo|T Usami|H Aizawa|T Yamamoto|K Tanaka

27890617	CRISPR/Cas9 has been widely used for genomic editing in many organisms. Many human diseases are caused by multiple mutations. The CRISPR/Cas9 system provides a potential tool to introduce multiple mutations in a genome. To mimic complicated genomic variants in human diseases, such as multiple gene deletions or mutations, two or more small guide RNAs (sgRNAs) need to be introduced all together. This can be achieved by separate Pol III promoters in a construct. However, limited enzyme sites and increased insertion size lower the efficiency to make a construct. Here, we report a strategy to quickly assembly multiple sgRNAs in one construct using a polycistronic-tRNA-gRNA (PTG) strategy. Taking advantage of the endogenous tRNA processing system in mammalian cells, we efficiently express multiple sgRNAs driven using only one Pol III promoter. Using an all-in-one construct carrying PTG, we disrupt the deacetylase domain in multiple histone deacetylases (HDACs) in human cells simultaneously. We demonstrate that multiple HDAC deletions significantly affect the activation of the Wnt-signaling pathway. Thus, this method enables to efficiently target multiple genes and provide a useful tool to establish mutated cells mimicking human diseases.	F Dong|K Xie|Y Chen|Y Yang|Y Mao
27881475	Prokaryotes and eukaryotes evolved relatively similar RNA-based molecular mechanisms to fight potentially deleterious nucleic acids coming from phages, transposons, or viruses. Short RNAs guide effector complexes toward their targets to be silenced or eliminated. These short immunity RNAs are transcribed from clustered loci. Unexpectedly and strikingly, bacterial and eukaryotic immunity RNA clusters share substantial functional and mechanistic resemblances in fighting nucleic acid intruders.	B Felden|L Paillard
27875019	CRISPR-Cpf1 is a newly identified CRISPR-Cas system, and Cpf1 was recently engineered as a molecular tool for targeted genome editing in mammalian cells. To test whether the engineered CRISPR-Cpf1 system could induce the production of rice mutants, we selected two genome targets in the OsPDS and OsBEL genes. Our results show that both targets could be efficiently mutated in transgenic rice plants using CRISPR-Cpf1. We found that pre-crRNAs with a full-length direct repeat sequence exhibited considerably increased efficiencies compared with mature crRNAs. In addition, the specificity and transmission of the mutation were investigated, and the behaviours of crRNA-Cpf1-induced plant targeted genome mutagenesis were assessed. Taken together, our results indicate that CRISPR-Cpf1 expression via stable transformation can efficiently generate specific and heritable targeted mutations in rice and thereby constitutes a novel and important approach to specific and precise plant genome editing.

27872965	The implementation of a knowledge-based bioeconomy requires the rapid development of highly efficient microbial production strains that are able to convert renewable carbon sources to value-added products, such as bulk and fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, or proteins at industrial scale. Starting from classical strain breeding by random mutagenesis and screening in the 1950s via rational design by metabolic engineering initiated in the 1970s, a range of powerful new technologies have been developed in the past two decades that can revolutionize future strain engineering. In particular, next-generation sequencing technologies combined with new methods of genome engineering and high-throughput screening based on genetically encoded biosensors have allowed for new concepts. In this chapter, selected new technologies relevant for breeding microbial production strains with a special emphasis on amino acid producers will be summarized.	M Bott|L Eggeling
27869803	Forward genetic screens with CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing enable high-resolution detection of genetic vulnerabilities in cancer cells. We conducted genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screens in RNF43-mutant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells, which rely on Wnt signaling for proliferation. Through these screens, we discovered a unique requirement for a Wnt signaling circuit: engaging FZD5, one of the ten Frizzled receptors encoded in the human genome. Our results uncover an underappreciated level of context-dependent specificity at the Wnt receptor level. We further derived a panel of recombinant antibodies that reports the expression of nine FZD proteins and confirms that FZD5 functional specificity cannot be explained by protein expression patterns. Additionally, antibodies that specifically bind FZD5 and FZD8 robustly inhibited the growth of RNF43-mutant PDAC cells grown in vitro and as xenografts in vivo, providing orthogonal support for the functional specificity observed genetically. Proliferation of a patient-derived PDAC cell line harboring an RNF43 variant was also selectively inhibited by the FZD5 antibodies, further demonstrating their use as a potential targeted therapy. Tumor organoid cultures from colorectal carcinoma patients that carried RNF43 mutations were also sensitive to the FZD5 antibodies, highlighting the potential generalizability of these findings beyond PDAC. Our results show that CRIPSR-based genetic screens can be leveraged to identify and validate cell surface targets for antibody development and therapy.

27867047	Campylobacter fetus is a Gram-negative, microaerophilic bacterium that infects animals and humans. The subspecies Campylobacter fetus subsp. fetus (Cff) affects a broad range of vertebrate hosts and induces abortion in cows and sheep. Campylobacter fetus subsp. venerealis (Cfv) is restricted to cattle and causes the endemic disease bovine genital campylobacteriosis, which triggers reproductive problems and is responsible for major economic losses. Campylobacter fetus subsp. testudinum (Cft) has been isolated mostly from apparently healthy reptiles belonging to different species but also from ill snakes and humans. Genotypic differentiation of Cff and Cfv is difficult, and epidemiological information is scarce because there are few methods to study the genetic diversity of the strains. We analyze the efficacy of MLST, ribosomal sequences (23S gene and internal spacer region), and CRISPRs to assess the genetic variability of C. fetus in bovine and human isolates. Sequences retrieved from complete genomes were included in the analysis for comparative purposes. MLST and ribosomal sequences had scarce or null variability, while the CRISPR-cas system structure and the sequence of CRISPR1 locus showed remarkable diversity. None of the sequences here analyzed provided evidence of a genetic differentiation of Cff and Cfv in bovine isolates. Comparison of bovine and human isolates with Cft strains showed a striking divergence. Inter-host differences raise the possibility of determining the original host of human infections using CRISPR sequences. CRISPRs are the most variable sequences analyzed in C. fetus so far, and constitute excellent representatives of a dynamic fraction of the genome. CRISPR typing is a promising tool to characterize isolates and to track the source and transmission route of C. fetus infections.

27867010	Bacteria commonly exist in high cell density populations, making them prone to viral predation and horizontal gene transfer (HGT) through transformation and conjugation. To combat these invaders, bacteria possess an arsenal of defenses, such as CRISPR-Cas adaptive immunity. Many bacterial populations coordinate their behavior as cell density increases, using quorum sensing (QS) signaling. In this study, we demonstrate that QS regulation results in increased expression of the type I-E, I-F, and III-A CRISPR-Cas systems in Serratia cells in high-density populations. Strains unable to communicate via QS were less effective at defending against invaders targeted by any of the three CRISPR-Cas systems. Additionally, the acquisition of immunity by the type I-E and I-F systems was impaired in the absence of QS signaling. We propose that bacteria can use chemical communication to modulate the balance between community-level defense requirements in high cell density populations and host fitness costs of basal CRISPR-Cas activity.

27865852	The advent of site-specific nucleases, particularly CRISPR/Cas9, provides researchers with the unprecedented ability to manipulate genomic sequences. These nucleases are used to create model cell lines, engineer metabolic pathways, produce transgenic animals and plants, perform genome-wide functional screen and, most importantly, treat human diseases that are difficult to tackle by traditional medications. Considerable efforts have been devoted to improving the efficiency and specificity of nucleases for clinical applications. However, safe and efficient delivery methods remain the major obstacle for therapeutic gene editing. In this review, we summarize the recent progress on nuclease delivery methods, highlight their impact on the outcomes of gene editing and discuss the potential of different delivery approaches for therapeutic gene editing.

27861979	Proteins of the cryptochrome/photolyase family (CPF) exhibit sequence and structural conservation, but their functions are divergent. Photolyase is a DNA repair enzyme that catalyzes the light-dependent repair of ultraviolet (UV)-induced photoproducts, whereas cryptochrome acts as a photoreceptor or circadian clock protein. Two types of DNA photolyase exist: CPD photolyase, which repairs cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs), and 6-4 photolyase, which repairs 6-4 pyrimidine-pyrimidone photoproducts (6-4PPs). Although the Cry-DASH protein is classified as a cryptochrome, it also has light-dependent DNA repair activity. To determine the significance of the three light-dependent repair enzymes in recovering from solar UV-induced DNA damage at the organismal level, we generated mutants in each gene in medaka using the CRISPR genome editing technique. The light-dependent repair activity of the mutants was examined in vitro in cultured cells and in vivo in skin tissue. Light-dependent repair of CPD was lost in the CPD photolyase-deficient mutant, whereas weak repair activity against 6-4PPs persisted in the 6-4 photolyase-deficient mutant. These results suggest the existence of a heretofore unknown 6-4PP repair pathway and thus improve our understanding of the mechanisms of defense against solar UV in vertebrates.

27855263	An effective approach to HIV cure will almost certainly require a combination of strategies, including some means of reducing the latent HIV reservoir. Because the integrated HIV provirus represents the major source of viral persistence and reactivation, one attractive approach is the direct targeting of provirus for disruption or excision using targeted endonucleases, such as CRISPR/Cas9, zinc finger nucleases, TAL effector nucleases, or meganucleases (homing endonucleases). This article highlights some of the challenges for successful endonuclease therapy for HIV, including optimization of enzyme activity and specificity, the possible emergence of viral resistance, and most importantly, efficient in vivo delivery of the enzymes to a sufficient portion of the latent reservoir.

27849583	CRISPR-Cas are prokaryotic adaptive immune systems that provide protection against bacteriophage (phage) and other parasites. Little is known about how CRISPR-Cas systems are regulated, preventing prediction of phage dynamics in nature and manipulation of phage resistance in clinical settings. Here, we show that the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 uses the cell-cell communication process, called quorum sensing, to activate cas gene expression, to increase CRISPR-Cas targeting of foreign DNA, and to promote CRISPR adaptation, all at high cell density. This regulatory mechanism ensures maximum CRISPR-Cas function when bacterial populations are at highest risk for phage infection. We demonstrate that CRISPR-Cas activity and acquisition of resistance can be modulated by administration of pro- and antiquorum-sensing compounds. We propose that quorum-sensing inhibitors could be used to suppress the CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune system to enhance medical applications, including phage therapies.

27847153	CRISPR/Cas9 is a precision-guided munition found in bacteria to fight against invading viruses. This technology has enormous potential applications, including altering genes in both somatic and germ cells, as well as generating knockout animals. Compared to other gene editing techniques such as zinc finger nucleases and TALENS, CRISPR/Cas9 is much easier to use and highly efficient. Importantly, the multiplex capacity of this technology allows multiple genes to be edited simultaneously. CRISPR/Cas9 also has the potential to prevent and cure human diseases. In this review, we wish to highlight some key points regarding the future prospect of using CRISPR/Cas9 as a powerful tool for cardiovascular research, and as a novel therapeutic strategy to treat cardiovascular diseases.

27846887	Cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 holds promise for biochemical conversion, but gene deletion in PCC 7942 is time-consuming and may be lethal to cells. CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) is an emerging technology that exploits the catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9) and single guide RNA (sgRNA) to repress sequence-specific genes without the need of gene knockout, and is repurposed to rewire metabolic networks in various procaryotic cells.	To employ CRISPRi for the manipulation of gene network in PCC 7942, we integrated the cassettes expressing enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP), dCas9 and sgRNA targeting different regions on eyfp into the PCC 7942 chromosome. Co-expression of dCas9 and sgRNA conferred effective and stable suppression of EYFP production at efficiencies exceeding 99%, without impairing cell growth. We next integrated the dCas9 and sgRNA targeting endogenous genes essential for glycogen accumulation (glgc) and succinate conversion to fumarate (sdhA and sdhB). Transcription levels of glgc, sdhA and sdhB were effectively suppressed with efficiencies depending on the sgRNA binding site. Targeted suppression of glgc reduced the expression to 6.2%, attenuated the glycogen accumulation to 4.8% and significantly enhanced the succinate titer. Targeting sdhA or sdhB also effectively downregulated the gene expression and enhanced the succinate titer ≈12.5-fold to ≈0.58-0.63 mg/L.	These data demonstrated that CRISPRi-mediated gene suppression allowed for re-directing the cellular carbon flow, thus paving a new avenue to rationally fine-tune the metabolic pathways in PCC 7942 for the production of biotechnological products.

27845624	Colorectal cancer (CRC) organoids can be derived from almost all CRC patients and therefore capture the genetic diversity of this disease. We assembled a panel of CRC organoids carrying either wild-type or mutant RAS, as well as normal organoids and tumor organoids with a CRISPR-introduced oncogenic KRAS mutation. Using this panel, we evaluated RAS pathway inhibitors and drug combinations that are currently in clinical trial for RAS mutant cancers. Presence of mutant RAS correlated strongly with resistance to these targeted therapies. This was observed in tumorigenic as well as in normal organoids. Moreover, dual inhibition of the EGFR-MEK-ERK pathway in RAS mutant organoids induced a transient cell-cycle arrest rather than cell death. In vivo drug response of xenotransplanted RAS mutant organoids confirmed this growth arrest upon pan-HER/MEK combination therapy. Altogether, our studies demonstrate the potential of patient-derived CRC organoid libraries in evaluating inhibitors and drug combinations in a preclinical setting.

27845364	Cholera is a devastating diarrhoeal disease caused by certain strains of serogroup O1/O139 Vibrio cholerae. Mobile genetic elements such as genomic islands (GIs) have been pivotal in the evolution of O1/O139 V. cholerae. Perhaps the most important GI involved in cholera disease is the V. cholerae pathogenicity island 1 (VPI-1). This GI contains the toxin-coregulated pilus (TCP) gene cluster that is necessary for colonization of the human intestine as well as being the receptor for infection by the cholera-toxin bearing CTX phage. In this study, we report a GI (designated GIVchS12) from a non-O1/O139 strain of V. cholerae that is present in the same chromosomal location as VPI-1, contains an integrase gene with 94% nucleotide and 100% protein identity to the VPI-1 integrase, and attachment (att) sites 100% identical to those found in VPI-1. However, instead of TCP and the other accessory genes present in VPI-1, GIVchS12 contains a CRISPR-Cas element and a type VI secretion system (T6SS). GIs similar to GIVchS12 were identified in other V. cholerae genomes, also containing CRISPR-Cas elements and/or T6SS's. This study highlights the diversity of GIs circulating in natural V. cholerae populations and identifies GIs with VPI-1 recombination characteristics as a propagator of CRISPR-Cas and T6SS modules.

27842490	The bacterial CRISPR system is fast becoming the most popular genetic and epigenetic engineering tool due to its universal applicability and adaptability. The desire to deploy CRISPR-based methods in a large variety of species and contexts has created an urgent need for the development of easy, time- and cost-effective methods enabling large-scale screening approaches.	Here we describe CORALINA (comprehensive gRNA library generation through controlled nuclease activity), a method for the generation of comprehensive gRNA libraries for CRISPR-based screens. CORALINA gRNA libraries can be derived from any source of DNA without the need of complex oligonucleotide synthesis. We show the utility of CORALINA for human and mouse genomic DNA, its reproducibility in covering the most relevant genomic features including regulatory, coding and non-coding sequences and confirm the functionality of CORALINA generated gRNAs.	The simplicity and cost-effectiveness make CORALINA suitable for any experimental system. The unprecedented sequence complexities obtainable with CORALINA libraries are a necessary pre-requisite for less biased large scale genomic and epigenomic screens.

27842362	The CRISPR-associated endonuclease Cas9 can edit particular genomic loci directed by a single guide RNA (gRNA). The CRISPR/Cas9 system has been successfully employed for editing genomes of various organisms. Here we describe a protocol for editing the vaccinia virus (VV) genome in the cytoplasm of VV-infected CV-1 cells using the RNA-guided Cas9. RNA-guided Cas9 induces double-stranded DNA breaks facilitating homologous recombination efficiently and specifically in the targeted site of VV and a transgene can be incorporated into these sites by homologous recombination. By using a site-specific homologous vector with transgene(s), a N1L gene-deleted VV with the red fluorescence protein (RFP) gene incorporated in this region was generated with a successful recombination efficiency 10 times greater than that obtained from the conventional homologous recombination method. This protocol demonstrates successful use of RNA-guided Cas9 system to generate mutant VVs with enhanced efficiency.	M Yuan|P Wang|LS Chard|NR Lemoine|Y Wang
27840399	Clustered regulatory interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) in association with CRISPR-associated protein (Cas) is an adaptive immune system, playing a pivotal role in the defense of bacteria and archaea. Ease of handling and cost effectiveness make the CRISPR-Cas system an ideal programmable nuclease tool. Recent advances in understanding the CRISPR-Cas system have tremendously improved its efficiency. For instance, it is possible to recapitulate the chronicle CRISPR-Cas from its infancy and inaugurate a developed version by generating novel variants of Cas proteins, subduing off-target effects, and optimizing of innovative strategies. In summary, the CRISPR-Cas system could be employed in a number of applications, including providing model systems, rectification of detrimental mutations, and antiviral therapies.

27831749	Cronobacter sakazakii sequence types 1, 4, 8 and 12 are associated with outbreaks of neonatal meningitis and necrotizing enterocolitis infections. However clonality results in strains which are indistinguishable using conventional methods. This study investigated the use of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-cas loci profiling for epidemiological investigations.	Seventy whole genomes of C. sakazakii strains from four clonal complexes which were widely distributed temporally, geographically and origin of source were profiled.	All strains encoded the same type I-E subtype CRISPR-cas system with a total of 12 different CRISPR spacer arrays. This study demonstrated the greater discriminatory power of CRISPR spacer array profiling compared with multilocus sequence typing, which will be of use in source attribution during Cronobacter outbreak investigations.

27825983	Patients diagnosed with glioblastoma (GBM) continue to face a bleak prognosis. It is critical that new effective therapeutic strategies are developed. GBM stem cells have molecular hallmarks of neural stem and progenitor cells and it is possible to propagate both non-transformed normal neural stem cells and GBM stem cells, in defined, feeder-free, adherent culture. These primary stem cell lines provide an experimental model that is ideally suited to cell-based drug discovery or genetic screens in order to identify tumour-specific vulnerabilities. For many solid tumours, including GBM, the genetic disruptions that drive tumour initiation and growth have now been catalogued. CRISPR/Cas-based genome editing technologies have recently emerged, transforming our ability to functionally annotate the human genome. Genome editing opens prospects for engineering precise genetic changes in normal and GBM-derived neural stem cells, which will provide more defined and reliable genetic models, with critical matched pairs of isogenic cell lines. Generation of more complex alleles such as knock in tags or fluorescent reporters is also now possible. These new cellular models can be deployed in cell-based phenotypic drug discovery (PDD). Here we discuss the convergence of these advanced technologies (iPS cells, neural stem cell culture, genome editing and high content phenotypic screening) and how they herald a new era in human cellular genetics that should have a major impact in accelerating glioblastoma drug discovery.

27815036	With the discovery of the CRISPR/Cas9 technology, genome editing could be performed in a rapid, precise and effective manner. Its potential applications in functional interrogation of cancer-causing genes and cancer therapy have been extensively explored. In this study, we demonstrated the use of the CRISPR/Cas9 system to directly target the oncogene HER2. Directing Cas9 to exons of the HER2 gene inhibited cell growth in breast cancer cell lines that harbor amplification of the HER2 locus. The inhibitory effect was potentiated with the addition of PARP inhibitors. Unexpectedly, CRISPR-induced mutations did not significantly affect the level of HER2 protein expression. Instead, CRISPR targeting appeared to exert its effect through a dominant negative mutation. This HER2 mutant interfered with the MAPK/ERK axis of HER2 downstream signaling. Our work provides a novel mechanism underlying the anti-cancer effects of HER2-targeting by CRISPR/Cas9, which is distinct from the clinical drug Herceptin. In addition, it opens up the possibility that incomplete CRISPR targeting of certain oncogenes could still have therapeutic value by generation of dominant negative mutants.	H Wang|W Sun
27814687	The emergence and prevalence of multidrug resistant (MDR) pathogenic bacteria poses a serious threat to human and animal health globally. Nosocomial infections and common ailments such as pneumonia, wound, urinary tract, and bloodstream infections are becoming more challenging to treat due to the rapid spread of MDR pathogenic bacteria. According to recent reports by the World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there is an unprecedented increase in the occurrence of MDR infections worldwide. The rise in these infections has generated an economic strain worldwide, prompting the WHO to endorse a global action plan to improve awareness and understanding of antimicrobial resistance. This health crisis necessitates an immediate action to target the underlying mechanisms of drug resistance in bacteria.	The advent of new bacterial genome engineering and synthetic biology (SB) tools is providing promising diagnostic and treatment plans to monitor and treat widespread recalcitrant bacterial infections. Key advances in genetic engineering approaches can successfully aid in targeting and editing pathogenic bacterial genomes for understanding and mitigating drug resistance mechanisms. In this review, we discuss the application of specific genome engineering and SB methods such as recombineering, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR), and bacterial cell-cell signaling mechanisms for pathogen targeting. The utility of these tools in developing antibacterial strategies such as novel antibiotic production, phage therapy, diagnostics and vaccine production to name a few, are also highlighted.	The prevalent use of antibiotics and the spread of MDR bacteria raise the prospect of a post-antibiotic era, which underscores the need for developing novel therapeutics to target MDR pathogens. The development of enabling SB technologies offers promising solutions to deliver safe and effective antibacterial therapies.	M Krishnamurthy|RT Moore|S Rajamani|RG Panchal

27808171	Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) can display de novo or acquired resistance to cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C), a primary component of induction chemotherapy. To identify genes capable of independently imposing Ara-C resistance, we applied a genome-wide CRISPR library to human U937 cells and exposed to them to Ara-C. Interestingly, all drug resistant clones contained guide RNAs for DCK. To avoid DCK gene modification, gRNA resistant DCK cDNA was created by the introduction of silent mutations. The CRISPR screening was repeated using the gRNA resistant DCK, and loss of SLC29A was identified as also being capable of conveying Ara-C drug resistance. To determine if loss of Dck results in increased sensitivity to other drugs, we conducted a screen of 446 FDA approved drugs using two Dck-defective BXH-2 derived murine AML cell lines and their Ara-C sensitive parental lines. Both cell lines showed an increase in sensitivity to prednisolone. Guide RNA resistant cDNA rescue was a legitimate strategy and multiple DCK or SLC29A deficient human cell clones were established with one clone becoming prednisolone sensitive. Dck-defective leukemic cells may become prednisolone sensitive indicating prednisolone may be an effective adjuvant therapy in some cases of DCK-negative AML.

27807834	Fluorescent reporter and epitope-tagged human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) greatly facilitate studies on the pluripotency and differentiation characteristics of these cells. Unfortunately traditional procedures to generate such lines are hampered by a low targeting efficiency that necessitates a lengthy process of selection followed by the removal of the selection cassette. Here we describe a procedure to generate fluorescent reporter and epitope tagged hPSCs in an efficient one-step process using the CRISPR/Cas technology. Although the method described uses our recently developed iCRISPR platform, the protocols can be adapted for general use with CRISPR/Cas or other engineered nucleases. The transfection procedures described could also be used for additional applications, such as overexpression or lineage tracing studies.	N Verma|Z Zhu|D Huangfu
27807677	The next-generation sequencing identifies a growing number of candidate genes associated with human genetic diseases, which inevitably requires efficient methods to validate the causal links between genotype and phenotype. Recently, zebrafish, with sufficiently high-throughput capabilities, has become a favored option to study human pathogenesis. In addition, CRISPR/Cas9-based approaches have radically reduced the efforts to introduce targeted genome engineering in various organisms. Here, we systemically review the basic considerations in the design of gene editing in zebrafish with CRISPR/Cas9, and explore the potential of the combination of these two to support efficient functional analysis of human genetic variants.

27702987	The HOIP ubiquitin E3 ligase generates linear ubiquitin chains by forming a complex with HOIL-1L and SHARPIN in mammals. Here, we provide the first evidence of linear ubiquitination induced by a HOIP orthologue in Drosophila We identify Drosophila CG11321, which we named Linear Ubiquitin E3 ligase (LUBEL), and find that it catalyzes linear ubiquitination in vitro We detect endogenous linear ubiquitin chain-derived peptides by mass spectrometry in Drosophila Schneider 2 cells and adult flies. Furthermore, using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we establish linear ubiquitination-defective flies by mutating residues essential for the catalytic activity of LUBEL Linear ubiquitination signals accumulate upon heat shock in flies. Interestingly, flies with LUBEL mutations display reduced survival and climbing defects upon heat shock, which is also observed upon specific LUBEL depletion in muscle. Thus, LUBEL is involved in the heat response by controlling linear ubiquitination in flies.

27661255	We recently found that nucleosomes directly block access of CRISPR/Cas9 to DNA (Horlbeck et al., 2016). Here, we build on this observation with a comprehensive algorithm that incorporates chromatin, position, and sequence features to accurately predict highly effective single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) for targeting nuclease-dead Cas9-mediated transcriptional repression (CRISPRi) and activation (CRISPRa). We use this algorithm to design next-generation genome-scale CRISPRi and CRISPRa libraries targeting human and mouse genomes. A CRISPRi screen for essential genes in K562 cells demonstrates that the large majority of sgRNAs are highly active. We also find CRISPRi does not exhibit any detectable non-specific toxicity recently observed with CRISPR nuclease approaches. Precision-recall analysis shows that we detect over 90% of essential genes with minimal false positives using a compact 5 sgRNA/gene library. Our results establish CRISPRi and CRISPRa as premier tools for loss- or gain-of-function studies and provide a general strategy for identifying Cas9 target sites.

27802138	Skeletal muscles arise from diverse embryonic origins in vertebrates, yet converge on extensively shared regulatory programs that require muscle regulatory factor (MRF)-family genes. Myogenesis in the tail of the simple chordate Ciona exhibits a similar reliance on its single MRF-family gene, and diverse mechanisms activate Ci-Mrf Here, we show that myogenesis in the atrial siphon muscles (ASMs) and oral siphon muscles (OSMs), which control the exhalant and inhalant siphons, respectively, also requires Mrf We characterize the ontogeny of OSM progenitors and compare the molecular basis of Mrf activation in OSM versus ASM. In both muscle types, Ebf and Tbx1/10 are expressed and function upstream of Mrf However, we demonstrate that regulatory relationships between Tbx1/10, Ebf and Mrf differ between the OSM and ASM lineages. We propose that Tbx1, Ebf and Mrf homologs form an ancient conserved regulatory state for pharyngeal muscle specification, whereas their regulatory relationships might be more evolutionarily variable.

27625393	RNA-protein complexes play a central role in the regulation of fundamental cellular processes, such as mRNA splicing, localization, translation and degradation. The misregulation of these interactions can cause a variety of human diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Recently, many strategies have been developed to comprehensively analyze these complex and highly dynamic RNA-protein networks. Extensive efforts have been made to purify in vivo-assembled RNA-protein complexes. In this review, we focused on commonly used RNA-centric approaches that involve mass spectrometry, which are powerful tools for identifying proteins bound to a given RNA. We present various RNA capture strategies that primarily depend on whether the RNA of interest is modified. Moreover, we briefly discuss the advantages and limitations of in vitro and in vivo approaches. Furthermore, we describe recent advances in quantitative proteomics as well as the methods that are most commonly used to validate robust mass spectrometry data. Finally, we present approaches that have successfully identified expanded repeat-binding proteins, which present abnormal RNA-protein interactions that result in the development of many neurological diseases.

27458201	The CRISPR/Cas9 system is a powerful genome editing tool and has been widely used for biomedical research. However, many challenges, such as off-target effects and lack of easy solutions for multiplex targeting, are still limiting its applications. To overcome these challenges, we first developed a highly efficient doxycycline-inducible Cas9-EGFP vector. This vector allowed us to track the cells for uniform temporal control and efficient gene disruption, even in a polyclonal setting. Furthermore, the inducible CRISPR/Cas9 system dramatically decreased off-target effects with a pulse exposure of the genome to the Cas9/sgRNA complex. To target multiple genes simultaneously, we established simple one-step cloning approaches for expression of multiple sgRNAs with improved vectors. By combining our inducible and multiplex genome editing approaches, we were able to simultaneously delete Lysine Demethylase (KDM) 5A, 5B and 5C efficiently in vitro and in vivo This user friendly and highly efficient toolbox provides a solution for easy genome editing with tight temporal control, minimal off-target effects and multiplex targeting.

27798611	Engineering and study of protein function by directed evolution has been limited by the technical requirement to use global mutagenesis or introduce DNA libraries. Here, we develop CRISPR-X, a strategy to repurpose the somatic hypermutation machinery for protein engineering in situ. Using catalytically inactive dCas9 to recruit variants of cytidine deaminase (AID) with MS2-modified sgRNAs, we can specifically mutagenize endogenous targets with limited off-target damage. This generates diverse libraries of localized point mutations and can target multiple genomic locations simultaneously. We mutagenize GFP and select for spectrum-shifted variants, including EGFP. Additionally, we mutate the target of the cancer therapeutic bortezomib, PSMB5, and identify known and novel mutations that confer bortezomib resistance. Finally, using a hyperactive AID variant, we mutagenize loci both upstream and downstream of transcriptional start sites. These experiments illustrate a powerful approach to create complex libraries of genetic variants in native context, which is broadly applicable to investigate and improve protein function.

27798563	CRISPR-Cas9 screens have been widely adopted to analyze coding-gene functions, but high-throughput screening of non-coding elements using this method is more challenging because indels caused by a single cut in non-coding regions are unlikely to produce a functional knockout. A high-throughput method to produce deletions of non-coding DNA is needed. We report a high-throughput genomic deletion strategy to screen for functional long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that is based on a lentiviral paired-guide RNA (pgRNA) library. Applying our screening method, we identified 51 lncRNAs that can positively or negatively regulate human cancer cell growth. We validated 9 of 51 lncRNA hits using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genomic deletion, functional rescue, CRISPR activation or inhibition and gene-expression profiling. Our high-throughput pgRNA genome deletion method will enable rapid identification of functional mammalian non-coding elements.

27776111	The ability to dynamically manipulate the transcriptome is important for studying how gene networks direct cellular functions and how network perturbations cause disease. Nuclease-dead CRISPR-dCas9 transcriptional regulators, while offering an approach for controlling individual gene expression, remain incapable of dynamically coordinating complex transcriptional events. Here, we describe a flexible dCas9-based platform for chemical-inducible complex gene regulation. From a screen of chemical- and light-inducible dimerization systems, we identified two potent chemical inducers that mediate efficient gene activation and repression in mammalian cells. We combined these inducers with orthogonal dCas9 regulators to independently control expression of different genes within the same cell. Using this platform, we further devised AND, OR, NAND, and NOR dCas9 logic operators and a diametric regulator that activates gene expression with one inducer and represses with another. This work provides a robust CRISPR-dCas9-based platform for enacting complex transcription programs that is suitable for large-scale transcriptome engineering.

27723754	A large number of genetic variants have been associated with human diseases. However, the lack of a genetic diversification approach has impeded our ability to interrogate functions of genetic variants in mammalian cells. Current screening methods can only be used to disrupt a gene or alter its expression. Here we report the fusion of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) with nuclease-inactive clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated protein 9 (dCas9) for efficient genetic diversification, which enabled high-throughput screening of functional variants. Guided by single guide (sg)RNAs, dCas9-AID-P182X (AIDx) directly changed cytidines or guanines to the other three bases independent of AID hotspot motifs, generating a large repertoire of variants at desired loci. Coupled with a uracil-DNA glycosylase inhibitor, dCas9-AIDx converted targeted cytidines specifically to thymines, creating specific point mutations. By targeting BCR-ABL with dCas9-AIDx, we efficiently identified known and new mutations conferring imatinib resistance in chronic myeloid leukemia cells. Thus, targeted AID-mediated mutagenesis (TAM) provides a forward genetic tool to screen for gain-of-function variants at base resolution.	Y Ma|J Zhang|W Yin|Z Zhang|Y Song|X Chang
27793988	Methods for genetic manipulation of Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent of Chagas disease, have been highly inefficient, and no endogenous tagging of genes has been reported to date. We report here the use of the CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas9 (CRISPR-associated gene 9) system for endogenously tagging genes in this parasite. The utility of the method was established by tagging genes encoding proteins of known localization such as TcFCaBP (flagellar calcium binding protein) and TcVP1 (vacuolar proton pyrophosphatase), and two proteins of undefined or disputed localization, the TcMCU (mitochondrial calcium uniporter) and TcIP3R (inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor). We confirmed the flagellar and acidocalcisome localization of TcFCaBP and TcVP1 by co-localization with antibodies to the flagellum and acidocalcisomes, respectively. As expected, TcMCU was co-localized with the voltage-dependent anion channel to the mitochondria. However, in contrast to previous reports and our own results using overexpressed TcIP3R, endogenously tagged TcIP3R showed co-localization with antibodies against VP1 to acidocalcisomes. These results are also in agreement with our previous reports on the localization of this channel to acidocalcisomes of Trypanosoma brucei and suggest that caution should be exercised when overexpression of tagged genes is done to localize proteins in T. cruzi.

27789686	Over the past years, CRISPR/Cas9 mediated genome editing has developed into a powerful tool for modifying genomes in various organisms. In high-throughput screens, CRISPR/Cas9 mediated gene perturbations can be used for the systematic functional analysis of whole genomes. Discoveries from such screens provide a wealth of knowledge about gene to phenotype relationships in various biological model systems. However, a database resource to query results efficiently has been lacking. To this end, we developed GenomeCRISPR (http://genomecrispr.org), a database for genome-scale CRISPR/Cas9 screens. Currently, GenomeCRISPR contains data on more than 550 000 single guide RNAs (sgRNA) derived from 84 different experiments performed in 48 different human cell lines, comprising all screens in human cells using CRISPR/Cas published to date. GenomeCRISPR provides data mining options and tools, such as gene or genomic region search. Phenotypic and genome track views allow users to investigate and compare the results of different screens, or the impact of different sgRNAs on the gene of interest. An Application Programming Interface (API) allows for automated data access and batch download. As more screening data will become available, we also aim at extending the database to include functional genomic data from other organisms and enable cross-species comparisons.

27789334	In order to investigate the diverse characteristics of clustered, regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) arrays and the distribution of virulence factor genes in avian Escherichia coli, 80 E. coli isolates obtained from chickens with avian pathogenic E. coli (APEC) or avian fecal commensal E. coli (AFEC) were identified. Using the multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR), five genes were subjected to phylogenetic typing and examined for CRISPR arrays to study genetic relatedness among the strains. The strains were further analyzed for CRISPR loci and virulence factor genes to determine a possible association between their CRISPR elements and their potential virulence. The strains were divided into five phylogenetic groups: A, B1, B2, D and E. It was confirmed that two types of CRISPR arrays, CRISPR1 and CRISPR2, which contain up to 246 distinct spacers, were amplified in most of the strains. Further classification of the isolates was achieved by sorting them into nine CRISPR clusters based on their spacer profiles, which indicates a candidate typing method for E. coli. Several significant differences in invasion-associated gene distribution were found between the APEC isolates and the AFEC isolates. Our results identified the distribution of 11 virulence genes and CRISPR diversity in 80 strains. It was demonstrated that, with the exception of iucD and aslA, there was no sharp demarcation in the gene distribution between the pathogenic (APEC) and commensal (AFEC) strains, while the total number of indicated CRISPR spacers may have a positive correlation with the potential pathogenicity of the E. coli isolates.

27647432	Production of proteins and biochemicals in microbial cell factories is often limited by carbon and energy spent on excess biomass formation. To address this issue, we developed several genetic growth switches based on CRISPR interference technology. We demonstrate that growth of Escherichia coli can be controlled by repressing the DNA replication machinery, by targeting dnaA and oriC, or by blocking nucleotide synthesis through pyrF or thyA. This way, total GFP-protein production could be increased by up to 2.2-fold. Single-cell dynamic tracking in microfluidic systems was used to confirm functionality of the growth switches. Decoupling of growth from production of biochemicals was demonstrated for mevalonate, a precursor for isoprenoid compounds. Mass yield of mevalonate was increased by 41%, and production was maintained for more than 45h after activation of the pyrF-based growth switch. The developed methods represent a promising approach for increasing production yield and titer for proteins and biochemicals.	S Li|CB Jendresen|A Grünberger|C Ronda|SI Jensen|S Noack|AT Nielsen
27481676	Trans-acting regulators provide novel opportunities to study essential genes and regulate metabolic pathways. We have adapted the clustered regularly interspersed palindromic repeats (CRISPR) system from Streptococcus pyogenes to repress genes in trans in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7002 (hereafter PCC 7002). With this approach, termed CRISPR interference (CRISPRi), transcription of a specific target sequence is repressed by a catalytically inactive Cas9 protein recruited to the target DNA by base-pair interactions with a single guide RNA that is complementary to the target sequence. We adapted this system for PCC 7002 and achieved conditional and titratable repression of a heterologous reporter gene, yellow fluorescent protein. Next, we demonstrated the utility of finely tuning native gene expression by downregulating the abundance of phycobillisomes. In addition, we created a conditional auxotroph by repressing synthesis of the carboxysome, an essential component of the carbon concentrating mechanism cyanobacteria use to fix atmospheric CO2. Lastly, we demonstrated a novel strategy for increasing central carbon flux by conditionally downregulating a key node in nitrogen assimilation. The resulting cells produced 2-fold more lactate than a baseline engineered cell line, representing the highest photosynthetically generated productivity to date. This work is the first example of titratable repression in cyanobacteria using CRISPRi, enabling dynamic regulation of essential processes and manipulation of flux through central carbon metabolism. This tool facilitates the study of essential genes of unknown function and enables groundbreaking metabolic engineering capability, by providing a straightforward approach to redirect metabolism and carbon flux in the production of high-value chemicals.

27402906	Despite the growing popularity in using CRISPR/Cas9 technology for genome editing and gene knockout, its performance still relies on well-designed single guide RNAs (sgRNA). In this study, we propose a web application for the Design and Optimization (CRISPR-DO) of guide sequences that target both coding and non-coding regions in spCas9 CRISPR system across human, mouse, zebrafish, fly and worm genomes. CRISPR-DO uses a computational sequence model to predict sgRNA efficiency, and employs a specificity scoring function to evaluate the potential of off-target effect. It also provides information on functional conservation of target sequences, as well as the overlaps with exons, putative regulatory sequences and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The web application has a user-friendly genome-browser interface to facilitate the selection of the best target DNA sequences for experimental design.

27786189	The CRISPR/Cas9 system is a recently developed genome editing technique. In this study, we used a modified CRISPR system, which employs the fusion of inactive Cas9 (dCas9) and the FokI endonuclease (FokI-dCas9) to correct the most common variant (allele frequency 21.4%) in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene - c.1222C>T (p.Arg408Trp) - as an approach toward curing phenylketonuria (PKU). PKU is the most common inherited diseases in amino acid metabolism. It leads to severe neurological and neuropsychological symptoms if untreated or late diagnosed. Correction of the disease-causing variants could rescue residual PAH activity and restore normal function. Co-expression of a single guide RNA plasmid, a FokI-dCas9-zsGreen1 plasmid, and the presence of a single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide in PAH_c.1222C>T COS-7 cells - an in vitro model for PKU - corrected the PAH variant and restored PAH activity. Also in this system, the HDR enhancer RS-1 improved correction efficiency. This proof-of-concept indicates the potential of the FokI-dCas9 system for precision medicine, in particular for targeting PKU and other monogenic metabolic diseases.

27240718	CRISPR-Cas9 has been explored as a powerful tool for genome engineering for many organisms. Meanwhile, dCas9 which lacks endonuclease activity but can still bind to target loci has been engineered for efficient gene transcription repression. Clostridium beijerinckii, an industrially significant species capable of biosolvent production, is generally difficult to metabolically engineer. Recently, we reported our work in developing customized CRISPR-Cas9 system for genome engineering in C. beijerinckii. However, in many cases, gene expression repression (rather than actual DNA mutation) is more desirable for various biotechnological applications. Here, we further demonstrated gene transcription repression in C. beijerinckii using CRISPR-dCas9. A small RNA promoter was employed to drive the expression of the single chimeric guide RNA targeting on the promoter region of amylase gene, while a constitutive thiolase promoter was used to drive Streptococcus pyogenes dCas9 expression. The growth assay on starch agar plates showed qualitatively significant repression of amylase activity in C. beijerinckii transformant with CRISPR-dCas9 compared to the control strain. Further amylase activity quantification demonstrated consistent repression (65-97% through the fermentation process) on the activity in the transformant with CRISPR-dCas9 versus in the control. Our results provided essential references for engineering CRISPR-dCas9 as an effective tool for tunable gene transcription repression in diverse microorganisms. Biotechnol.

27783893	In order to efficiently edit eukaryotic genomes, it is critical to test the impact of chromatin dynamics on CRISPR/Cas9 function and develop strategies to adapt the system to eukaryotic contexts. So far, research has extensively characterized the relationship between the CRISPR endonuclease Cas9 and the composition of the RNA-DNA duplex that mediates the system's precision. Evidence suggests that chromatin modifications and DNA packaging can block eukaryotic genome editing by custom-built DNA endonucleases like Cas9; however, the underlying mechanism of Cas9 inhibition is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that closed, gene-silencing-associated chromatin is a mechanism for the interference of Cas9-mediated DNA editing. Our assays use a transgenic cell line with a drug-inducible switch to control chromatin states (open and closed) at a single genomic locus. We show that closed chromatin inhibits binding and editing at specific target sites and that artificial reversal of the silenced state restores editing efficiency. These results provide new insights to improve Cas9-mediated editing in human and other mammalian cells.	RM Daer|JP Cutts|DA Brafman|KA Haynes
27775045	Here we describe "Supernova" series of vector systems that enable single-cell labeling and labeled cell-specific gene manipulation, when introduced by in utero electroporation (IUE) or adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene delivery. In Supernova, sparse labeling relies on low TRE leakage. In a small population of cells with over-threshold leakage, initial tTA-independent weak expression is enhanced by tTA/TRE-positive feedback along with a site-specific recombination system (e.g., Cre/loxP, Flpe/FRT). Sparse and bright labeling by Supernova with little background enables the visualization of the morphological details of individual neurons in densely packed brain areas such as the cortex and hippocampus, both during development and in adulthood. Sparseness levels are adjustable. Labeled cell-specific gene knockout was accomplished by introducing Cre/loxP-based Supernova vectors into floxed mice. Furthermore, by combining with RNAi, TALEN, and CRISPR/Cas9 technologies, IUE-based Supernova achieved labeled cell-specific gene knockdown and editing/knockout without requiring genetically altered mice. Thus, Supernova system is highly extensible and widely applicable for single-cell analyses in complex organs, such as the mammalian brain.

27773878	The study of enterococcal genomes has grown considerably in recent years. While special attention is paid to comparative genomic analysis among clinical relevant isolates, in this study we performed an exhaustive comparative analysis of enterococcal genomes of food origin and/or with potential to be used as probiotics. Beyond common genetic features, we especially aimed to identify those that are specific to enterococcal strains isolated from a certain food-related source as well as features present in a species-specific manner. Thus, the genome sequences of 25 Enterococcus strains, from 7 different species, were examined and compared. Their phylogenetic relationship was reconstructed based on orthologous proteins and whole genomes. Likewise, markers associated with a successful colonization (bacteriocin genes and genomic islands) and genome plasticity (phages and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) were investigated for lifestyle specific genetic features. At the same time, a search for antibiotic resistance genes was carried out, since they are of big concern in the food industry. Finally, it was possible to locate 1617 FIGfam families as a core proteome universally present among the genera and to determine that most of the accessory genes code for hypothetical proteins, providing reasonable hints to support their functional characterization.

27773522	For a long time the mechanism of immunity provided by the Type III CRISPR-Cas systems appeared to be inconsistent: the Type III-A Csm complex of Staphylococcus epidermidis was first reported to target DNA while Type III-B Cmr complexes were shown to target RNA. This long-standing conundrum has now been resolved by finding that the Type III CRISPR-Cas systems are both RNases and target RNA-activated DNA nucleases. The immunity is achieved by coupling binding and cleavage of RNA transcripts to the degradation of invading DNA. The base-pairing potential between the target RNA and the CRISPR RNA (crRNA) 5'-handle seems to play an important role in discriminating self and non-self nucleic acids; however, the detailed mechanism remains to be uncovered.

27717172	Intestinimonas is a newly described bacterial genus with representative strains present in the intestinal tract of human and other animals. Despite unique metabolic features including the production of butyrate from both sugars and amino acids, there is to date no data on their diversity, ecology, and physiology. Using a comprehensive phylogenetic approach, Intestinimomas was found to include at least three species that colonize primarily the human and mouse intestine. We focused on the most common and cultivable species of the genus, Intestinimonas butyriciproducens, and performed detailed genomic and physiological comparison of strains SRB521T and AF211, isolated from the mouse and human gut respectively. The complete 3.3-Mb genomic sequences of both strains were highly similar with 98.8% average nucleotide identity, testifying to their assignment to one single species. However, thorough analysis revealed significant genomic rearrangements, variations in phage-derived sequences, and the presence of new CRISPR sequences in both strains. Moreover, strain AF211 appeared to be more efficient than strain SRB521T in the conversion of the sugars arabinose and galactose. In conclusion, this study provides genomic and physiological insight into Intestinimonas butyriciproducens, a prevalent butyrate-producing species, differentiating strains that originate from the mouse and human gut.

27571970	To provide a simple method to make a stable ΔF508-CFTR-expressing T84 cell line that can be used as an efficient screening model system for ΔF508-CFTR rescue.	CFTR knockout cell lines were generated by Cas9 with a single-guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting exon 1 of the CFTR genome, which produced indels that abolished CFTR protein expressions. Next, stable ΔF508-CFTR expression was achieved by genome integration of ΔF508-CFTR via the lentivirus infection system. Finally, we showed functional rescue of ΔF508-CFTR not only by growing the cells at a low temperature, but also incubating with VX-809, a ΔF508-CFTR corrector, in the established T84 cells expressing ΔF508-CFTR.	This cell system provides an appropriate screening platform for rescue of ΔF508-CFTR, especially related to protein folding, escaped from endoplasmic-reticulum-associated protein degradation, and membrane transport.

27744049	Locusts are important agricultural pests worldwide and regarded as study models for entomology. However, the absence of targeted gene manipulation systems for locusts has restricted their applications for research. Herein, we report the successful use of the CRISPR/Cas9 system to induce a targeted heritable mutagenesis of the migratory locust, Locusta migratoria. The target sequence of gRNA was designed to disrupt the gene encoding the odorant receptor co-receptor (Orco) and examine the roles of the odorant receptor pathway in the locust. Microinjection of the mixture of Cas9-mRNA and Orco-gRNA into the locust eggs resulted in efficient target-gene editing at a rate of 71.7% in G0 animals and achieved a germline efficiency of up to 88.1% in G1 animals. By a crossing strategy, we successfully established stable Orco mutant lines. EAGs and SSRs indicated that the fourth-instar nymphs of the Orco mutants showed severely impaired electrophysiological responses to multiple odors. The Orco mutant locusts lost an attraction response to aggregation pheromones under the crowding conditions. The locomotor activity and body coloration of the Orco mutant locusts did not significantly differ from those of the two other genotypes. This study provides an easy and effective approach by using the CRISPR/Cas9 system for generating loss-of-function mutants for functional genetic studies of locusts and for managing insect pests.

27573013	CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat)-Cas (CRISPR-associated protein) systems are diverse and found in many archaea and bacteria. These systems have mainly been characterized as adaptive immune systems able to protect against invading mobile genetic elements, including viruses. The first step in this protection is acquisition of spacer sequences from the invader DNA and incorporation of those sequences into the CRISPR array, termed CRISPR adaptation. Progress in understanding the mechanisms and requirements of CRISPR adaptation has largely been accomplished using overexpression of cas genes or plasmid loss assays; little work has focused on endogenous CRISPR-acquired immunity from viral predation. Here, we developed a new biofilm-based assay system to enrich for Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains with new spacer acquisition. We used this assay to demonstrate that P. aeruginosa rapidly acquires spacers protective against DMS3vir, an engineered lytic variant of the Mu-like bacteriophage DMS3, through primed CRISPR adaptation from spacers present in the native CRISPR2 array. We found that for the P. aeruginosa type I-F system, the cas1 gene is required for CRISPR adaptation, recG contributes to (but is not required for) primed CRISPR adaptation, recD is dispensable for primed CRISPR adaptation, and finally, the ability of a putative priming spacer to prime can vary considerably depending on the specific sequences of the spacer.	Our understanding of CRISPR adaptation has expanded largely through experiments in type I CRISPR systems using plasmid loss assays, mutants of Escherichia coli, or cas1-cas2 overexpression systems, but there has been little focus on studying the adaptation of endogenous systems protecting against a lytic bacteriophage. Here we describe a biofilm system that allows P. aeruginosa to rapidly gain spacers protective against a lytic bacteriophage. This approach has allowed us to probe the requirements for CRISPR adaptation in the endogenous type I-F system of P. aeruginosa Our data suggest that CRISPR-acquired immunity in a biofilm may be one reason that many P. aeruginosa strains maintain a CRISPR-Cas system.

27768957	In vitro differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells provides a systematic platform to investigate the physiological development and function of the human nervous system, as well as the etiology and consequence when these processes go awry. Recent development in three-dimensional (3D) organotypic culture systems allows modeling of the complex structure formation of the human CNS, and the intricate interactions between various resident neuronal and glial cell types. Combined with an ever-expanding genome editing and regulation toolkit such as CRISPR/Cas9, it is now a possibility to study human neurological disease in the relevant molecular, cellular and anatomical context. In this article, we review recent progress in 3D neural culture and the implications for disease modeling.	J Muffat|Y Li|R Jaenisch
27768763	Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a common cause of intellectual disability that is most often due to a CGG-repeat expansion mutation in the FMR1 gene that triggers epigenetic gene silencing. Epigenetic modifying drugs can only transiently and modestly induce FMR1 reactivation in the presence of the elongated CGG repeat. As a proof-of-principle, we excised the expanded CGG-repeat in both somatic cell hybrids containing the human fragile X chromosome and human FXS iPS cells using the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. We observed transcriptional reactivation in approximately 67% of the CRISPR cut hybrid colonies and in 20% of isolated human FXS iPSC colonies. The reactivated cells produced FMRP and exhibited a decline in DNA methylation at the FMR1 locus. These data demonstrate the excision of the expanded CGG-repeat from the fragile X chromosome can result in FMR1 reactivation.	N Xie|H Gong|JA Suhl|P Chopra|T Wang|ST Warren
27768202	To employ type II clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 endonuclease to suppress ocular angiogenesis by genomic disruption of VEGF-A in human RPE cells.	CRISPR sequences targeting exon 1 of human VEGF-A were computationally identified based on predicted Cas9 on- and off-target probabilities. Single guide RNA (gRNA) cassettes with these target sequences were cloned into lentiviral vectors encoding the Streptococcuspyogenes Cas9 endonuclease (SpCas9) gene. The lentiviral vectors were used to infect ARPE-19 cells, a human RPE cell line. Frequency of insertion or deletion (indel) mutations was assessed by T7 endonuclease 1 mismatch detection assay; mRNA levels were assessed with quantitative real-time PCR; and VEGF-A protein levels were determined by ELISA. In vitro angiogenesis was measured using an endothelial cell tube formation assay.	Five gRNAs targeting VEGF-A were selected based on the highest predicted on-target probabilities, lowest off-target probabilities, or combined average of both scores. Lentiviral delivery of the top-scoring gRNAs with SpCas9 resulted in indel formation in the VEGF-A gene at frequencies up to 37.0% ± 4.0% with corresponding decreases in secreted VEGF-A protein up to 41.2% ± 7.4% (P < 0.001), and reduction of endothelial tube formation up to 39.4% ± 9.8% (P = 0.02). No significant indel formation in the top three putative off-target sites tested was detected.	The CRISPR-Cas9 endonuclease system may reduce VEGF-A secretion from human RPE cells and suppress angiogenesis, supporting the possibility of employing gene editing for antiangiogenesis therapy in ocular diseases.

27765793	Calmodulinopathies comprise a new category of potentially life-threatening genetic arrhythmia syndromes capable of producing severe long-QT syndrome (LQTS) with mutations involving CALM1, CALM2, or CALM3. The underlying basis of this form of LQTS is a disruption of Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent inactivation of L-type Ca2+ channels.	To gain insight into the mechanistic underpinnings of calmodulinopathies and devise new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of this form of LQTS.	We generated and characterized the functional properties of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes from a patient with D130G-CALM2-mediated LQTS, thus creating a platform with which to devise and test novel therapeutic strategies. The patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes display (1) significantly prolonged action potentials, (2) disrupted Ca2+ cycling properties, and (3) diminished Ca2+/CaM-dependent inactivation of L-type Ca2+ channels. Next, taking advantage of the fact that calmodulinopathy patients harbor a mutation in only 1 of 6 redundant CaM-encoding alleles, we devised a strategy using CRISPR interference to selectively suppress the mutant gene while sparing the wild-type counterparts. Indeed, suppression of CALM2 expression produced a functional rescue in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes with D130G-CALM2, as shown by the normalization of action potential duration and Ca2+/CaM-dependent inactivation after treatment. Moreover, CRISPR interference can be designed to achieve selective knockdown of any of the 3 CALM genes, making it a generalizable therapeutic strategy for any calmodulinopathy.	Overall, this therapeutic strategy holds great promise for calmodulinopathy patients as it represents a generalizable intervention capable of specifically altering CaM expression and potentially attenuating LQTS-triggered cardiac events, thus initiating a path toward precision medicine.

27760321	Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive cancer with a poor prognosis, for which mainstream treatments have not changed for decades. To identify additional therapeutic targets in AML, we optimize a genome-wide clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) screening platform and use it to identify genetic vulnerabilities in AML cells. We identify 492 AML-specific cell-essential genes, including several established therapeutic targets such as DOT1L, BCL2, and MEN1, and many other genes including clinically actionable candidates. We validate selected genes using genetic and pharmacological inhibition, and chose KAT2A as a candidate for downstream study. KAT2A inhibition demonstrated anti-AML activity by inducing myeloid differentiation and apoptosis, and suppressed the growth of primary human AMLs of diverse genotypes while sparing normal hemopoietic stem-progenitor cells. Our results propose that KAT2A inhibition should be investigated as a therapeutic strategy in AML and provide a large number of genetic vulnerabilities of this leukemia that can be pursued in downstream studies.

27566508	Throughout the decades of its history, the advances in bacteria-based bio-industries have coincided with great leaps in strain engineering technologies. Recently unveiled clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated proteins (Cas) systems are now revolutionizing biotechnology as well as biology. Diverse technologies have been derived from CRISPR/Cas systems in bacteria, yet the applications unfortunately have not been actively employed in bacteria as extensively as in eukaryotic organisms. A recent trend of engineering less explored strains in industrial microbiology-metabolic engineering, synthetic biology, and other related disciplines-is demanding facile yet robust tools, and various CRISPR technologies have potential to cater to the demands. Here, we briefly review the science in CRISPR/Cas systems and the milestone inventions that enabled numerous CRISPR technologies. Next, we describe CRISPR/Cas-derived technologies for bacterial strain development, including genome editing and gene expression regulation applications. Then, other CRISPR technologies possessing great potential for industrial applications are described, including typing and tracking of bacterial strains, virome identification, vaccination of bacteria, and advanced antimicrobial approaches. For each application, we note our suggestions for additional improvements as well. In the same context, replication of CRISPR/Cas-based chromosome imaging technologies developed originally in eukaryotic systems is introduced with its potential impact on studying bacterial chromosomal dynamics. Also, the current patent status of CRISPR technologies is reviewed. Finally, we provide some insights to the future of CRISPR technologies for bacterial systems by proposing complementary techniques to be developed for the use of CRISPR technologies in even wider range of applications.

27472027	The release of the first complete microbial genome sequences at the end of the past century opened the way for functional genomics and systems-biology to uncover the genetic basis of various phenotypes. The surge of available sequence data facilitated the development of novel genome editing techniques for system-level analytical studies. Recombineering allowed unprecedented throughput and efficiency in microbial genome editing and the recent discovery and widespread use of RNA-guided endonucleases offered several further perspectives: (i) previously recalcitrant species became editable, (ii) the efficiency of recombineering could be elevated, and as a result (iii) diverse genomic libraries could be generated more effectively. Supporting recombineering by RNA-guided endonucleases has led to success stories in metabolic engineering, but their use for system-level analysis is mostly unexplored. For the full exploitation of opportunities that are offered by the genome editing proficiency, future development of large scale analytical procedures is also vitally needed.

27742404	More and more genomes are sequenced and a great range of biological questions can be examined at the genomic level in a growing number of organisms. Testing the function of genome features, from gene networks, genome organization, conserved non-coding sequences to microRNAs, and, more generally, experimentally addressing the genotype-phenotype relationship is now possible owing to the clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 revolution of genome editing. In the present review, we give a brief overview of the CRISPR/Cas9 toolbox and different strategies for genome editing currently available. We list the first examples of applications to marine organisms and also draw from studies in more common laboratory models to suggest both guidelines for design of genome editing experiments as well as discuss challenges specific to marine organisms. In addition, we discuss future perspectives, including applications of CRISPR/Cas9 to base editing and targeted reprogramming of gene transcription.	T Momose|JP Concordet
27741224	Molecular scissors engineered for site-specific modification of the genome hold great promise for effective functional analyses of genes, genomes and epigenomes and could improve our understanding of the molecular underpinnings of disease states and facilitate novel therapeutic applications. Several platforms for molecular scissors that enable targeted genome engineering have been developed, including zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and, most recently, clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated-9 (Cas9). The CRISPR/Cas9 system's simplicity, facile engineering and amenability to multiplexing make it the system of choice for many applications. CRISPR/Cas9 has been used to generate disease models to study genetic diseases. Improvements are urgently needed for various aspects of the CRISPR/Cas9 system, including the system's precision, delivery and control over the outcome of the repair process. Here, we discuss the current status of genome engineering and its implications for the future of biological research and gene therapy.	A Eid|MM Mahfouz
27739525	Retinoblastoma is a pediatric eye tumor in which bi-allelic inactivation of the Retinoblastoma 1 (RB1) gene is the initiating genetic lesion. Although recently curative rates of retinoblastoma have increased, there are at this time no molecular targeted therapies available. This is, in part, due to the lack of highly penetrant and rapid retinoblastoma animal models that facilitate rapid identification of targets that allow therapeutic intervention. Different mouse models are available, all based on genetic deactivation of both Rb1 and Retinoblastoma-like 1 (Rbl1), and each showing different kinetics of retinoblastoma development. Here, we show by CRISPR/Cas9 techniques that similar to the mouse, neither rb1 nor rbl1 single mosaic mutant Xenopus tropicalis develop tumors, whereas rb1/rbl1 double mosaic mutant tadpoles rapidly develop retinoblastoma. Moreover, occasionally presence of pinealoblastoma (trilateral retinoblastoma) was detected. We thus present the first CRISPR/Cas9 mediated cancer model in Xenopus tropicalis and the first genuine genetic non-mammalian retinoblastoma model. The rapid kinetics of our model paves the way for use as a pre-clinical model. Additionally, this retinoblastoma model provides unique possibilities for fast elucidation of novel drug targets by triple multiplex CRISPR/Cas9 gRNA injections (rb1 + rbl1 + modifier gene) in order to address the clinically unmet need of targeted retinoblastoma therapy.

27738137	The Escherichia coli type I-E CRISPR-Cas system Cascade effector is a multisubunit complex that binds CRISPR RNA (crRNA). Through its 32-nucleotide spacer sequence, Cascade-bound crRNA recognizes protospacers in foreign DNA, causing its destruction during CRISPR interference or acquisition of additional spacers in CRISPR array during primed CRISPR adaptation. Within Cascade, the crRNA spacer interacts with a hexamer of Cas7 subunits. We show that crRNAs with a spacer length reduced to 14 nucleotides cause primed adaptation, while crRNAs with spacer lengths of more than 20 nucleotides cause both primed adaptation and target interference in vivo Shortened crRNAs assemble into altered-stoichiometry Cascade effector complexes containing less than the normal amount of Cas7 subunits. The results show that Cascade assembly is driven by crRNA and suggest that multisubunit type I CRISPR effectors may have evolved from much simpler ancestral complexes.

27733506	The Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats system allows a single guide RNA (sgRNA) to direct a protein with combined helicase and nuclease activity to the DNA. Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9), a CRISPR-associated protein, has revolutionized our ability to probe and edit the human genome in vitro and in vivo Arguably, the true modularity of the Cas9 platform is conferred through the ease of sgRNA programmability as well as the degree of modifications the sgRNA can tolerate without compromising its association with SpCas9 and function. In this review, we focus on the properties and recent engineering advances of the sgRNA component in Cas9-mediated genome targeting.	CM Nowak|S Lawson|M Zerez|L Bleris
27725766	The CRISPR/Cas9 complex, which is composed of a guide RNA (gRNA) and the Cas9 nuclease, is useful for carrying out genome modifications in various organisms. Recently, the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated locus-specific integration of a reporter, which contains the Mbait sequence targeted using Mbait-gRNA, the hsp70 promoter and the eGFP gene, has allowed the visualization of the target gene expression. However, it has not been ascertained whether the reporter integrations at both targeted alleles cause loss-of-function phenotypes in zebrafish. In this study, we have inserted the Mbait-hs-eGFP reporter into the pax2a gene because the disruption of pax2a causes the loss of the midbrain-hindbrain boundary (MHB) in zebrafish. In the heterozygous Tg[pax2a-hs:eGFP] embryos, MHB formed normally and the eGFP expression recapitulated the endogenous pax2a expression, including the MHB. We observed the loss of the MHB in homozygous Tg[pax2a-hs:eGFP] embryos. Furthermore, we succeeded in integrating the Mbait-hs-eGFP reporter into an uncharacterized gene epdr1. The eGFP expression in heterozygous Tg[epdr1-hs:eGFP] embryos overlapped the epdr1 expression, whereas the distribution of eGFP-positive cells was disorganized in the MHB of homozygous Tg[epdr1-hs:eGFP] embryos. We propose that the locus-specific integration of the Mbait-hs-eGFP reporter is a powerful method to investigate both gene expression profiles and loss-of-function phenotypes.

27722870	Bacteriophage play many varied roles in microbial ecology and evolution. This chapter collates a vast body of knowledge and expertise on Yersinia pestis phages, including the history of their isolation and classical methods for their isolation and identification. The genomic diversity of Y. pestis phage and bacteriophage islands in the Y. pestis genome are also discussed because all phage research represents a branch of genetics. In addition, our knowledge of the receptors that are recognized by Y. pestis phage, advances in phage therapy for Y. pestis infections, the application of phage in the detection of Y. pestis, and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) sequences of Y. pestis from prophage DNA are all reviewed here.

27709574	Gene targeting and editing is an essential tool for both basic research and clinical application such as gene therapy. Several endonucleases have been invented to fulfill these purposes, including zinc finger nucleases, TALEN, and CRISPR/Cas9. Although all of these systems can target DNA sequence with high efficiency, they also exert off-target effects and genotoxicity. The off-target effects might not hinder their usage in animal models because the correctly targeted cells can be selected for further studies. However, the off-target effects could cause mutations which may be damaging or cancerous to the patients. In this chapter, we describe a genome-editing nuclease method which relies on modifying specific amino acids on a monomeric endonuclease, I-SceI, to recognize a targeted sequence in the human genome. This nuclease is small in size and shows a much lower genotoxicity compared to other nucleases including CRISPR/Cas9.	Z He|K Kee
27709570	Efficient and site-specific alteration of the genome is key to decoding and altering the genomic information of an organism. Over the last couple of years, the RNA-guided Cas9 nucleases derived from the prokaryotic type 2 CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) systems have drastically improved our ability to engineer the genomes of a variety of organisms including Toxoplasma gondii. In this chapter, we describe detailed protocols for using the CRISPR/Cas9 system adapted from Streptococcus pyogenes to perform efficient genetic manipulations in T. gondii such as gene disruption, gene tagging and genetic complementation. The technical details of the strategy, including CRISPR plasmid construction, target construct generation, parasite transfection and positive clone identification are also provided. These methods are easy to customize to any gene of interest (GOI) and will greatly accelerate studies on this important pathogen.	B Shen|K Brown|S Long|LD Sibley
27709569	The recent advent of engineered nucleases including the CRISPR/Cas9 system has greatly facilitated genome manipulation in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). In addition to facilitating hPSC-based disease studies, the application of genome engineering in hPSCs has also opened up new avenues for cell replacement therapy. To improve consistency and reproducibility of hPSC-based studies, and to meet the safety and regulatory requirements for clinical translation, it is necessary to use a defined, xeno-free cell culture system. This chapter describes protocols for CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in an inducible Cas9 hPSC-based system, using cells cultured in chemically defined, xeno-free E8 Medium on a recombinant human vitronectin substrate. We detail procedures for the design and transfection of CRISPR guide RNAs, colony selection, and the expansion and validation of clonal mutant lines, all within this fully defined culture condition. These methods may be applied to a wide range of genome-engineering applications in hPSCs, including those that utilize different types of site-specific nucleases such as zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and TALENs, and form a closer step towards clinical utility of these cells.

27709568	CRISPR-Cas9 enables highly convenient multiplex genome engineering in cultured cells, because it utilizes generic Cas9 nuclease and an easily customizable single-guide RNA (sgRNA) for site-specific DNA double-strand break induction. We previously established a multiplex CRISPR-Cas9 assembly system for constructing an all-in-one vector simultaneously expressing multiple sgRNAs and Cas9 nuclease or other Cas9 variants including FokI-dCas9, which supersedes the wild-type Cas9 with regard to high specificity. In this chapter, we describe a streamlined protocol to design and construct multiplex CRISPR-Cas9 or FokI-dCas9 vectors, to introduce them into cultured cells by lipofection or electroporation, to enrich the genomically edited cells with a transient puromycin selection, to validate the mutation efficiency by Surveyor nuclease assay, and to perform off-target analyses. We show that our protocol enables highly efficient multiplex genome engineering even in hard-to-transfect HepG2 cells.	T Sakuma|T Sakamoto|T Yamamoto
27709567	Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein (Cas) system is a newly emerging mutagenesis (gene-editing) tool in genetic engineering. Among the agriculturally important crops, several genes have been successfully mutated by the system, and some agronomic important traits have been rapidly generated, which indicates the potential applications in both scientific research and plant breeding. In this chapter, we describe a standard gene-editing procedure to effectively target rice genes and to make specific rice mutants using the CRISPR/Cas9 system mediated by Agrobacterium transformation.

27709566	The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR associated protein 9 nuclease (Cas9) system is a powerful genome-editing tool for both chromosomal and extrachromosomal DNA. DNA viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which undergoes episomal replication in human cells, can be effectively edited by CRISPR/Cas9. We have demonstrated targeted editing of the EBV genome by CRISPR/Cas9 in several lines of EBV-infected cells. CRISPR/Cas9-based mutagenesis and genome engineering of EBV provides a new method for genetic analysis, which has some advantages over bacterial artificial chromosome-based recombineering. This approach might also prove useful in the cure of EBV infection. In this chapter, we use the knockout of the BART promoter as an example to detail the experimental procedures for construction of recombinant EBV in human cells.	KS Yuen|CP Chan|KH Kok|DY Jin

27708104	The noncoding genome affects gene regulation and disease, yet we lack tools for rapid identification and manipulation of noncoding elements. We developed a CRISPR screen using ~18,000 single guide RNAs targeting >700 kilobases surrounding the genes NF1, NF2, and CUL3, which are involved in BRAF inhibitor resistance in melanoma. We find that noncoding locations that modulate drug resistance also harbor predictive hallmarks of noncoding function. With a subset of regions at the CUL3 locus, we demonstrate that engineered mutations alter transcription factor occupancy and long-range and local epigenetic environments, implicating these sites in gene regulation and chemotherapeutic resistance. Through our expansion of the potential of pooled CRISPR screens, we provide tools for genomic discovery and for elucidating biologically relevant mechanisms of gene regulation.

27708057	Gene expression in mammals is regulated by noncoding elements that can affect physiology and disease, yet the functions and target genes of most noncoding elements remain unknown. We present a high-throughput approach that uses clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) interference (CRISPRi) to discover regulatory elements and identify their target genes. We assess >1 megabase of sequence in the vicinity of two essential transcription factors, MYC and GATA1, and identify nine distal enhancers that control gene expression and cellular proliferation. Quantitative features of chromatin state and chromosome conformation distinguish the seven enhancers that regulate MYC from other elements that do not, suggesting a strategy for predicting enhancer-promoter connectivity. This CRISPRi-based approach can be applied to dissect transcriptional networks and interpret the contributions of noncoding genetic variation to human disease.

27699445	CRISPR/Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated) adaptive immune systems constitute a bacterial defence against invading nucleic acids derived from bacteriophages or plasmids. This prokaryotic system was adapted in molecular biology and became one of the most powerful and versatile platforms for genome engineering. CRISPR/Cas9 is a simple and rapid tool which enables the efficient modification of endogenous genes in various species and cell types. Moreover, a modified version of the CRISPR/Cas9 system with transcriptional repressors or activators allows robust transcription repression or activation of target genes. The simplicity of CRISPR/Cas9 has resulted in the widespread use of this technology in many fields, including basic research, biotechnology and biomedicine.

27698470	Knockin (KI) mouse carrying a point mutation has been an invaluable tool for disease modeling and analysis. Genome editing technologies using the CRISPR/Cas system has emerged as an alternative way to create KI mice. However, if the mice carry nucleotide insertions and/or deletions (InDels) in other genes, which could have unintentionally occurred during the establishment of the KI mouse line and potentially have larger impact than a point mutation, it would confound phenotyping of the KI mice. In this study, we performed whole exome sequencing of multiple lines of F1 heterozygous Ntrk1 KI mice generated using the CRISPR/Cas system in comparison to that of a wild-type mouse used as a control. We found three InDels in four KI mice but not in a control mouse. In vitro digestion assay suggested that each InDel occurred as a de novo mutation, was carried-over from the parental mice, or was incorporated through the Cas9 nuclease mediated off-target cleavage. These results suggest that frequency of InDels found in KI mice generated by the CRISPR/Cas technology is not high, but cannot be neglected and careful assessment of these mutations is warranted.

27698086	Soil bacteria engage each other in competitive and cooperative ways to determine their microenvironments. In this study, we report the identification of a large number of genes required for Myxococcus xanthus to engage Bacillus subtilis in a predator-prey relationship. We generated and tested over 6,000 individual transposon insertion mutants of M. xanthus and found many new factors required to promote efficient predation, including the specialized metabolite myxoprincomide, an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter permease, and a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) locus encoding bacterial immunity. We also identified genes known to be involved in predation, including those required for the production of exopolysaccharides and type IV pilus (T4P)-dependent motility, as well as chemosensory and two-component systems. Furthermore, deletion of these genes confirmed their role during predation. Overall, M. xanthus predation appears to be a multifactorial process, with multiple determinants enhancing predation capacity.	Soil bacteria engage each other in complex environments and utilize multiple traits to ensure survival. Here, we report the identification of multiple traits that enable a common soil organism, Myxococcus xanthus, to prey upon and utilize nutrients from another common soil organism, Bacillus subtilis We mutagenized the predator and carried out a screen to identify genes that were required to either enhance or diminish capacity to consume prey. We identified dozens of genes encoding factors that contribute to the overall repertoire for the predator to successfully engage its prey in the natural environment.

27693319	Microbial morphology engineering has recently become interesting for biotechnology. Genes ftsZ and mreB encoding proteins of bacterial fission ring and skeletons, respectively, are essential for cell growth, they both are the most important genes keeping the bacterial shapes including the cell length and width, respectively. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats interference, abbreviated as CRISPRi, was for the first time used in this study to regulate expression intensities of ftsZ or/and mreB in E. coli. Five sgRNAs associated with CRISPRi were designed and synthesized, respectively, to target five various locations on genes ftsZ or mreB encoded in the E. coli chromosome, resulting in various reduced expression levels of ftsZ or/and mreB, respectively, forming elongated or/and fatter cells. Repressions on gene expressions of ftsZ or/and mreB could be further intensified by combining various sgRNAs together. It was found that the stronger the repression on genes ftsZ or/and mreB, the longer the E. coli fibers, and the larger the E. coli cells. Combined repressions on expressions of ftsZ and mreB generated long and larger E. coli with diverse morphologies including various sizes of gourds, bars, coccus, spindles, multi-angles and ellipsoids. In all cases, accumulations of intracellular biopolyester polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) were in direct proportional to the intracellular volumes, ranging from 40% to 80% PHB in bacterial cell dry weights, depending on the cell volumes increases by the above CRISPRi applications.

27684187	Genome-scale expression studies and comprehensive loss-of-function genetic screens have focused almost exclusively on the highest confidence candidate genes. Here, we describe a strategy for characterizing the lower confidence candidates identified by such approaches. We interrogated 177 genes that we classified as essential for the proliferation of cancer cells exhibiting constitutive β-catenin activity and integrated data for each of the candidates, derived from orthogonal short hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9-mediated gene editing knockout screens, to yield 69 validated genes. We then characterized the relationships between sets of these genes using complementary assays: medium-throughput stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-based mass spectrometry, yielding 3,639 protein-protein interactions, and a CRISPR-mediated pairwise double knockout screen, yielding 375 combinations exhibiting greater- or lesser-than-additive phenotypic effects indicating genetic interactions. These studies identify previously unreported regulators of β-catenin, define functional networks required for the survival of β-catenin-active cancers, and provide an experimental strategy that may be applied to define other signaling networks.

27681560	Fabry nephropathy is a major cause of morbidity and premature death in patients with Fabry disease (FD), a rare X-linked lysosomal storage disorder. Gb3, the main substrate of α-galactosidase A (α-Gal A), progressively accumulates within cells in a variety of tissues. Establishment of cell models has been useful as a tool for testing hypotheses of disease pathogenesis. We applied CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology to the GLA gene to develop human kidney cell models of FD in human immortalized podocytes, which are the main affected renal cell type. Our podocytes lack detectable α-Gal A activity and have increased levels of Gb3. To explore different pathways that could have distinct patterns of activation under conditions of α-gal A deficiency, we used a high-throughput antibody array to perform phosphorylation profiling of CRISPR/Cas9-edited and control podocytes. Changes in both total protein levels and in phosphorylation status per site were observed. Analysis of our candidate proteins suggests that multiple signaling pathways are impaired in FD.

27681417	Super-enhancers are tissue-specific cis-regulatory elements that drive expression of genes associated with cell identity and malignancy. A cardinal feature of super-enhancers is that they are transcribed to produce enhancer-derived RNAs (eRNAs). It remains unclear whether super-enhancers robustly activate genes in situ and whether their functions are attributable to eRNAs or the DNA element. CRISPR/Cas9 was used to systematically delete three discrete super-enhancers at the Nanog locus in embryonic stem cells, revealing functional differences in Nanog transcriptional regulation. One distal super-enhancer 45 kb upstream of Nanog (-45 enhancer) regulates both nearest neighbor genes, Nanog and Dppa3. Interestingly, eRNAs produced at the -45 enhancer specifically regulate Dppa3 expression by stabilizing looping of the -45 enhancer and Dppa3. Our work illustrates that genomic editing is required to determine enhancer function and points to a method to selectively target a subset of super-enhancer-regulated genes by depleting eRNAs.

27677251	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) represent a novel type of adaptive immune system found in eubacteria and archaebacteria. CRISPRs have recently generated a lot of attention due to their unique ability to catalog foreign nucleic acids, their ability to destroy foreign nucleic acids in a mechanism that shares some similarity to RNA interference, and the ability to utilize reconstituted CRISPR systems for genome editing in numerous organisms. In order to introduce CRISPR biology into an undergraduate upper-level laboratory, a five-week set of exercises was designed to allow students to examine the CRISPR status of uncharacterized Escherichia coli strains and to allow the discovery of new repeats and spacers. Students started the project by isolating genomic DNA from E. coli and amplifying the iap CRISPR locus using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR products were analyzed by Sanger DNA sequencing, and the sequences were examined for the presence of CRISPR repeat sequences. The regions between the repeats, the spacers, were extracted and analyzed with BLASTN searches. Overall, CRISPR loci were sequenced from several previously uncharacterized E. coli strains and one E. coli K-12 strain. Sanger DNA sequencing resulted in the discovery of 36 spacer sequences and their corresponding surrounding repeat sequences. Five of the spacers were homologous to foreign (non-E. coli) DNA. Assessment of the laboratory indicates that improvements were made in the ability of students to answer questions relating to the structure and function of CRISPRs. Future directions of the laboratory are presented and discussed. © 2016 by The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 45(3):262-269, 2017.	KT Militello|JC Lazatin
27676450	Cellobiose phosphorylase (CBP) cleaves cellobiose-abundant in plant biomass-to glucose and glucose 1-phosphate. However, the pentose sugar xylose, also abundant in plant biomass, acts as a mixed-inhibitor and a substrate for the reverse reaction, limiting the industrial potential of CBP. Preventing xylose, which lacks only a single hydroxymethyl group relative to glucose, from binding to the CBP active site poses a spatial challenge for protein engineering, since simple steric occlusion cannot be used to block xylose binding without also preventing glucose binding. Using CRISPR-based chromosomal library selection, we identified a distal mutation in CBP, Y47H, responsible for improved cellobiose consumption in the presence of xylose. In silico analysis suggests this mutation may alter the conformation of the cellobiose phosphorylase dimer complex to reduce xylose binding to the active site. These results may aid in engineering carbohydrate phosphorylases for improved specificity in biofuel production, and also in the production of industrially important oligosaccharides.

27669025	Bacterial adaptive immune systems use CRISPRs (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins for RNA-guided nucleic acid cleavage. Although most prokaryotic adaptive immune systems generally target DNA substrates, type III and VI CRISPR systems direct interference complexes against single-stranded RNA substrates. In type VI systems, the single-subunit C2c2 protein functions as an RNA-guided RNA endonuclease (RNase). How this enzyme acquires mature CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) that are essential for immune surveillance and how it carries out crRNA-mediated RNA cleavage remain unclear. Here we show that bacterial C2c2 possesses a unique RNase activity responsible for CRISPR RNA maturation that is distinct from its RNA-activated single-stranded RNA degradation activity. These dual RNase functions are chemically and mechanistically different from each other and from the crRNA-processing behaviour of the evolutionarily unrelated CRISPR enzyme Cpf1 (ref. 11). The two RNase activities of C2c2 enable multiplexed processing and loading of guide RNAs that in turn allow sensitive detection of cellular transcripts.

27668807	Muscle weakness, the most common symptom of neuromuscular disease, may result from muscle dysfunction or may be caused indirectly by neuronal and neuromuscular junction abnormalities. To date, more than 780 monogenic neuromuscular diseases, linked to 417 different genes, have been identified in humans. Genome-editing methods, especially the CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-Cas9 (CRISPR-associated protein 9) system, hold clinical potential for curing many monogenic disorders, including neuromuscular diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and myotonic dystrophy type 1.	To provide an overview of genome-editing approaches; to summarize published reports on the feasibility, efficacy, and safety of current genome-editing methods as they relate to the potential correction of monogenic neuromuscular diseases; and to highlight scientific and clinical opportunities and obstacles toward permanent correction of disease-causing mutations responsible for monogenic neuromuscular diseases by genome editing.	PubMed and Google Scholar were searched for articles published from June 30, 1989, through June 9, 2016, using the following keywords: genome editing, CRISPR-Cas9, neuromuscular disease, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and myotonic dystrophy type 1. The following sources were reviewed: 341 articles describing different approaches to edit mammalian genomes; 330 articles describing CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing in cell culture lines (in vitro) and animal models (in vivo); 16 websites used to generate single-guide RNA; 4 websites for off-target effects; and 382 articles describing viral and nonviral delivery systems. Articles describing neuromuscular diseases, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and myotonic dystrophy type 1, were also reviewed.	Multiple proof-of-concept studies reveal the feasibility and efficacy of genome-editing-meditated correction of monogenic neuromuscular diseases in cultured cells and animal models.	Genome editing is a rapidly evolving technology with enormous translational potential once efficacy, delivery, and safety issues are addressed. The clinical impact of this technology is that genome editing can permanently correct disease-causing mutations and circumvent the hurdles of traditional gene- and cell-based therapies.

27667664	Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) is the major pathway for ATP production in humans. Deficiencies in OXPHOS can arise from mutations in either mitochondrial or nuclear genomes and comprise the largest collection of inborn errors of metabolism. At present we lack a complete catalog of human genes and pathways essential for OXPHOS. Here we introduce a genome-wide CRISPR "death screen" that actively selects dying cells to reveal human genes required for OXPHOS, inspired by the classic observation that human cells deficient in OXPHOS survive in glucose but die in galactose. We report 191 high-confidence hits essential for OXPHOS, including 72 underlying known OXPHOS diseases. Our screen reveals a functional module consisting of NGRN, WBSCR16, RPUSD3, RPUSD4, TRUB2, and FASTKD2 that regulates the mitochondrial 16S rRNA and intra-mitochondrial translation. Our work yields a rich catalog of genes required for OXPHOS and, more generally, demonstrates the power of death screening for functional genomic analysis.

27666594	Mitochondrial diseases comprise a heterogeneous group of genetically inherited disorders that cause failures in energetic and metabolic function. Boosting residual oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) activity can partially correct these failures. Herein, using a high-throughput chemical screen, we identified the bromodomain inhibitor I-BET 525762A as one of the top hits that increases COX5a protein levels in complex I (CI) mutant cybrid cells. In parallel, bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4), a target of I-BET 525762A, was identified using a genome-wide CRISPR screen to search for genes whose loss of function rescues death of CI-impaired cybrids grown under conditions requiring OXPHOS activity for survival. We show that I-BET525762A or loss of BRD4 remodeled the mitochondrial proteome to increase the levels and activity of OXPHOS protein complexes, leading to rescue of the bioenergetic defects and cell death caused by mutations or chemical inhibition of CI. These studies show that BRD4 inhibition may have therapeutic implications for the treatment of mitochondrial diseases.

27662091	Mammalian DNA methylation is a critical epigenetic mechanism orchestrating gene expression networks in many biological processes. However, investigation of the functions of specific methylation events remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate that fusion of Tet1 or Dnmt3a with a catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9) enables targeted DNA methylation editing. Targeting of the dCas9-Tet1 or -Dnmt3a fusion protein to methylated or unmethylated promoter sequences caused activation or silencing, respectively, of an endogenous reporter. Targeted demethylation of the BDNF promoter IV or the MyoD distal enhancer by dCas9-Tet1 induced BDNF expression in post-mitotic neurons or activated MyoD facilitating reprogramming of fibroblasts into myoblasts, respectively. Targeted de novo methylation of a CTCF loop anchor site by dCas9-Dnmt3a blocked CTCF binding and interfered with DNA looping, causing altered gene expression in the neighboring loop. Finally, we show that these tools can edit DNA methylation in mice, demonstrating their wide utility for functional studies of epigenetic regulation.

27655312	Chinese scientists have made significant achievements in the field of animal genetics in 2015. Incomplete statistics show that among all the publications of 2015 involving nematode (Caenorhabditis elegans), fly (Drosophila melanogaster), zebrafish (Danio rerio), African clawed frog (Xenopus) or mice (Mus musculus), about 1/5 publications are from China. Many innovative studies were published in high-impact international academic journals by Chinese scientists, including the identification of a putative magnetic receptor MagR, the genetic basis for the regulation of wing polyphenism in the insect brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens), DNA N6-methyladenine (6mA) modification in the Drosophila genome, a novel molecular mechanism regarding the dendritic spine pruning and maturation in the mammals, the mechanism for the CREB coactivator CRTC2 in the regulation of hepatic lipid metabolism, the control of systemic inflammation by neurotransmitter dopamine, the role of Gasdermin protein family in triggering pyroptosis, a parvalbumin-positive excitatory visual pathway to trigger fear responses in mice, etc. Chinese scientists have also made important contributions in genome editing via TALEN or CRISPR/Cas system. According to incomplete statistics, more than 1/5 of the publications related to genome editing in 2015 are from China, where a variety of animals with different approaches were targeted, ranging from the worm to primates. Particularly, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in human tripronuclear zygotes was successfully achieved for the first time. China has been one of the leading countries in genome sequencing in recent years, and Chinese scientists reported the sequence and annotation of the genomes of several important animal species in 2015, including goose (Anser cygnoides), Schlegel's Japanese Gecko (Gekko japonicus), grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus), large yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea) and pig (Sus scrofa). They further analyzed the genome-wide genetic basis of the species-specific physiological and pathological characteristics as well as their adaptation to environmental conditions. In this review, we make a first attempt to summarize the research advances on animal genetics in China in 2015, with an emphasis on the achievements led by Chinese scientists and carried out in Chinese institutions. We will briefly discuss the significance of their research and contributions of Chinese scientists in animal genetics.	B Zhang|XF Chen|X Huang|X Yang

27651888	Cellular models of muscle disease are taking on increasing importance with the large number of genes and mutations implicated in causing myopathies and the concomitant need to test personalized therapies. Developing cell models relies on having an easily obtained source of cells, and if the cells are not derived from muscle itself, a robust reprogramming process is needed. Fibroblasts are a human cell source that works well for the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells, which can then be differentiated into cardiomyocyte lineages, and with less efficiency, skeletal muscle-like lineages. Alternatively, direct reprogramming with the transcription factor MyoD has been used to generate myotubes from cultured human fibroblasts. Although useful, fibroblasts require a skin biopsy to obtain and this can limit their access, especially from pediatric populations.	We now demonstrate that direct reprogramming of urine-derived cells is a highly efficient and reproducible process that can be used to establish human myogenic cells. We show that this method can be applied to urine cells derived from normal individuals as well as those with muscle diseases. Furthermore, we show that urine-derived cells can be edited using CRISPR/Cas9 technology.	With progress in understanding the molecular etiology of human muscle diseases, having a readily available, noninvasive source of cells from which to generate muscle-like cells is highly useful.

27641836	Clostridium pasteurianum is emerging as a prospective host for the production of biofuels and chemicals, and has recently been shown to directly consume electric current. Despite this growing biotechnological appeal, the organism's genetics and central metabolism remain poorly understood. Here we present a concurrent genome sequence for the C. pasteurianum type strain and provide extensive genomic analysis of the organism's defence mechanisms and central fermentative metabolism. Next generation genome sequencing produced reads corresponding to spontaneous excision of a novel phage, designated φ6013, which could be induced using mitomycin C and detected using PCR and transmission electron microscopy. Methylome analysis of sequencing reads provided a near-complete glimpse into the organism's restriction-modification systems. We also unveiled the chief C. pasteurianum Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) locus, which was found to exemplify a Type I-B system. Finally, we show that C. pasteurianum possesses a highly complex fermentative metabolism whereby the metabolic pathways enlisted by the cell is governed by the degree of reductance of the substrate. Four distinct fermentation profiles, ranging from exclusively acidogenic to predominantly alcohologenic, were observed through redox consideration of the substrate. A detailed discussion of the organism's central metabolism within the context of metabolic engineering is provided.	ME Pyne|X Liu|M Moo-Young|DA Chung|CP Chou
27637196	After discovering the CRISPR-Cas9 as an extraordinary method for Gene editing it is necessary to reflect on the ethical, political and legal impact of this technology. This work pretends to offer a preliminary consideration of these problems. I do not pay attention to the potential of CRISPR-Cas9 in the fields of health or environment, nor to all the ethical, legal and political challenges it involves. I principally focus the attention on the possibility of using CRISPR-Cas9 to alter the human germ line. There are some rulings on this topic delivered by intergovernmental organizations. There also are some statements from the scientific community on the matter. They are important in order to know the reasons why they propose a moratorium on the use of CRISPR-Cas9 for human germ line editing. I begin the paper with a short explanation on how CRISPR-Cas9 works.	V Bellver Capella

27632008	The conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex is a key evolutionally conserved multisubunit protein machinery that regulates tethering and fusion of intra-Golgi transport vesicles. The Golgi apparatus specifically promotes sorting and complex glycosylation of glycoconjugates. Without proper glycosylation and processing, proteins and lipids will be mislocalized and/or have impaired function. The Golgi glycosylation machinery is kept in homeostasis by a careful balance of anterograde and retrograde trafficking to ensure proper localization of the glycosylation enzymes and their substrates. This balance, like other steps of membrane trafficking, is maintained by vesicle trafficking machinery that includes COPI vesicular coat proteins, SNAREs, Rabs, and both coiled-coil and multi-subunit vesicular tethers. The COG complex interacts with other membrane trafficking components and is essential for proper localization of Golgi glycosylation machinery. Here we describe using CRISPR-mediated gene editing coupled with a phenotype-based selection strategy directly linked to the COG complex's role in glycosylation homeostasis to obtain COG complex subunit knockouts (KOs). This has resulted in clonal KOs for each COG subunit in HEK293T cells and gives the ability to further probe the role of the COG complex in Golgi homeostasis.	JB Blackburn|VV Lupashin
27626652	Prokaryotic adaptive immune systems are composed of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins. These systems adapt to new threats by integrating short nucleic acids, termed spacers, into the CRISPR array. The functional motifs in the repeat and the mechanism by which a constant repeat size is maintained are still elusive. Here, through a series of mutations within the repeat of the CRISPR-Cas type I-E, we identify motifs that are crucial for adaptation and show that they serve as anchor sites for two molecular rulers determining the size of the new repeat. Adaptation products from various repeat mutants support a model in which two motifs in the repeat bind to two different sites in the adaptation complex that are 8 and 16 bp away from the active site. This model significantly extends our understanding of the adaptation process and broadens the scope of its applications.	MG Goren|S Doron|R Globus|G Amitai|R Sorek|U Qimron
27618611	Sequence-specific nucleases have been exploited to create targeted gene knockouts in various plants(1), but replacing a fragment and even obtaining gene insertions at specific loci in plant genomes remain a serious challenge. Here, we report efficient intron-mediated site-specific gene replacement and insertion approaches that generate mutations using the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) system. Using a pair of single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting adjacent introns and a donor DNA template including the same pair of sgRNA sites, we achieved gene replacements in the rice endogenous gene 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) at a frequency of 2.0%. We also obtained targeted gene insertions at a frequency of 2.2% using a sgRNA targeting one intron and a donor DNA template including the same sgRNA site. Rice plants harbouring the OsEPSPS gene with the intended substitutions were glyphosate-resistant. Furthermore, the site-specific gene replacements and insertions were faithfully transmitted to the next generation. These newly developed approaches can be generally used to replace targeted gene fragments and to insert exogenous DNA sequences into specific genomic sites in rice and other plants.

27618488	CRISPR-Cas systems defend prokaryotes against viruses and plasmids. Short DNA segments of the invader, known as spacers, are stored in the CRISPR array as immunological memories. New spacers are added invariably to the 5' end of the array; therefore, the first spacer matches the latest foreign threat. Whether this highly polarized order of spacer insertion influences CRISPR-Cas immunity has not been explored. Here we show that a conserved sequence located immediately upstream of the CRISPR array specifies the site of new spacer integration. Mutation of this sequence results in erroneous incorporation of new spacers into the middle of the array. We show that spacers added through polarized acquisition give rise to more robust CRISPR-Cas immunity than spacers added to the middle of the array. This study demonstrates that the CRISPR-Cas system specifies the site of spacer integration to optimize the immune response against the most immediate threat to the host.	J McGinn|LA Marraffini
27618485	Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are an emerging class of transcripts that can modulate gene expression; however, their mechanisms of action remain poorly understood. Here, we experimentally determine the secondary structure of Braveheart (Bvht) using chemical probing methods and show that this ∼590 nt transcript has a modular fold. Using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated editing of mouse embryonic stem cells, we find that deletion of 11 nt in a 5' asymmetric G-rich internal loop (AGIL) of Bvht (bvhtdAGIL) dramatically impairs cardiomyocyte differentiation. We demonstrate a specific interaction between AGIL and cellular nucleic acid binding protein (CNBP/ZNF9), a zinc-finger protein known to bind single-stranded G-rich sequences. We further show that CNBP deletion partially rescues the bvhtdAGIL mutant phenotype by restoring differentiation capacity. Together, our work shows that Bvht functions with CNBP through a well-defined RNA motif to regulate cardiovascular lineage commitment, opening the door for exploring broader roles of RNA structure in development and disease.

27616359	Clustered regularly-interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) is a new and effective genetic editing tool. CRISPR was initially found in bacteria to protect it from virus invasions. In the first step, specific DNA strands of virus are identified by guide RNA that is composed of crRNA and tracrRNA. Then RNAse III is required for producing crRNA from pre-crRNA. In The second step, a crRNA:tracrRNA:Cas9 complex guides RNase III to cleave target DNA. After cleavage of DNA by CRISPR-Cas9, DNA can be fixed by Non- Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) and Homology Directed Repair (HDR). Whereas NHEJ is simple and random, HDR is much more complex and accurate. Gene editing by CRISPR is able to be applied to various biological field such as agriculture and treating genetic diseases in human. [BMB Reports 2017; 50(1): 20-24].

27614072	Successful RNAi applications depend on strategies allowing robust and persistent expression of minimal gene silencing triggers without perturbing endogenous gene expression. Here, we propose a novel avenue which is integration of a promoterless shmiRNA, i.e. a shRNA embedded in a micro-RNA (miRNA) scaffold, into an engineered genomic miRNA locus. For proof-of-concept, we used TALE or CRISPR/Cas9 nucleases to site-specifically integrate an anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) shmiRNA into the liver-specific miR-122/hcr locus in hepatoma cells, with the aim to obtain cellular clones that are genetically protected against HCV infection. Using reporter assays, Northern blotting and qRT-PCR, we confirmed anti-HCV shmiRNA expression as well as miR-122 integrity and functionality in selected cellular progeny. Moreover, we employed a comprehensive battery of PCR, cDNA/miRNA profiling and whole genome sequencing analyses to validate targeted integration of a single shmiRNA molecule at the expected position, and to rule out deleterious effects on the genomes or transcriptomes of the engineered cells. Importantly, a subgenomic HCV replicon and a full-length reporter virus, but not a Dengue virus control, were significantly impaired in the modified cells. Our original combination of DNA engineering and RNAi expression technologies benefits numerous applications, from miRNA, genome and transgenesis research, to human gene therapy.

27611571	The polymicrobial biofilm communities in Mushroom and Octopus Spring in Yellowstone National Park (YNP) are well characterized, yet little is known about the phage populations. Dominant species, Synechococcus sp. JA-2-3B'a(2-13), Synechococcus sp. JA-3-3Ab, Chloroflexus sp. Y-400-fl, and Roseiflexus sp. RS-1, contain multiple CRISPR-Cas arrays, suggesting complex interactions with phage predators. To analyze phage populations from Octopus Spring biofilms, we sequenced a viral enriched fraction. To assemble and analyze phage metagenomic data, we developed a custom module, VIRITAS, implemented within the MetAMOS framework. This module bins contigs into groups based on tetranucleotide frequencies and CRISPR spacer-protospacer matching and ORF calling. Using this pipeline we were able to assemble phage sequences into contigs and bin them into three clusters that corroborated with their potential host range. The virome contained 52,348 predicted ORFs; some were clearly phage-like; 9319 ORFs had a recognizable Pfam domain while the rest were hypothetical. Of the recognized domains with CRISPR spacer matches, was the phage endolysin used by lytic phage to disrupt cells. Analysis of the endolysins present in the thermophilic cyanophage contigs revealed a subset of characterized endolysins as well as a Glyco_hydro_108 (PF05838) domain not previously associated with sequenced cyanophages. A search for CRISPR spacer matches to all identified phage endolysins demonstrated that a majority of endolysin domains were targets. This strategy provides a general way to link host and phage as endolysins are known to be widely distributed in bacteriophage. Endolysins can also provide information about host cell wall composition and have the additional potential to be used as targets for novel therapeutics.	M Davison|TJ Treangen|S Koren|M Pop|D Bhaya
27609886	Inhibitory synapses dampen neuronal activity through postsynaptic hyperpolarization. The composition of the inhibitory postsynapse and the mechanistic basis of its regulation, however, remain poorly understood. We used an in vivo chemico-genetic proximity-labeling approach to discover inhibitory postsynaptic proteins. Quantitative mass spectrometry not only recapitulated known inhibitory postsynaptic proteins but also revealed a large network of new proteins, many of which are either implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders or are of unknown function. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) depletion of one of these previously uncharacterized proteins, InSyn1, led to decreased postsynaptic inhibitory sites, reduced the frequency of miniature inhibitory currents, and increased excitability in the hippocampus. Our findings uncover a rich and functionally diverse assemblage of previously unknown proteins that regulate postsynaptic inhibition and might contribute to developmental brain disorders.

27605615	During embryonic development, regulation of gene expression is key to creating the many subtypes of cells that an organism needs throughout its lifetime. Recent work has shown that maternal genetics and environmental factors have lifelong consequences on diverse processes ranging from immune function to stress responses. The RE1-silencing transcription factor (Rest) is a transcriptional repressor that interacts with chromatin-modifying complexes to repress transcription of neural-specific genes during early development. Here we show that in zebrafish, maternally supplied rest regulates expression of target genes during larval development and has lifelong impacts on behavior. Larvae deprived of maternal rest are hyperactive and show atypical spatial preferences. Adult male fish deprived of maternal rest present with atypical spatial preferences in a novel environment assay. Transcriptome sequencing revealed 158 genes that are repressed by maternal rest in blastula stage embryos. Furthermore, we found that maternal rest is required for target gene repression until at least 6 dpf. Importantly, disruption of the RE1 sites in either snap25a or snap25b resulted in behaviors that recapitulate the hyperactivity phenotype caused by absence of maternal rest Both maternal rest mutants and snap25a RE1 site mutants have altered primary motor neuron architecture that may account for the enhanced locomotor activity. These results demonstrate that maternal rest represses snap25a/b to modulate larval behavior and that early Rest activity has lifelong behavioral impacts.	Maternal factors deposited in the oocyte have well-established roles during embryonic development. We show that, in zebrafish, maternal rest (RE1-silencing transcription factor) regulates expression of target genes during larval development and has lifelong impacts on behavior. The Rest transcriptional repressor interacts with chromatin-modifying complexes to limit transcription of neural genes. We identify several synaptic genes that are repressed by maternal Rest and demonstrate that snap25a/b are key targets of maternal rest that modulate larval locomotor activity. These results reveal that zygotic rest is unable to compensate for deficits in maternally supplied rest and uncovers novel temporal requirements for Rest activity, which has implications for the broad roles of Rest-mediated repression during neural development and in disease states.

27599840	A hallmark of defense mechanisms based on clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and associated sequences (Cas) are the crRNAs that guide these complexes in the destruction of invading DNA or RNA. Three separate CRISPR-Cas systems exist in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Based on genetic and transcriptomic evidence, two associated endoribonucleases, Cas6-1 and Cas6-2a, were postulated to be involved in crRNA maturation from CRISPR1 or CRISPR2, respectively. Here, we report a promiscuity of both enzymes to process in vitro not only their cognate transcripts, but also the respective non-cognate precursors, whereas they are specific in vivo Moreover, while most of the repeats serving as substrates were cleaved in vitro, some were not. RNA structure predictions suggested that the context sequence surrounding a repeat can interfere with its stable folding. Indeed, structure accuracy calculations of the hairpin motifs within the repeat sequences explained the majority of analyzed cleavage reactions, making this a good measure for predicting successful cleavage events. We conclude that the cleavage of CRISPR1 and CRISPR2 repeat instances requires a stable formation of the characteristic hairpin motif, which is similar between the two types of repeats. The influence of surrounding sequences might partially explain variations in crRNA abundances and should be considered when designing artificial CRISPR arrays.

27596864	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) are important genetic elements in many bacterial and archaeal genomes, and play a key role in prokaryote immune systems' fight against invasive foreign elements. The CRISPR system has also been engineered to facilitate target gene editing in eukaryotic genomes. Using the common features of mis-annotated CRISPRs in prokaryotic genomes, this study proposed an accurate de novo CRISPR annotation program CRISPRdigger, which can take a partially assembled genome as its input. A comprehensive comparison with the three existing programs demonstrated that CRISPRdigger can recover more Direct Repeats (DRs) for CRISPRs and achieve a higher accuracy for a query genome.

27595403	We present tRNA-based vectors for producing multiple clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) from a single RNA polymerase II or III transcript in Drosophila. The system, which is based on liberation of sgRNAs by processing flanking tRNAs, permits highly efficient multiplexing of Cas9-based mutagenesis. We also demonstrate that the tRNA-sgRNA system markedly increases the efficacy of conditional gene disruption by Cas9 and can promote editing by the recently discovered RNA-guided endonuclease Cpf1.

27595346	Bacterial CRISPR-Cas systems include genomic arrays of short repeats flanking foreign DNA sequences and provide adaptive immunity against viruses. Integration of foreign DNA must occur specifically to avoid damaging the genome or the CRISPR array, but surprisingly promiscuous activity occurs in vitro. Here we reconstituted full-site DNA integration and show that the Streptococcus pyogenes type II-A Cas1-Cas2 integrase maintains specificity in part through limitations on the second integration step. At non-CRISPR sites, integration stalls at the half-site intermediate, thereby enabling reaction reversal. S. pyogenes Cas1-Cas2 is highly specific for the leader-proximal repeat and recognizes the repeat's palindromic ends, thus fitting a model of independent recognition by distal Cas1 active sites. These findings suggest that DNA-insertion sites are less common than suggested by previous work, thereby preventing toxicity during CRISPR immune adaptation and maintaining host genome integrity.

27594589	The ability to reliably express fluorescent reporters or other genes of interest is important for using human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) as a platform for investigating cell fates and gene function. We describe a simple expression system, designated GAPTrap (GT), in which reporter genes, including GFP, mCherry, mTagBFP2, luc2, Gluc, and lacZ are inserted into the GAPDH locus in hPSCs. Independent clones harboring variations of the GT vectors expressed remarkably consistent levels of the reporter gene. Differentiation experiments showed that reporter expression was reliably maintained in hematopoietic cells, cardiac mesoderm, definitive endoderm, and ventral midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Similarly, analysis of teratomas derived from GT-lacZ hPSCs showed that β-galactosidase expression was maintained in a spectrum of cell types representing derivatives of the three germ layers. Thus, the GAPTrap vectors represent a robust and straightforward tagging system that enables indelible labeling of PSCs and their differentiated derivatives.

27594426	Apicomplexan parasites are leading causes of human and livestock diseases such as malaria and toxoplasmosis, yet most of their genes remain uncharacterized. Here, we present the first genome-wide genetic screen of an apicomplexan. We adapted CRISPR/Cas9 to assess the contribution of each gene from the parasite Toxoplasma gondii during infection of human fibroblasts. Our analysis defines ∼200 previously uncharacterized, fitness-conferring genes unique to the phylum, from which 16 were investigated, revealing essential functions during infection of human cells. Secondary screens identify as an invasion factor the claudin-like apicomplexan microneme protein (CLAMP), which resembles mammalian tight-junction proteins and localizes to secretory organelles, making it critical to the initiation of infection. CLAMP is present throughout sequenced apicomplexan genomes and is essential during the asexual stages of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. These results provide broad-based functional information on T. gondii genes and will facilitate future approaches to expand the horizon of antiparasitic interventions.

27590160	We established an in vitro culture model in which intestinal epithelial stem cells can grow into three-dimensional, ever-expanding epithelial organoids that retain their original organ identity and genetic stability. Moreover, organoids can easily be genetically modified using different genome modification strategies, including viral delivery of transgenes and CRISPR/Cas9 technology. These combined characteristics make them a useful in vitro model system to study many biological processes including the contribution of cellular signaling pathways to tissue homeostasis and disease. Here we describe our current laboratory protocols to establish human intestinal organoids and how to genetically modify both mouse and human intestinal organoids to study cellular signaling pathways, specifically Wnt signaling. Moreover, we provide a detailed protocol for lentiviral transduction and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome modification of organoid cultures.	J Drost|B Artegiani|H Clevers
27587677	The CRISPR-Cas system is an adaptive immune system in many archaea and bacteria, which provides resistance against invading genetic elements. The first phase of CRISPR-Cas immunity is called adaptation, in which small DNA fragments are excised from genetic elements and are inserted into a CRISPR array generally adjacent to its so called leader sequence at one end of the array. It has been shown that transcription initiation and adaptation signals of the CRISPR array are located within the leader. However, apart from promoters, there is very little knowledge of sequence or structural motifs or their possible functions. Leader properties have mainly been characterized through transcriptional initiation data from single organisms but large-scale characterization of leaders has remained challenging due to their low level of sequence conservation.	We developed a method to successfully detect leader sequences by focusing on the consensus repeat of the adjacent CRISPR array and weak upstream conservation signals. We applied our tool to the analysis of a comprehensive genomic database and identified several characteristic properties of leader sequences specific to archaea and bacteria, ranging from distinctive sizes to preferential indel localization. CRISPRleader provides a full annotation of the CRISPR array, its strand orientation as well as conserved core leader boundaries that can be uploaded to any genome browser. In addition, it outputs reader-friendly HTML pages for conserved leader clusters from our database.

27587670	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and associated proteins (CRISPR-Cas) allows more specific and efficient gene editing than all previous genetic engineering systems. These exciting discoveries stem from the finding of the CRISPR system being an adaptive immune system that protects the prokaryotes against exogenous genetic elements such as phages. Despite the exciting discoveries, almost all knowledge about CRISPRs is based only on microorganisms that can be isolated, cultured and sequenced in labs. However, about 95% of bacterial species cannot be cultured in labs. The fast accumulation of metagenomic data, which contains DNA sequences of microbial species from natural samples, provides a unique opportunity for CRISPR annotation in uncultivable microbial species. However, the large amount of data, heterogeneous coverage and shared leader sequences of some CRISPRs pose challenges for identifying CRISPRs efficiently in metagenomic data.	In this study, we developed a CRISPR finding tool for metagenomic data without relying on generic assembly, which is error-prone and computationally expensive for complex data. Our tool can run on commonly available machines in small labs. It employs properties of CRISPRs to decompose generic assembly into local assembly. We tested it on both mock and real metagenomic data and benchmarked the performance with state-of-the-art tools.

27586395	The clustered regularly-interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) structural family functions as an acquired immune system in prokaryotes. Gene editing techniques have co-opted CRISPR and the associated Cas nucleases to allow for the precise genetic modification of human cells, zebrafish, mice, and other eukaryotes. Indeed, this approach has been used to induce a variety of modifications including directed insertion/deletion (InDel) of bases, gene knock-in, introduction of mutations in both alleles of a target gene, and deletion of small DNA fragments. Thus, CRISPR technology offers a precise molecular tool for directed genome modification with a range of potential applications; further, its high mutation efficiency, simple process, and low cost provide additional advantages over prior editing techniques. This paper will provide an overview of the basic structure and function of the CRISPR gene editing system as well as current and potential applications to research on parasites.	Y Cui|L Yu
27585307	Fulminant hepatic failure is a life-threatening disease which occurs in patients without preexisting liver disease. Nowadays, there is no ideal therapeutic tool in the treatment of fulminant hepatic failure. Recent studies suggested that a novel technology termed CRISPR/Cas9 may be a promising approach for the treatment of fulminant hepatic failure. In this project, we have designed single chimeric guide RNAs specifically targeting the genomic regions of mouse Fas gene. The in vitro and in vivo effects of sgRNAs on the production of Fas protein were examined in cultured mouse cells and in a hydrodynamic injection-based mouse model, respectively. The in vivo delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 could maintain liver homeostasis and protect hepatocytes from Fas-mediated cell apoptosis in the fulminant hepatic failure model. Our study indicates the clinical potential of developing the CRISPR/Cas9 system as a novel therapeutic strategy to rescue Concanavalin-A-induced fulminant hepatic failure in the mouse model. J. Cell.

27582008	CRISPR-Cas immune systems defend prokaryotes against viruses and plasmids. CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) associate with various CRISPR-associated (Cas) protein modules to form structurally and functionally diverse (Type I-VI) crRNP immune effector complexes. Previously, we identified three, co-existing effector complexes in Pyrococcus furiosus -Type I-A (Csa), Type I-G (Cst), and Type III-B (Cmr)-and demonstrated that each complex functions in vivo to eliminate invader DNA. Here, we reconstitute functional Cst crRNP complexes in vitro from recombinant Cas proteins and synthetic crRNAs and investigate mechanisms of crRNP assembly and invader DNA recognition and destruction. All four known Cst-affiliated Cas proteins (Cas5t, Cst1, Cst2, and Cas3) are required for activity, but each subunit plays a distinct role. Cas5t and Cst2 comprise a minimal set of proteins that selectively interact with crRNA. Further addition of Cst1, enables the four subunit crRNP (Cas5t, Cst1, Cst2, crRNA) to specifically bind complementary, double-stranded DNA targets and to recruit the Cas3 effector nuclease, which catalyzes cleavages at specific sites within the displaced, non-target DNA strand. Our results indicate that Type I-G crRNPs selectively bind target DNA in a crRNA and, protospacer adjacent motif dependent manner to recruit a dedicated Cas3 nuclease for invader DNA destruction.

27581884	Migration of hosts and parasites can have a profound impact on host-parasite ecological and evolutionary interactions. Using the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa UCBPP-PA14 and its phage DMS3vir, we here show that immigration of naive hosts into coevolving populations of hosts and parasites can influence the mechanistic basis underlying host defence evolution. Specifically, we found that at high levels of bacterial immigration, bacteria switched from clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR-Cas) to surface modification-mediated defence. This effect emerges from an increase in the force of infection, which tips the balance from CRISPR to surface modification-based defence owing to the induced and fixed fitness costs associated with these mechanisms, respectively.

27576538	Virulent strains of Clostridium difficile have become a global health problem associated with morbidity and mortality. Traditional typing methods do not provide ideal resolution to track outbreak strains, ascertain genetic diversity between isolates, or monitor the phylogeny of this species on a global basis. Here, we investigate the occurrence and diversity of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated genes (cas) in C. difficile to assess the potential of CRISPR-based phylogeny and high-resolution genotyping. A single Type-IB CRISPR-Cas system was identified in 217 analyzed genomes with cas gene clusters present at conserved chromosomal locations, suggesting vertical evolution of the system, assessing a total of 1,865 CRISPR arrays. The CRISPR arrays, markedly enriched (8.5 arrays/genome) compared with other species, occur both at conserved and variable locations across strains, and thus provide a basis for typing based on locus occurrence and spacer polymorphism. Clustering of strains by array composition correlated with sequence type (ST) analysis. Spacer content and polymorphism within conserved CRISPR arrays revealed phylogenetic relationship across clades and within ST. Spacer polymorphisms of conserved arrays were instrumental for differentiating closely related strains, e.g., ST1/RT027/B1 strains and pathogenicity locus encoding ST3/RT001 strains. CRISPR spacers showed sequence similarity to phage sequences, which is consistent with the native role of CRISPR-Cas as adaptive immune systems in bacteria. Overall, CRISPR-Cas sequences constitute a valuable basis for genotyping of C. difficile isolates, provide insights into the micro-evolutionary events that occur between closely related strains, and reflect the evolutionary trajectory of these genomes.

27575999	In invertebrate eukaryotes and prokaryotes, respectively, the RNAi and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-CRISPR-associated (CRISPR-Cas) pathways are highly specific and efficient RNA and DNA interference systems, and are well characterised as potent antiviral systems. It has become possible to recruit or reconstitute these pathways in mammalian cells, where they can be directed against desired host or viral targets. The RNAi and CRISPR-Cas systems can therefore yield ideal antiviral therapeutics, capable of specific and efficient viral inhibition with minimal off-target effects, but development of such therapeutics can be slow. This review covers recent advances made towards developing RNAi or CRISPR-Cas strategies for clinical use. These studies address the delivery, toxicity or target design issues that typically plague the in vivo or clinical use of these technologies.	WX Chin|SK Ang|JJ Chu
27574023	A major objective in biological research is to understand spatial and temporal requirements for any given gene, especially in dynamic processes acting over short periods, such as catalytically driven reactions, subcellular transport, cell division, cell rearrangement and cell migration. The interrogation of such processes requires the use of rapid and flexible methods of interfering with gene function. However, many of the most widely used interventional approaches, such as RNAi or CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-Cas9 (CRISPR-associated 9), operate at the level of the gene or its transcripts, meaning that the effects of gene perturbation are exhibited over longer time frames than the process under investigation. There has been much activity over the last few years to address this fundamental problem. In the present review, we describe recent advances in disruption technologies acting at the level of the expressed protein, involving inducible methods of protein cleavage, (in)activation, protein sequestration or degradation. Drawing on examples from model organisms we illustrate the utility of fast-acting techniques and discuss how different components of the molecular toolkit can be employed to dissect previously intractable biochemical processes and cellular behaviours.

27571369	Despite the importance of DNA methylation in health and disease, technologies to readily manipulate methylation of specific sequences for functional analysis and therapeutic purposes are lacking. Here we adapt the previously described dCas9-SunTag for efficient, targeted demethylation of specific DNA loci. The original SunTag consists of ten copies of the GCN4 peptide separated by 5-amino-acid linkers. To achieve efficient recruitment of an anti-GCN4 scFv fused to the ten-eleven (TET) 1 hydroxylase, which induces demethylation, we changed the linker length to 22 amino acids. The system attains demethylation efficiencies >50% in seven out of nine loci tested. Four of these seven loci showed demethylation of >90%. We demonstrate targeted demethylation of CpGs in regulatory regions and demethylation-dependent 1.7- to 50-fold upregulation of associated genes both in cell culture (embryonic stem cells, cancer cell lines, primary neural precursor cells) and in vivo in mouse fetuses.

27562951	The rapid development of programmable nuclease-based genome editing technologies has enabled targeted gene disruption and correction both in vitro and in vivo This revolution opens up the possibility of precise genome editing at target genomic sites to modulate gene function in animals and plants. Among several programmable nucleases, the type II clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated nuclease 9 (Cas9) system has progressed remarkably in recent years, leading to its widespread use in research, medicine and biotechnology. In particular, CRISPR-Cas9 shows highly efficient gene editing activity for therapeutic purposes in systems ranging from patient stem cells to animal models. However, the development of therapeutic approaches and delivery methods remains a great challenge for biomedical applications. Herein, we review therapeutic applications that use the CRISPR-Cas9 system and discuss the possibilities and challenges ahead.	T Koo|JS Kim

27552230	Salmonella enterica infections continue to be a significant burden on public health worldwide. The ability of S. enterica to produce hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an important phenotypic characteristic used to screen and identify Salmonella with selective medium; however, H2S-negative Salmonella have recently emerged. In this study, the H2S phenotype of Salmonella isolates was confirmed, and the selected isolates were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing and molecular identification by multilocus sequence typing, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) analysis. The phs genetic operon was also analyzed. A total of 160 S. enterica serovar Aberdeen isolates were detected between 2005 and 2013 in China. Of them, seven non-H2S-producing isolates were detected. Notably, four samples yielded four pairs of isolates with different H2S phenotypes, simultaneously. The data demonstrated that H2S-negative isolates were genetically closely related to H2S-positive isolates. Three new spacers (Abe1, Abe2, and Abe3) were identified in CRISPR locus 1 in four pairs of isolates with different H2S phenotypes from the same samples. Sequence analysis revealed a new nonsense mutation at position 208 in the phsA gene of all non-H2S-producing isolates. Additionally, we describe a new screening procedure to avoid H2S-negative Salmonella, which would normally be overlooked during laboratory and hospital screening. The prevalence of this pathogen may be underestimated; therefore, it is important to focus on improving surveillance of this organism to control its spread.

27546791	The tumor suppressor protein 53BP1, a pivotal regulator of DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair, was first identified as a p53-interacting protein over two decades ago. However, its direct contributions to p53-dependent cellular activities remain undefined. Here, we reveal that 53BP1 stimulates genome-wide p53-dependent gene transactivation and repression events in response to ionizing radiation (IR) and synthetic p53 activation. 53BP1-dependent p53 modulation requires both auto-oligomerization and tandem-BRCT domain-mediated bivalent interactions with p53 and the ubiquitin-specific protease USP28. Loss of these activities results in inefficient p53-dependent cell-cycle checkpoint and exit responses. Furthermore, we demonstrate 53BP1-USP28 cooperation to be essential for normal p53-promoter element interactions and gene transactivation-associated events, yet dispensable for 53BP1-dependent DSB repair regulation. Collectively, our data provide a mechanistic explanation for 53BP1-p53 cooperation in controlling anti-tumorigenic cell-fate decisions and reveal these activities to be distinct and separable from 53BP1's regulation of DNA double-strand break repair pathway choice.

27546790	Prokaryotes use a mechanism called priming to update their CRISPR immunological memory to rapidly counter revisiting, mutated viruses, and plasmids. Here we have determined how new spacers are produced and selected for integration into the CRISPR array during priming. We show that Cas3 couples CRISPR interference to adaptation by producing DNA breakdown products that fuel the spacer integration process in a two-step, PAM-associated manner. The helicase-nuclease Cas3 pre-processes target DNA into fragments of about 30-100 nt enriched for thymine-stretches in their 3' ends. The Cas1-2 complex further processes these fragments and integrates them sequence-specifically into CRISPR repeats by coupling of a 3' cytosine of the fragment. Our results highlight that the selection of PAM-compliant spacers during priming is enhanced by the combined sequence specificities of Cas3 and the Cas1-2 complex, leading to an increased propensity of integrating functional CTT-containing spacers.

27543296	Adoption of a streamlined version of the bacterial clustered regular interspersed short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9 defense system has accelerated targeted genome engineering. The Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 protein, directed by a simplified, CRISPR-like single-guide RNA, catalyzes a double-stranded DNA break at a specific genomic site; subsequent repair by end joining can introduce mutagenic insertions or deletions, while repair by homologous recombination using an exogenous DNA template can incorporate new sequences at the target locus. However, the efficiency of Cas9-directed mutagenesis is low in Drosophila melanogaster Here, we describe a strategy that reduces the time and effort required to identify flies with targeted genomic changes. The strategy uses editing of the white gene, evidenced by altered eye color, to predict successful editing of an unrelated gene-of-interest. The red eyes of wild-type flies are readily distinguished from white-eyed (end-joining-mediated loss of White function) or brown-eyed (recombination-mediated conversion to the whitecoffee allele) mutant flies. When single injected G0 flies produce individual G1 broods, flies carrying edits at a gene-of-interest were readily found in broods in which all G1 offspring carried white mutations. Thus, visual assessment of eye color substitutes for wholesale PCR screening of large numbers of G1 offspring. We find that end-joining-mediated mutations often show signatures of microhomology-mediated repair and that recombination-based mutations frequently involve donor plasmid integration at the target locus. Finally, we show that gap repair induced by two guide RNAs more reliably converts the intervening target sequence, whereas the use of Lig4169 mutants to suppress end joining does not improve recombination efficacy.

27540006	The ability to record molecular events in vivo would enable monitoring of signaling dynamics within cellular niches and critical factors that orchestrate cellular behavior. We present a self-contained analog memory device for longitudinal recording of molecular stimuli into DNA mutations in human cells. This device consists of a self-targeting guide RNA (stgRNA) that repeatedly directs Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 nuclease activity toward the DNA that encodes the stgRNA, enabling localized, continuous DNA mutagenesis as a function of stgRNA expression. We demonstrate programmable and multiplexed memory storage in human cells triggered by exogenous inducers or inflammation, both in vitro and in vivo. This tool, Mammalian Synthetic Cellular Recorder Integrating Biological Events (mSCRIBE), provides a distinct strategy for investigating cell biology in vivo and enables continuous evolution of targeted DNA sequences.

27539542	Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are broadly expressed in eukaryotic cells, but their molecular mechanism in human disease remains obscure. Here we show that circular antisense non-coding RNA in the INK4 locus (circANRIL), which is transcribed at a locus of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease on chromosome 9p21, confers atheroprotection by controlling ribosomal RNA (rRNA) maturation and modulating pathways of atherogenesis. CircANRIL binds to pescadillo homologue 1 (PES1), an essential 60S-preribosomal assembly factor, thereby impairing exonuclease-mediated pre-rRNA processing and ribosome biogenesis in vascular smooth muscle cells and macrophages. As a consequence, circANRIL induces nucleolar stress and p53 activation, resulting in the induction of apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation, which are key cell functions in atherosclerosis. Collectively, these findings identify circANRIL as a prototype of a circRNA regulating ribosome biogenesis and conferring atheroprotection, thereby showing that circularization of long non-coding RNAs may alter RNA function and protect from human disease.

27539336	A new method related to molecular biomarker with CRISPR/Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-cas) in Escherichia (E.) coli was developed and used for surveillance programs.	CRISPR/Cas sequence that containing 135 strains with complete sequence and 203 strains with whole genome shotgun sequence of E. coli in GenBank by BLAST and 361 strains of E. coli (including 38 strains of E. coli O157∶H7) in laboratory were identified by PCR and analyzed with the CRISPR Finder. Spacers were compared with DANMAN and the phylogenetic trees of cas gene were constructed under Clustal Ⅹ and Mega 5.1.	With new perspective, a descriptive method was developed targeting on the position of CRISPR/cas in E. coli. The CRISPR1 was detected in 77.04%, 100.00% and 75.62% and the CRISPR2 was detected in 74.81%, 100.00% and 92.24% and the CRISPR3 and CRISPR4 were detected in 11.85%, 0 and 1.39% for 135 strains with complete sequence, 203 strains with whole genome shotgun sequence and 361 strains in the laboratory, respectively. One strain downloaded in GenBank with whole genome sequencing and 2 strains in the our laboratory were identified that containing four CRISPR locus. The other E. coli strain was with insertion sequence in downstream of the non-cas CRISPR1. The unique CRISPR was found in 8 strains of O55∶H7, in 180 strains of O157∶H7, in 8 strains of O157∶HNM, in 40 strains of O104∶H4, in 4 strains of O145∶H28, in all the 699 E. coli strains. The phylogenetic tree could be divided into two groups-cas with type I-E or type I-F.	CRISPR/Cas might be used as a valuable molecular biomarker in epidemiological surveillance studies to identify the high virulent strains or new strains of E. coli.

27535623	Gene editing with all its own advantages in molecular biology applications has made easy manipulation of various production hosts with the discovery and implementation of modern gene editing tools such as Crispr (Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats), TALENs (Transcription activator-like effector nucleases) and ZFNs (Zinc finger nucleases). With the advent of these modern tools, it is now possible to manipulate the genome of industrial production hosts such as yeast and mammalian cells which allows developing a potential and cost effective recombinant therapeutic protein. These tools also allow single editing to multiple genes for knocking-in or knocking-out of a host genome quickly in an efficient manner. A recent study on "multiplexed" gene editing revolutionized the knock-out and knock-in events of yeast and CHO, mammalian cells genome for metabolic engineering as well as high, stable, and consistent expression of a transgene encoding complex therapeutic protein such as monoclonal antibody. The gene of interest can either be integrated or deleted at single or multiple loci depending on the strategy and production requirement. This review will give a gist of all the modern tools with a brief description and advances in genetic manipulation using three major tools being implemented for the modification of such hosts with the emphasis on the use of Crispr-Cas9 for the "multiplexing gene-editing approach" for genetic manipulation of yeast and CHO mammalian hosts that ultimately leads to a fast track product development with consistent, improved product yield, quality, and thus affordability for a population at large.

27533081	UTX is a histone demethylase gene located on the X chromosome and is a frequently mutated gene in urothelial bladder cancer (UBC). UTY is a paralog of UTX located on the Y chromosome. We performed target capture sequencing on 128 genes in 40 non-metastatic UBC patients. UTX was the most frequently mutated gene (30%, 12/40). Of the genetic alterations identified, 75% were truncating mutations. UTY copy number loss was detected in 8 male patients (22.8%, 8/35). Of the 9 male patients with UTX mutations, 6 also had copy number loss (66.7%). To evaluate the functional roles of UTX and UTY in tumor progression, we designed UTX and UTY single knockout and UTX-UTY double knockout experiments using a CRISPR/Cas9 lentiviral system, and compared the proliferative capacities of two UBC cell lines in vitro. Single UTX or UTY knockout increased cell proliferation as compared to UTX-UTY wild-type cells. UTX-UTY double knockout cells exhibited greater proliferation than single knockout cells. These findings suggest both UTX and UTY function as dose-dependent suppressors of UBC development. While UTX escapes X chromosome inactivation in females, UTY may function as a male homologue of UTX, which could compensate for dosage imbalances.

27533034	Viruses are the most abundant biological entities on Earth, but challenges in detecting, isolating, and classifying unknown viruses have prevented exhaustive surveys of the global virome. Here we analysed over 5 Tb of metagenomic sequence data from 3,042 geographically diverse samples to assess the global distribution, phylogenetic diversity, and host specificity of viruses. We discovered over 125,000 partial DNA viral genomes, including the largest phage yet identified, and increased the number of known viral genes by 16-fold. Half of the predicted partial viral genomes were clustered into genetically distinct groups, most of which included genes unrelated to those in known viruses. Using CRISPR spacers and transfer RNA matches to link viral groups to microbial host(s), we doubled the number of microbial phyla known to be infected by viruses, and identified viruses that can infect organisms from different phyla. Analysis of viral distribution across diverse ecosystems revealed strong habitat-type specificity for the vast majority of viruses, but also identified some cosmopolitan groups. Our results highlight an extensive global viral diversity and provide detailed insight into viral habitat distribution and host–virus interactions.

27532819	CRISPR/Cas9-gene editing has emerged as a revolutionary technology to easily modify specific genomic loci by designing complementary sgRNA sequences and introducing these into cells along with Cas9. Self-cloning CRISPR/Cas9 (scCRISPR) uses a self-cleaving palindromic sgRNA plasmid (sgPal) that recombines with short PCR-amplified site-specific sgRNA sequences within the target cell by homologous recombination to circumvent the process of sgRNA plasmid construction. Through this mechanism, scCRISPR enables gene editing within 2 hr once sgRNA oligos are available, with high efficiency equivalent to conventional sgRNA targeting: >90% gene knockout in both mouse and human embryonic stem cells and cancer cell lines. Furthermore, using PCR-based addition of short homology arms, we achieve efficient site-specific knock-in of transgenes such as GFP without traditional plasmid cloning or genome-integrated selection cassette (2% to 4% knock-in rate). The methods in this paper describe the most rapid and efficient means of CRISPR gene editing. © 2016 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.	M Arbab|RI Sherwood
27531614	IAA2 is a member of the Aux/IAA auxin responsive gene family in Arabidopsis thaliana. No iaa2 mutant has been reported until now, thus hindering its further mechanistic investigations. The normal genomic editing technology of CRISPR/Cas9 (Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9) uses only a single guide RNA (sgRNA) to target one site in a specific gene, and the gene knockout efficiency is not high. Instead, multiple sgRNAs can target multiple sites; therefore, the efficiency may be improved. In the present investigation, we used the golden-gate cloning strategy and two rounds of PCR reactions to combine three sgRNAs in the same entry vector. The final expression vector was obtained by LR reactions with the destination vector containing the Cas9 expression cassette. Four out of the six sgRNAs were effective, and we also obtained a lot of insertion and deletion mutations. Compared with one sgRNA approach, multiple sgRNAs displayed higher gene-knockout efficiency and produced more germ-line mutants. Thus, we established a more rapid and efficient method and generated five mutants for further studies of IAA2 functions.	DY Liu|T Qiu|XH Ding|M Li|MY Zhu|JH Wang
27531613	The transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALEN) and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) systems are two current genome editing technologies. Here, we compare and analyze the characteristics of the targeted mutations mediated by these two systems, such as efficiency, type, position, time, and genetic patterns. Both the TALEN and CRISPR/Cas9 systems can induce site-specific mutations in T0 rice plants effectively, but CRISPR/Cas9 is more effective. The major mutation type in both systems is the short insertion/deletion(InDel) mutation within 10 base pairs: deletions ranging from 1 to 10 bps are more often in TALEN, and 1bp insertions are more often in CRISPR/Cas9. Moreover, double-strand breaks (DSBs) generated by CRISPR/Cas9 are more precise than TALEN. In addition, DSBs could be repaired by the homologous recombination at a low frequency, causing DNA fragment duplication mutations. In some cases, the DNA fragments between the two close targets are deleted or inverted, and the mutation efficiency does not positively correlatewith the mutation efficiency of each target. Mutagenesis mediated by the TALEN or CRISPR/Cas9 system can occur as early as in transformed callus cells, and less frequently in somatic cells. Consequently, four different mutation types are formed, including homozygous, heterozygous, bi-allelic and chimeric mutations, with bi-allelic mutations having the highest rate and chimeric mutations having the lowest rate. All, except chimeric mutations, can descend stably into the next generation.	L Tang|YK Li|D Zhang|BG Mao|QM Lv|YY Hu|Y Shao|Y Peng|BR Zhao|ST Xia
27531594	Analysis of the genome of Klebsiella pneumoniae NTUH-K2044 strain revealed the presence of two clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) arrays separated with CRISPR-associated (cas) genes. Carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates were observed to be less likely to have CRISPR-Cas than sensitive strains (5/85 vs. 22/132). Removal of the transcriptional repressor, H-NS, was shown to prevent the transformation of plasmids carrying a spacer and putative proto-spacer adjacent motif (PAM). The CRISPR-Cas system also decreased pUC-4K plasmid stability, resulting in plasmid loss from the bacteria with acquisition of new spacers. Analysis of the acquired proto-spacers in pUC-4K indicated that 5'-TTN-3' was the preferred PAM in K. pneumoniae. Treatment of cells by imipenem induced hns expression, thereby decreasing cas3 expression and consequently repressed CRISPR-Cas activity resulted in increase of plasmid stability. In conclusion, NTUH-K2044 CRISPR-Cas contributes to decrease of plasmid transformation and stability. Through repression of CRISPR-Cas activity by induced H-NS, bacteria might be more able to acquire DNA to confront the challenge of imipenem.	TL Lin|YJ Pan|PF Hsieh|CR Hsu|MC Wu|JT Wang
27530680	PCR-mediated chromosome splitting (PCS) was developed in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It is based on homologous recombination and enables division of a chromosome at any point to form two derived and functional chromosomes. However, because of low homologous recombination activity, PCS is limited to a single site at a time, which makes the splitting of multiple loci laborious and time-consuming. Here we have developed a highly efficient and versatile chromosome engineering technology named CRISPR-PCS that integrates PCS with the novel genome editing CRISPR/Cas9 system. This integration allows PCS to utilize induced double strand breaks to activate homologous recombination. CRISPR-PCS enhances the efficiency of chromosome splitting approximately 200-fold and enables generation of simultaneous multiple chromosome splits. We propose that CRISPR-PCS will be a powerful tool for breeding novel yeast strains with desirable traits for specific industrial applications and for investigating genome function.

27528385	The CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing method is comprised of the guide RNA (gRNA) to target a specific DNA sequence for cleavage and the Cas9 endonuclease for introducing breaks in the double-stranded DNA identified by the gRNA. Co-expression of both a multiplex of HIV-1-specific gRNAs and Cas9 in cells results in the modification and/or excision of the segment of viral DNA, leading to replication-defective virus. In this study, we have personalized the activity of CRISPR/Cas9 by placing the gene encoding Cas9 under the control of a minimal promoter of HIV-1 that is activated by the HIV-1 Tat protein. We demonstrate that functional activation of CRISPR/Cas9 by Tat during the course of viral infection excises the designated segment of the integrated viral DNA and consequently suppresses viral expression. This strategy was also used in a latently infected CD4+ T-cell model after treatment with a variety of HIV-1 stimulating agents including PMA and TSA. Controlled expression of Cas9 by Tat offers a new strategy for safe implementation of the Cas9 technology for ablation of HIV-1 at a very early stage of HIV-1 replication during the course of the acute phase of infection and the reactivation of silent proviral DNA in latently infected cells.

27523609	Telomerase maintains genome integrity by adding repetitive DNA sequences to the chromosome ends in actively dividing cells, including 90% of all cancer cells. Recruitment of human telomerase to telomeres occurs during S-phase of the cell cycle, but the molecular mechanism of the process is only partially understood. Here, we use CRISPR genome editing and single-molecule imaging to track telomerase trafficking in nuclei of living human cells. We demonstrate that telomerase uses three-dimensional diffusion to search for telomeres, probing each telomere thousands of times each S-phase but only rarely forming a stable association. Both the transient and stable association events depend on the direct interaction of the telomerase protein TERT with the telomeric protein TPP1. Our results reveal that telomerase recruitment to telomeres is driven by dynamic interactions between the rapidly diffusing telomerase and the chromosome end.	JC Schmidt|AJ Zaug|TR Cech

27521267	NK cell education, a term describing a process for NK cell acquisition of functional competence, is primarily achieved by self-MHC-I-specific inhibitory receptors. In this study, we have demonstrated that SLAM family receptors (SFRs) redundantly expressed on hematopoietic cells function as self-specific activation receptors critical for NK cell education. To overcome gene redundancy, we generated mice simultaneously lacking seven SFRs, revealing that NK-cell-mediated rejection of semi-allogeneic hematopoietic cells largely depended on the presence of SFRs on target cells. This stimulatory effect was determined by the presence of SFR-coupled adaptors; however, SFR-deficient mice displayed enhanced reactivity to hematopoietic cells. These findings demonstrate that SFRs endow NK cells with an ability to kill hematopoietic cells during the effector phase; however, the sustained engagement of SFRs can desensitize NK cell responses during an education process. Therefore, self-specific activating ligands may be "tolerogens" for NK cells, akin to self-antigens that induce T cell tolerance.	S Chen|M Yang|J Du|D Li|Z Li|C Cai|Y Ma|L Zhang|Z Tian|Z Dong
27517504	In this review, I will summarize recent developments in the use of the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated 9 (Cas9) genome editing system for cell transplant applications, ranging from transplantation of corrected autologous patient stem cells to treat inherited diseases, to the tailoring of donor pigs for cell xenotransplantation. Rational engineering of the Cas9 nuclease to improve its specificity will also be discussed.	Over the past year, CRISPR/Cas9 has been used in preclinical studies to correct mutations in a rapidly increasing spectrum of diseases including hematological, neuromuscular, and respiratory disorders. The growing popularity of CRISPR/Cas9 over earlier genome editing platforms is partly due to its ease of use and flexibility, which is evident from the success of complex manipulations such as specific deletion of up to 725 kb in patient-derived stem cells, and simultaneous disruption of up to 62 endogenous retrovirus loci in pig cells. In addition, high-fidelity variants of Cas9 with greatly increased specificity are now available.	CRISPR/Cas9 is a fast-evolving technology that is likely to have a significant impact on autologous, allogeneic, and xenogeneic cell transplantation.	PJ Cowan
27517496	Numerous mutations of the Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene have been reported to cause dysfunction of VHL protein (pVHL) and lead to processes related to tumor progression. pVHL acts as an E3 ligase and degrades downstream targets, such as hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (HIF) which is essential for tumor growth. Previous studies reported reduction of VHL protein, rather than mRNA in VHL-related tumor patients, suggesting that instability of the pVHL protein itself is a primary cause of dysfunction. Regulation of pVHL stability has therefore been a major focus of research. We report that ubiquitin-specific protease 9X (USP9X), which is a deubiquitinase binds and promotes degradation of both wild-type and mutants of pVHL that retain E3 ligase function, thus activating the HIF pathway. USP9X degrades pVHL through protection of its substrate, the newly identified pVHL E3 ligase Smurf1. In addition, USP9X activates glycolysis and promotes cell proliferation through pVHL. Treatment with a USP9X inhibitor shows an effect similar to USP9X knockdown in pVHL induction, and suppresses HIF activity. Our findings demonstrate that USP9X is a novel regulator of pVHL stability, and USP9X may be a therapeutic target for treatment of VHL-related tumors.

27515683	CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing strategy has been applied to a variety of species and the tRNA-processing system has been used to compact multiple gRNAs into one synthetic gene for manipulating multiple genes in rice.	We optimized and introduced the multiplex gene editing strategy based on the tRNA-processing system into maize. Maize glycine-tRNA was selected to design multiple tRNA-gRNA units for the simultaneous production of numerous gRNAs under the control of one maize U6 promoter. We designed three gRNAs for simplex editing and three multiple tRNA-gRNA units for multiplex editing. The results indicate that this system not only increased the number of targeted sites but also enhanced mutagenesis efficiency in maize. Additionally, we propose an advanced sequence selection of gRNA spacers for relatively more efficient and accurate chromosomal fragment deletion, which is important for complete abolishment of gene function especially long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Our results also indicated that up to four tRNA-gRNA units in one expression cassette design can still work in maize.	The examples reported here demonstrate the utility of the tRNA-processing system-based strategy as an efficient multiplex genome editing tool to enhance maize genetic research and breeding.

27515175	The Black and Tan Brachyury (BTBR) mouse strain is a valuable model for the study of long-term complications from obesity-induced type 2 diabetes mellitus and autism spectrum disorder. Due to technical difficulties with assisted reproduction, genetically modified animals on this background have previously been generated through extensive backcrossing, which is expensive and time-consuming. We successfully generated two separate transgenic mouse lines after direct zygote microinjection into this background strain. Additionally, we developed in vitro fertilization (IVF) methods for the BTBR mouse. We found low rates of fertilization and implantation in this strain, and identified the BTBR oocyte as the primary culprit of low success with BTBR IVF. We achieved an increase in live born pups from 5.9 to 35.6 % with IVF in the BTBR strain by use of BTBR females at a younger age (18-25 days), collection of oocytes 15-17 h after superovulation, and the use of supplemented fertilization media. This method eliminates the need for time consuming assisted embryo manipulations that are otherwise required for success with BTBR oocytes. This advancement provides an exciting opportunity to directly generate BTBR transgenics and gene-edited mice using both traditional and emerging genomic editing techniques, such as CRISPR/Cas9. These methods also allow effective colony preservation and rederivation with these strains. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing embryo manipulations in BTBR mice.

27510362	CRISPR/Cas9 is a powerful genome editing tool in many organisms, including a number of monocots and dicots. Although the design and application of CRISPR/Cas9 is simpler compared to other nuclease-based genome editing tools, optimization requires the consideration of the DNA delivery and tissue regeneration methods for a particular species to achieve accuracy and efficiency. Here, we describe a public sector system, ISU Maize CRISPR, utilizing Agrobacterium-delivered CRISPR/Cas9 for high-frequency targeted mutagenesis in maize. This system consists of an Escherichia coli cloning vector and an Agrobacterium binary vector. It can be used to clone up to four guide RNAs for single or multiplex gene targeting. We evaluated this system for its mutagenesis frequency and heritability using four maize genes in two duplicated pairs: Argonaute 18 (ZmAgo18a and ZmAgo18b) and dihydroflavonol 4-reductase or anthocyaninless genes (a1 and a4). T0 transgenic events carrying mono- or diallelic mutations of one locus and various combinations of allelic mutations of two loci occurred at rates over 70% mutants per transgenic events in both Hi-II and B104 genotypes. Through genetic segregation, null segregants carrying only the desired mutant alleles without the CRISPR transgene could be generated in T1 progeny. Inheritance of an active CRISPR/Cas9 transgene leads to additional target-specific mutations in subsequent generations. Duplex infection of immature embryos by mixing two individual Agrobacterium strains harbouring different Cas9/gRNA modules can be performed for improved cost efficiency. Together, the findings demonstrate that the ISU Maize CRISPR platform is an effective and robust tool to targeted mutagenesis in maize.

27507792	CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats)-mediated RNA degradation is catalyzed by a type III system in the hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus Earlier work demonstrated that the system can be engineered to target specifically mRNA of an endogenous host reporter gene, namely the β-galactosidase in S. solfataricus Here, we investigated the effect of single and multiple spacers targeting the mRNA of a second reporter gene, α-amylase, at the same, and at different, locations respectively, using a minimal CRISPR (miniCR) locus supplied on a viral shuttle vector. The use of increasing numbers of spacers reduced mRNA levels at progressively higher levels, with three crRNAs (CRISPR RNAs) leading to ∼ 70-80% reduction, and five spacers resulting in an α-amylase gene knockdown of > 90% measured on both mRNA and protein activity levels. Our results indicate that this technology can be used to increase or modulate gene knockdown for efficient post-transcriptional gene silencing in hyperthermophilic archaea, and potentially also in other organisms.

27498870	Bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) family inhibitors offer an approach to treating hematological malignancies. We used precision nuclear run-on transcription sequencing (PRO-seq) to create high-resolution maps of active RNA polymerases across the genome in t(8;21) acute myeloid leukemia (AML), as these polymerases are exceptionally sensitive to BET inhibitors. PRO-seq identified over 1,400 genes showing impaired release of promoter-proximal paused RNA polymerases, including the stem cell factor receptor tyrosine kinase KIT that is mutated in t(8;21) AML. PRO-seq also identified an enhancer 3' to KIT. Chromosome conformation capture confirmed contacts between this enhancer and the KIT promoter, while CRISPRi-mediated repression of this enhancer impaired cell growth. PRO-seq also identified microRNAs, including MIR29C and MIR29B2, that target the anti-apoptotic factor MCL1 and were repressed by BET inhibitors. MCL1 protein was upregulated, and inhibition of BET proteins sensitized t(8:21)-containing cells to MCL1 inhibition, suggesting a potential mechanism of resistance to BET-inhibitor-induced cell death.

27497066	In the past few years, extensive progress has been made in the development of genome-editing technology. Among several genome-editing tools, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindrome repeat-associated Cas9 nuclease (CRISPR/Cas9) system is particularly widely used owing to the ease of sequence-specific nuclease construction and the highly efficient introduction of mutations. The CRISPR/Cas9 system was originally constructed to induce small insertion and deletion mutations, but various methods have been developed to introduce point mutations, deletions, insertions, chromosomal translocations and so on. These methods should be useful for the reconstruction of disease-causing mutations in cultured cell lines and living organisms to elucidate disease pathogenesis and for disease prevention, treatment and drug discovery. This review summarizes the current technical aspects of the CRISPR/Cas9 system for disease modeling in cultured cells and living organisms, mainly mice.	T Kato|S Takada
27496775	The discovery and exploitation of the prokaryotic adaptive immunity system based on clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins have revolutionized genetic engineering. CRISPR-Cas tools have enabled extensive genome editing as well as efficient modulation of the transcriptional program in a multitude of organisms. Progress in the development of genetic engineering tools for the genus Clostridium has lagged behind that of many other prokaryotes, presenting the CRISPR-Cas technology an opportunity to resolve a long-existing issue. Here, we applied the Streptococcus pyogenes type II CRISPR-Cas9 (SpCRISPR-Cas9) system for genome editing in Clostridium acetobutylicum DSM792. We further explored the utility of the SpCRISPR-Cas9 machinery for gene-specific transcriptional repression. For proof-of-concept demonstration, a plasmid-encoded fluorescent protein gene was used for transcriptional repression in C. acetobutylicum Subsequently, we targeted the carbon catabolite repression (CCR) system of C. acetobutylicum through transcriptional repression of the hprK gene encoding HPr kinase/phosphorylase, leading to the coutilization of glucose and xylose, which are two abundant carbon sources from lignocellulosic feedstocks. Similar approaches based on SpCRISPR-Cas9 for genome editing and transcriptional repression were also demonstrated in Clostridium pasteurianum ATCC 6013. As such, this work lays a foundation for the derivation of clostridial strains for industrial purposes.	After recognizing the industrial potential of Clostridium for decades, methods for the genetic manipulation of these anaerobic bacteria are still underdeveloped. This study reports the implementation of CRISPR-Cas technology for genome editing and transcriptional regulation in Clostridium acetobutylicum, which is arguably the most common industrial clostridial strain. The developed genetic tools enable simpler, more reliable, and more extensive derivation of C. acetobutylicum mutant strains for industrial purposes. Similar approaches were also demonstrated in Clostridium pasteurianum, another clostridial strain that is capable of utilizing glycerol as the carbon source for butanol fermentation, and therefore can be arguably applied in other clostridial strains.

27496731	Detection of intracellular DNA triggers activation of the STING-dependent interferon-stimulatory DNA (ISD) pathway, which is essential for antiviral responses. Multiple DNA sensors have been proposed to activate this pathway, including AIM2-like receptors (ALRs). Whether the ALRs are essential for activation of this pathway remains unknown. To rigorously explore the function of ALRs, we generated mice lacking all 13 ALR genes. We found that ALRs are dispensable for the type I interferon (IFN) response to transfected DNA ligands, DNA virus infection, and lentivirus infection. We also found that ALRs do not contribute to autoimmune disease in the Trex1(-/-) mouse model of Aicardi-Goutières Syndrome. Finally, CRISPR-mediated disruption of the human AIM2-like receptor IFI16 in primary fibroblasts revealed that IFI16 is not essential for the IFN response to human cytomegalovirus infection. Our findings indicate that ALRs are dispensable for the ISD response and suggest that alternative functions for these receptors should be explored.

27494556	Intratumor heterogeneity is thought to be the driving force of tumor evolution and therapy resistance. Yet tools to study these processes are limited. In this issue, Guernet et al.

27492621	The transport of secretory proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi depends on COPII-coated vesicles. While the basic principles of the COPII machinery have been identified, it remains largely unknown how COPII transport is regulated to accommodate tissue- or activation-specific differences in cargo load and identity. Here we show that activation-induced alternative splicing of Sec16 controls adaptation of COPII transport to increased secretory cargo upon T-cell activation. Using splice-site blocking morpholinos and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome engineering, we show that the number of ER exit sites, COPII dynamics and transport efficiency depend on Sec16 alternative splicing. As the mechanistic basis, we suggest the C-terminal Sec16 domain to be a splicing-controlled protein interaction platform, with individual isoforms showing differential abilities to recruit COPII components. Our work connects the COPII pathway with alternative splicing, adding a new regulatory layer to protein secretion and its adaptation to changing cellular environments.

27492474	The generation of genetic variation (somatic hypermutation) is an essential process for the adaptive immune system in vertebrates. We demonstrate the targeted single-nucleotide substitution of DNA using hybrid vertebrate and bacterial immune systems components. Nuclease-deficient type II CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated) and the activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) ortholog PmCDA1 were engineered to form a synthetic complex (Target-AID) that performs highly efficient target-specific mutagenesis. Specific point mutation was induced primarily at cytidines within the target range of five bases. The toxicity associated with the nuclease-based CRISPR/Cas9 system was greatly reduced. Although combination of nickase Cas9(D10A) and the deaminase was highly effective in yeasts, it also induced insertion and deletion (indel) in mammalian cells. Use of uracil DNA glycosylase inhibitor suppressed the indel formation and improved the efficiency.

27491876	The CRISPR/Cas9 system has become a regularly used tool for editing the genome of many model organisms at specific sites. However, two limiting steps arise in the process of validating guide RNA target sites in larvae and adults: the time required to identify indels and the cost associated with identifying potential mutant animals.	Here we have combined and optimized the HotSHOT genomic DNA extraction technique with a two-steps Evagreen PCR, followed by a high-resolution melting (HRM) assay, which facilitates rapid identification of CRISPR-induced indels. With this technique, we were able to genotype adult zebrafish using genomic DNA extracted from fin-clips in less than 2 h. We were also able to obtain a reliable and early read-out of the effectiveness of guide RNAs only 4 h after the embryos were injected with the constructs for the CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenic system. Furthermore, through mutagenesis kinetic assay, we identified that the 2-cell stage is the earliest time point at which indels can be observed.	By combining an inexpensive and rapid genomic DNA extraction method with an HRM-based assay, our approach allows for high-throughput genotyping of adult zebrafish and embryos, and is more sensitive than standard PCR approaches, permitting early identification of CRISPR-induced indels and with applications for other model organisms as well.

27488074	Despite ever-increasing understanding of the genetic underpinnings of many corneal dystrophies, gene therapy designed to ameliorate disease has not yet been reported in any human patient. In this review, we explore the likely reasons for this apparent failure of translation. We identify the requirements for success: the genetic defect involved must have been identified and mapped, vision in the affected patient must be significantly impaired or likely to be impaired, no better or equivalently effective treatment must be available, the treatment must be capable of modulating corneal pathology, and delivery of the construct to the appropriate cell must be practicable. We consider which of the corneal dystrophies might be amenable to treatment by genetic manipulations, summarize existing therapeutic options for treatment, and explore gene editing using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat/Cas and other similar transformative technologies as the way of the future. We then summarize recent laboratory-based advances in gene delivery and the development of in vitro and in vivo models of the corneal dystrophies. Finally, we review recent experimental work that has increased our knowledge of the pathobiology of these conditions.	KA Williams|YD Irani
27488072	Ophthalmic researchers and clinicians arguably have led the way for safe, effective gene therapy, most notably with adeno-associated viral gene supplementation in the treatment for patients with Leber congenital amaurosis type 2 with mutations in the RPE65 gene. These successes notwithstanding, most other genetic retinal disease will be refractory to supplementation. The ideal gene therapy approach would correct gene mutations to restore normal function in the affected cells. Gene editing in which a mutant allele is inactivated or converted to sequence that restores normal function is hypothetically one such approach. Such editing involves site-specific digestion of mutant genomic DNA followed by repair. Previous experimental approaches were hampered by inaccurate and high rates of off-site lesioning and by overall low digestion rates. A new tool, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats coupled with the nuclease Cas9, may address both shortcomings. Some of the many challenges that must be addressed in moving clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats coupled with the nuclease Cas9 therapies to the ophthalmic clinic are discussed here.

27487802	In previous studies, Lactobacillus plantarum ZJ316 showed probiotic properties, such as antimicrobial activity against various pathogens and the capacity to significantly improve pig growth and pork quality. The purpose of this study was to reveal the genes potentially related to its genetic adaptation and probiotic profiles based on comparative genomic analysis.	The genome sequence of L. plantarum ZJ316 was compared with those of eight L. plantarum strains deposited in GenBank. BLASTN, Mauve, and MUMmer programs were used for genome alignment and comparison. CRISPRFinder was applied for searching the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs).	We identified genes that encode proteins related to genetic adaptation and probiotic profiles, including carbohydrate transport and metabolism, proteolytic enzyme systems and amino acid biosynthesis, CRISPR adaptive immunity, stress responses, bile salt resistance, ability to adhere to the host intestinal wall, exopolysaccharide (EPS) biosynthesis, and bacteriocin biosynthesis.	Comparative characterization of the L. plantarum ZJ316 genome provided the genetic basis for further elucidating the functional mechanisms of its probiotic properties. ZJ316 could be considered a potential probiotic candidate.	P Li|X Li|Q Gu|XY Lou|XM Zhang|DF Song|C Zhang

27483988	Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) have great therapeutic potential because of their ability to both self-renew and differentiate. It has been proposed that, given their unique properties, a small number of genetically modified HSPCs could accomplish lifelong, corrective reconstitution of the entire hematopoietic system in patients with various hematologic disorders. Scientists have demonstrated that gene addition therapies-targeted to HSPCs and using integrating retroviral vectors-possess clear clinical benefits in multiple diseases, among them immunodeficiencies, storage disorders, and hemoglobinopathies. Scientists attempting to develop clinically relevant gene therapy protocols have, however, encountered a number of unexpected hurdles because of their incomplete knowledge of target cells, genomic control, and gene transfer technologies. Targeted gene-editing technologies using engineered nucleases such as ZFN, TALEN, and/or CRISPR/Cas9 RGEN show great clinical promise, allowing for the site-specific correction of disease-causing mutations-a process with important applications in autosomal dominant or dominant-negative genetic disorders. The relative simplicity of the CRISPR/Cas9 system, in particular, has sparked an exponential increase in the scientific community's interest in and use of these gene-editing technologies. In this minireview, we discuss the specific applications of gene-editing technologies in human HSPCs, as informed by prior experience with gene addition strategies. HSPCs are desirable but challenging targets; the specific mechanisms these cells evolved to protect themselves from DNA damage render them potentially more susceptible to oncogenesis, especially given their ability to self-renew and their long-term proliferative potential. We further review scientists' experience with gene-editing technologies to date, focusing on strategies to move these techniques toward implementation in safe and effective clinical trials.

27474397	The CRISPR/Cas9 system is a powerful tool for elucidating the roles of genes in a wide variety of organisms including mice. To obtain genetically modified embryos or mice by this method, Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA are usually introduced into zygotes by microinjection or electroporation. However, most mutants generated with this method are genetically mosaic, composed of several types of cells carrying different mutations, which complicates phenotype analysis in founder embryos or mice. To simplify the analysis and to elucidate the roles of genes involved in developmental processes, a method for producing non-mosaic mutants is needed. Here, we established a method for generating non-mosaic mouse mutant embryos. We introduced Cas9 protein and sgRNA into in vitro fertilized (IVF) zygotes by electroporation, which enabled the genome editing to occur before the first replication of the mouse genome. As a result, all of the cells in the mutant carried the same set of mutations. This method solves the problem of mosaicism/allele complexity in founder mutant embryos or mice generated by the CRIPSR/Cas9 system.	M Hashimoto|Y Yamashita|T Takemoto
27466818	SESN3 has been implicated in multiple biological processes including protection against oxidative stress, regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism. However, little is known about the factors and mechanisms controlling its gene expression at the transcriptional level. We performed in silico phylogenetic footprinting analysis of 5 kb upstream regions of a diverse set of human SESN3 orthologs for the identification of high confidence conserved binding motifs (BMo). We further analyzed the predicted BMo by a motif comparison tool to identify the TFs likely to bind these discovered motifs. Predicted TFs were then integrated with experimentally known protein-protein interactions and experimentally validated to delineate the important transcriptional regulators of SESN3. Our study revealed high confidence set of BMos (integrated with DNase I hypersensitivity sites) in the upstream regulatory regions of SESN3 that could be bound by transcription factors from multiple families including FOXOs, SMADs, SOXs, TCFs and HNF4A. TF-TF network analysis established hubs of interaction that include SMAD3, TCF3, SMAD2, HDAC2, SOX2, TAL1 and TCF12 as well as the likely protein complexes formed between them. We show using ChIP-PCR as well as over-expression and knock out studies that FOXO3 and SOX2 transcriptionally regulate the expression of SESN3 gene. Our findings provide an important roadmap to further our understanding on the regulation of SESN3.	R Srivastava|Y Zhang|X Xiong|X Zhang|X Pan|XC Dong|S Liangpunsakul|SC Janga
27464801	Using TALEN or CRISPR/Cas system to induce small indels into coding sequences has been implicated in broad applications for reverse genetic studies of many organisms including zebrafish. However, complete deletion of a large gene or noncoding gene(s) or removing a large genomic fragment spanning several genes or other chromosomal elements is preferred in various cases, as well as inducing chromosomal inversions. Here, we describe the detailed protocols for the generation of chromosomal deletion mutations mediated by Cas9 and a pair of gRNAs and the evaluation for the efficiencies in F0 founder fish and of germline transmission.

27464800	The recent remarkable innovation of an RNA-guided nuclease system, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) system, enables us the modification of specific genomic loci in various model animals including zebrafish. With this system, multiple guide RNAs simultaneously injected with the Cas9 nuclease into zebrafish embryos cause multiple genome modifications at different genomic loci with high efficiency; therefore, a simple method to detect individual mutations at distinct loci is desired. In this chapter, we describe a procedure for inducing multiple CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome modifications in zebrafish and a convenient method to detect CRISPR/Cas9-induced insertion and/or deletion (indel) mutations using a heteroduplex mobility assay (HMA).

27464799	Targeting nucleases like zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated (CRISPR/Cas) system have revolutionized genome-editing possibilities in many model organisms. They allow the generation of loss-of-function alleles by the introduction of double-strand breaks at defined sites within genes, but also more sophisticated genome-editing approaches have become possible. These include the integration of donor plasmid DNA into the genome by homology-independent repair mechanisms after CRISPR/Cas9-mediated cleavage. Here we present a protocol outlining the most important steps to target a genomic site and to integrate a donor plasmid at this defined locus.	TO Auer|F Del Bene
27461509	Elizabethkingia anophelis is an emerging pathogen involved in human infections and outbreaks in distinct world regions. We investigated the phylogenetic relationships and pathogenesis-associated genomic features of two neonatal meningitis isolates isolated 5 years apart from one hospital in Central African Republic and compared them with Elizabethkingia from other regions and sources. Average nucleotide identity firmly confirmed that E. anophelis, E. meningoseptica and E. miricola represent demarcated genomic species. A core genome multilocus sequence typing scheme, broadly applicable to Elizabethkingia species, was developed and made publicly available (http://bigsdb.pasteur.fr/elizabethkingia). Phylogenetic analysis revealed distinct E. anophelis sublineages and demonstrated high genetic relatedness between the African isolates, compatible with persistence of the strain in the hospital environment. CRISPR spacer variation between the African isolates was mirrored by the presence of a large mobile genetic element. The pan-genome of E. anophelis comprised 6,880 gene families, underlining genomic heterogeneity of this species. African isolates carried unique resistance genes acquired by horizontal transfer. We demonstrated the presence of extensive variation of the capsular polysaccharide synthesis gene cluster in E. anophelis. Our results demonstrate the dynamic evolution of this emerging pathogen and the power of genomic approaches for Elizabethkingia identification, population biology and epidemiology.

27459410	There are thousands of chemicals used by humans and detected in the environment for which limited or no toxicological data are available. Rapid and cost-effective approaches for assessing the toxicological properties of chemicals are needed. We used CRISPR-Cas9 functional genomic screening to identify the potential molecular mechanism of a widely used antimicrobial triclosan (TCS) in HepG2 cells. Resistant genes at IC50 (the concentration causing a 50% reduction in cell viability) were significantly enriched in the adherens junction pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, and PPAR signaling pathway, suggesting a potential role in the molecular mechanism of TCS-induced cytotoxicity. Evaluation of the top-ranked resistant genes, FTO (encoding an mRNA demethylase) and MAP2K3 (a MAP kinase kinase family gene), revealed that their loss conferred resistance to TCS. In contrast, sensitive genes at IC10 and IC20 were specifically enriched in pathways involved with immune responses, which was concordant with transcriptomic profiling of TCS at concentrations of <IC10. It is suggested that the CRISPR-Cas9 fingerprint may reveal the patterns of TCS toxicity at low concentration levels. Moreover, we retrieved the potential connection between CRISPR-Cas9 fingerprint and disease terms, obesity, and breast cancer from an existing chemical-gene-disease database. Overall, CRISPR-Cas9 functional genomic screening offers an alternative approach for chemical toxicity testing.	P Xia|X Zhang|Y Xie|M Guan|DL Villeneuve|H Yu
27458917	Bacterial CRISPR-Cas systems acquire short sequences, called spacers, from viruses and plasmids, leading to adaptive immunity.

27457023	The BubR1/Bub3 complex is an important regulator of chromosome segregation as it facilitates proper kinetochore-microtubule interactions and is also an essential component of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). Whether BubR1/Bub3 localization to kinetochores in human cells stimulates SAC signalling or only contributes to kinetochore-microtubule interactions is debated. Here we show that two distinct pools of BubR1/Bub3 exist at kinetochores and we uncouple these with defined BubR1/Bub3 mutants to address their function. The major kinetochore pool of BubR1/Bub3 is dependent on direct Bub1/Bub3 binding and is required for chromosome alignment but not for the SAC. A distinct pool of BubR1/Bub3 localizes by directly binding to phosphorylated MELT repeats on the outer kinetochore protein KNL1. When we prevent the direct binding of BubR1/Bub3 to KNL1 the checkpoint is weakened because BubR1/Bub3 is not incorporated into checkpoint complexes efficiently. In conclusion, kinetochore localization supports both known functions of BubR1/Bub3.	G Zhang|BL Mendez|GG Sedgwick|J Nilsson
27455021	The CRISPR-Cas9 system is a new targeted nuclease for genome editing, which can directly introduce modifications at the targeted genomic locus. The system utilizes a short single guide RNA (sgRNA) to direct the endonuclease Cas9 in the genome. Upon targeting, Cas9 can generate DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). As such DSBs are repaired by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology directed repair (HDR), therefore facilitates introduction of random or specific mutations, repair of endogenous mutations, or insertion of DNA elements. The system has been successfully used to generate gene targeted cell lines including those of human, animals and plants. This article reviews recent advances made in this rapidly evolving technique for the generation of animal models for human diseases.	Z Ou|X Sun
29019208	The clustered regulatory interspaced short palindromic repeat-Cas9 (CRISPR-Cas9) system is the part of the prokaryotic immune system, which could recognize and delete the exogenous sequences originated from virus or plasmid. Based on its mechanism, CRISPR-Cas9 system was developed into the new generation of gene editing tool. Compared to the existed technologies such as ES targeting, ZFN or TALEN, CRISPR-Cas9 system is a more efficient, economical and promising approach to manipulate the genome. In this review, we summarize the research progress about CRISPR-Cas9 technology, especially the latest applications in gene therapy studies of human diseases.

27430306	Cas9 endonuclease, from so-called clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) systems of Streptococcus pyogenes, type II functions as an RNA-guided endonuclease and edits the genomes of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, including deletion and insertion by DNA double‑stranded break repair mechanisms. In previous studies, it was observed that Cas9, with a genome‑scale lentiviral single‑guide RNA library, could be applied to a loss‑of‑function genetic screen, although the loss‑of‑function genes have yet to be verified in vitro and this approach has not been used in porcine cells. Based on these observations, lentiviral Cas9 was used to infect porcine primary fibroblasts to achieve cell colonies carrying Cas9 endonuclease. Subsequently, porcine fetal fibroblasts expressing the tetracycline‑inducible Cas9 gene were generated by somatic cell nuclear transfer, and three 30 day transgenic porcine fetal fibroblasts (PFFs) were obtained. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), reverse transcription‑PCR and western blot analysis indicated that the PFFs were Cas9‑positive. In addition, one of the three integrations was located near to known functional genes in the PFF1 cell line, whereas neither of the integrations was located in the PFF1 or PFF2 cell lines. It was hypothesized that these transgenic PFFs may be useful for conditional genomic editing in pigs, and for generating ideal modified porcine models.	G Liu|K Liu|H Wei|L Li|S Zhang
27422784	Dual-agonist molecules combining glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) activity represent an exciting therapeutic strategy for diabetes treatment. Although challenging due to shared downstream signalling pathways, determining the relative activity of dual agonists at each receptor is essential when developing potential novel therapeutics. The challenge is exacerbated in physiologically relevant cell systems expressing both receptors. To this end, either GIP receptors (GIPR) or GLP-1 receptors (GLP-1R) were ablated via RNA-guided clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9 endonucleases in the INS-1 pancreatic β-cell line. Multiple clonal cell lines harbouring gene disruptions for each receptor were isolated and assayed for receptor activity to identify functional knockouts (KOs). cAMP production in response to GIPR or GLP-1R activation was abolished and GIP- or GLP-1-induced potentiation of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) was attenuated in the cognate KO cell lines. The contributions of individual receptors derived from cAMP and GSIS assays were confirmed in vivo using GLP-1R KO mice in combination with a monoclonal antibody antagonist of GIPR. We have successfully applied CRISPR/Cas9-engineered cell lines to determining selectivity and relative potency contributions of dual-agonist molecules targeting receptors with overlapping native expression profiles and downstream signalling pathways. Specifically, we have characterised molecules as biased towards GIPR or GLP-1R, or with relatively balanced potency in a physiologically relevant β-cell system. This demonstrates the broad utility of CRISPR/Cas9 when applied to native expression systems for the development of drugs that target multiple receptors, particularly where the balance of receptor activity is critical.

27418421	CRISPR-based genome editing has been widely implemented in various cell types. In silico single guide RNA (sgRNA) design is a key step for successful gene editing using the CRISPR system, and continuing efforts are aimed at refining in silico sgRNA design with high on-target efficacy and reduced off-target effects. Many sgRNA design tools are available, but careful assessments of their application scenarios and performance benchmarks across different types of genome-editing data are needed. Efficient in silico models can be built that integrate current heterogeneous genome-editing data to derive unbiased sgRNA design rules and identify key features for improving sgRNA design. Comprehensive evaluation of on-target and off-target effects of sgRNA will allow more precise genome editing and gene therapies using the CRISPR system.	GH Chuai|QL Wang|Q Liu
27417933	Next-generation sequencing technologies have rapidly expanded the genomic information of numerous organisms and revealed a rich reservoir of natural product gene clusters from microbial genomes, especially from Streptomyces, the largest genus of known actinobacteria at present. However, genetic engineering of these bacteria is often time consuming and labor intensive, if even possible. In this chapter, we describe the design and construction of pCRISPomyces, an engineered Type II CRISPR/Cas system, for targeted multiplex gene deletions in Streptomyces lividans, Streptomyces albus, and Streptomyces viridochromogenes with editing efficiency ranging from 70% to 100%. We demonstrate pCRISPomyces as a powerful tool for genome editing in Streptomyces.	Y Wang|RE Cobb|H Zhao
27407107	Despite many methodological advances that have facilitated investigation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis pathogenesis, analysis of essential gene function in this slow-growing pathogen remains difficult. Here, we describe an optimized CRISPR-based method to inhibit expression of essential genes based on the inducible expression of an enzymatically inactive Cas9 protein together with gene-specific guide RNAs (CRISPR interference). Using this system to target several essential genes of M. tuberculosis, we achieved marked inhibition of gene expression resulting in growth inhibition, changes in susceptibility to small molecule inhibitors and disruption of normal cell morphology. Analysis of expression of genes containing sequences similar to those targeted by individual guide RNAs did not reveal significant off-target effects. Advantages of this approach include the ability to compare inhibited gene expression to native levels of expression, lack of the need to alter the M. tuberculosis chromosome, the potential to titrate the extent of transcription inhibition, and the ability to avoid off-target effects. Based on the consistent inhibition of transcription and the simple cloning strategy described in this work, CRISPR interference provides an efficient approach to investigate essential gene function that may be particularly useful in characterizing genes of unknown function and potential targets for novel small molecule inhibitors.

27406776	Since genetics has shown that mutation predates selection, biology has developed within the Darwinian paradigm framework. However, a mechanism that produces favorable mutations preferentially in response to adaptive constraints has been recently identified. This mechanism, the CRISPR-Cas adaptive immunity system, is considered as a bona fide example of Lamarckian evolution, even if it only reflects loosely Lamarck's ideas. This unusual evolutionary process is made possible by two prokaryotic properties: i) somatic and germinal cells are not distinct sets of cells; ii) Archae and Bacteria very frequently integrate DNA fragments from the environment, and they therefore have access to a source of "ready-made" useful genetic information. The CRISPR-Cas is a defense system against viruses and plasmids that is based on the integration of genomic fragments of these infectious agents into the host genome, and that protects the host against subsequent infections. Therefore, this mechanism does produce advantageous mutations by integrating DNA from the environment and allowing its transmission to descendants. In conclusion, most of the time evolution relies on purely Darwinian processes, i.e. mutations occurring at random, but in a small minority of cases the occurrence of mutations is more or less biased, and is therefore more or less Lamarckian. Although they are rare, such processes are nevertheless important to our understanding of the plurality of modes of evolution.	D Casane|P Laurenti
27405721	Recently CRISPR-Cas9 system has been reported to be capable of targeting a viral RNA, and this phenomenon thus raises an interesting question of whether Cas9 can also influence translation of cellular mRNAs. Here, we show that both natural and catalytically dead Cas9 can repress mRNA translation of cellular genes, and that only the first 14 nt in the 5' end of sgRNA is essential for this process. CRISPR-Cas9 can suppress the protein expression of an unintended target gene without affecting its DNA sequence and causes unexpected phenotypic changes. Using the designed RNA aptamer-ligand complexes which physically obstruct translation machinery, we indicate that roadblock mechanism is responsible for this phenomenon. Our work suggests that studies on Cas9 should avoid the potential off-target effects by detecting the alteration of genes at both the DNA and protein levels.

27404981	CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing has been proposed as a therapeutic treatment for HIV-1 infection. CRISPR/Cas9 induced double strand breaks (DSBs) targeted to the integrated viral genome have been shown to decrease production of progeny virus. Unfortunately HIV-1 evolves rapidly and may readily produce CRISPR/Cas9 resistant strains. Here we used next-generation sequencing to characterize HIV-1 strains that developed resistance to six different CRISPR/Cas9 guide RNAs (gRNAs). Reverse transcriptase (RT) derived base substitution mutations were commonly found at sites encoding unpaired bases of RNA stem-loop structures. In addition to RT mutations, insertion and/or deletion (indel) mutations were common. Indels localized to the CRISPR/Cas9 cleavage site were major contributors to CRISPR gRNA resistance. While most indels at non-coding regions were a single base pair, 3 base pair indels were observed when a coding region of HIV-1 was targeted. The DSB repair event may preserve the HIV-1 reading frame, while destroying CRISPR gRNA homology. HIV-1 may be successfully edited by CRISPR/Cas9, but the virus remains competent for replication and resistant to further CRISPR/Cas9 targeting at that site. These observations strongly suggest that host DSB repair at CRISPR/Cas9 cleavage sites is a novel and important pathway that may contribute to HIV-1 therapeutic resistance.	KE Yoder|R Bundschuh

27403935	Lepidoptera suffer critical lack of genetic tools and heritable genome edition has been achieved only in a few model species. Here we demonstrate that the CRISPR/Cas9 system is highly efficient for genome editing in a non-model crop pest Lepidoptera, the noctuid moth Spodoptera littoralis. We knocked-out the olfactory receptor co-receptor Orco gene to investigate its function in Lepidoptera olfaction. We find that 89.6% of the injected individuals carried Orco mutations, 70% of which transmitted them to the next generation. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated Orco knockout caused defects in plant odor and sex pheromone olfactory detection in homozygous individuals. Our work genetically defines Orco as an essential OR partner for both host and mate detection in Lepidoptera, and demonstrates that CRISPR/Cas9 is a simple and highly efficient genome editing technique in noctuid pests opening new routes for gene function analysis and the development of novel pest control strategies.

27402178	Large chromosomal modifications have been performed in natural and laboratory evolution studies and hold tremendous potential for use in foundational research, medicine, and biotechnology applications. Recently, the type II bacterial Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeat and CRISPR-associated (CRISPR/Cas9) system has emerged as a powerful tool for genome editing in various organisms. In this study, we applied the CRISPR/Cas9 system to preform large fragment deletions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and compared the performance activity to that of a traditional method that uses the Latour system. Here we report in S. Cerevisiae the CRIPR/Cas9 system has been used to delete fragments exceeding 30 kb. The use of the CRISPR/Cas9 system for generating chromosomal segment excision showed some potential advantages over the Latour system. All the results indicated that CRISPR/Cas9 system was a rapid, efficient, low-cost, and versatile method for genome editing and that it can be applied in further studies in the fields of biology, agriculture, and medicine.

27387481	Thyroid hormone (T3) is essential for proper neurological development. The hormone, bound to its receptors, regulates gene transcription in part by modulating posttranslational modifications of histones. Methylation of DNA, which is established by the de novo DNA methyltransferase (DNMT)3a and DNMT3b, and maintained by DNMT1 is another epigenetic modification influencing gene transcription. The expression of Dnmt3a, but not other Dnmt genes, increases in mouse brain in parallel with the postnatal rise in plasma [T3]. We found that treatment of the mouse neuroblastoma cell line Neuro2a[TRβ1] with T3 caused rapid induction of Dnmt3a mRNA, which was resistant to protein synthesis inhibition, supporting that it is a direct T3-response gene. Injection of T3 into postnatal day 6 mice increased Dnmt3a mRNA in the brain by 1 hour. Analysis of two chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing datasets, and targeted analyses using chromatin immunoprecipitation, transfection-reporter assays, and in vitro DNA binding identified 2 functional T3-response elements (TREs) at the mouse Dnmt3a locus located +30.3 and +49.3 kb from the transcription start site. Thyroid hormone receptors associated with both of these regions in mouse brain chromatin, but with only 1 (+30.3 kb) in Neuro2a[TRβ1] cells. Deletion of the +30.3-kb TRE using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing eliminated or strongly reduced the Dnmt3a mRNA response to T3. Bioinformatics analysis showed that both TREs are highly conserved among eutherian mammals. Thyroid regulation of Dnmt3a may be an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for modulating global changes in DNA methylation during postnatal neurological development.

27384229	Human genetics research employs the two opposing approaches of forward and reverse genetics. While forward genetics identifies and links a mutation to an observed disease etiology, reverse genetics induces mutations in model organisms to study their role in disease. In most cases, causality for mutations identified by forward genetics is confirmed by reverse genetics through the development of genetically engineered animal models and an assessment of whether the model can recapitulate the disease. While many technological advances have helped improve these approaches, some gaps still remain. CRISPR/Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated), which has emerged as a revolutionary genetic engineering tool, holds great promise for closing such gaps. By combining the benefits of forward and reverse genetics, it has dramatically expedited human genetics research. We provide a perspective on the power of CRISPR-based forward and reverse genetics tools in human genetics and discuss its applications using some disease examples.

27378131	The CRISPR-Cas (CRISPR together with CRISPR-associated proteins) modules are the adaptive immune system, acting as an adaptive and heritable immune system in bacteria and archaea. CRISPR-based immunity acts by integrating short virus sequences in the cell's CRISPR locus, allowing the cell to remember, recognize, and clear infections. In this study, the homology of CRISPRs sequence in BIMs (bacteriophage-insensitive mutants) of Streptococcus thermophilus St-I were analyzed. Secondary structures of the repeats and the PAMs (protospacer-associated motif) of each CRISPR locus were also predicted. Results showed that CRISPR1 has 27 repeat-spacer units, 5 of them had duplicates; CRISPR2 has one repeat-spacer unit; CRISPR3 has 28 repeat-spacer units. Only BIM1 had a new spacer acquisition in CRISPR3, while BIM2 and BIM3 had no new spacers' insertion, thus indicating that while most CRISPR1 were more active than CRISPR3, new spacer acquisition occurred just in CRSPR3 in some situations. These findings will help establish the foundation for the study of CRSPR-Cas systems in lactic acid bacteria.	W Li|X Bian|SE Evivie|GC Huo
27373734	Genome editing with engineered nucleases (zinc finger nucleases, TAL effector nucleases s and Clustered regularly inter-spaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated) has recently been shown to have great promise in a variety of therapeutic and biotechnological applications. However, their exploitation in genetic analysis and clinical settings largely depends on their specificity for the intended genomic target. Large and complex genomes often contain highly homologous/repetitive sequences, which limits the specificity of genome editing tools and could result in off-target activity. Over the past few years, various computational approaches have been developed to assist the design process and predict/reduce the off-target activity of these nucleases. These tools could be efficiently used to guide the design of constructs for engineered nucleases and evaluate results after genome editing. This review provides a comprehensive overview of various databases, tools, web servers and resources for genome editing and compares their features and functionalities. Additionally, it also describes tools that have been developed to analyse post-genome editing results. The article also discusses important design parameters that could be considered while designing these nucleases. This review is intended to be a quick reference guide for experimentalists as well as computational biologists working in the field of genome editing with engineered nucleases.	V Periwal
27368642	The ability to address the CRISPR-Cas9 nuclease complex to any target DNA using customizable single-guide RNAs has now permitted genome engineering in many species. Here, we report its first successful use in a nonvascular plant, the moss Physcomitrella patens. Single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) were designed to target an endogenous reporter gene, PpAPT, whose inactivation confers resistance to 2-fluoroadenine. Transformation of moss protoplasts with these sgRNAs and the Cas9 coding sequence from Streptococcus pyogenes triggered mutagenesis at the PpAPT target in about 2% of the regenerated plants. Mainly, deletions were observed, most of them resulting from alternative end-joining (alt-EJ)-driven repair. We further demonstrate that, in the presence of a donor DNA sharing sequence homology with the PpAPT gene, most transgene integration events occur by homology-driven repair (HDR) at the target locus but also that Cas9-induced double-strand breaks are repaired with almost equal frequencies by mutagenic illegitimate recombination. Finally, we establish that a significant fraction of HDR-mediated gene targeting events (30%) is still possible in the absence of PpRAD51 protein, indicating that CRISPR-induced HDR is only partially mediated by the classical homologous recombination pathway.

27367513	Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein (Cas) has recently been adapted to enable efficient editing of the mammalian genome, opening novel avenues for therapeutic intervention of inherited diseases. In seeking to disrupt yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) in a Thy1-YFP transgenic mouse, we assessed the feasibility of utilizing the adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV2) to deliver CRISPR/Cas for gene modification of retinal cells in vivo.	Single guide RNA (sgRNA) plasmids were designed to target YFP, and after in vitro validation, selected guides were cloned into a dual AAV system. One AAV2 construct was used to deliver Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9), and the other delivered sgRNA against YFP or LacZ (control) in the presence of mCherry. Five weeks after intravitreal injection, retinal function was determined using electroretinography, and CRISPR/Cas-mediated gene modifications were quantified in retinal flat mounts.	Adeno-associated virus 2-mediated in vivo delivery of SpCas9 with sgRNA targeting YFP significantly reduced the number of YFP fluorescent cells of the inner retina of our transgenic mouse model. Overall, we found an 84.0% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 81.8-86.9) reduction of YFP-positive cells in YFP-sgRNA-infected retinal cells compared to eyes treated with LacZ-sgRNA. Electroretinography profiling found no significant alteration in retinal function following AAV2-mediated delivery of CRISPR/Cas components compared to contralateral untreated eyes.	Thy1-YFP transgenic mice were used as a rapid quantifiable means to assess the efficacy of CRISPR/Cas-based retinal gene modification in vivo. We demonstrate that genomic modification of cells in the adult retina can be readily achieved by viral-mediated delivery of CRISPR/Cas.

27366892	The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9-mediated genome targeting system has been applied to a variety of organisms, including plants. Compared to other genome-targeting technologies such as zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), the CRISPR/Cas9 system is easier to use and has much higher editing efficiency. In addition, multiple "single guide RNAs" (sgRNAs) with different target sequences can be designed to direct the Cas9 protein to multiple genomic sites for simultaneous multiplex editing. Here, we present a procedure for highly efficient multiplex genome targeting in monocot and dicot plants using a versatile and robust CRISPR/Cas9 vector system, emphasizing the construction of binary constructs with multiple sgRNA expression cassettes in one round of cloning using Golden Gate ligation. We also describe the genotyping of targeted mutations in transgenic plants by direct Sanger sequencing followed by decoding of superimposed sequencing chromatograms containing biallelic or heterozygous mutations using the Web-based tool DSDecode. © 2016 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

27366891	CRISPR/Cas9 technology is ideally suited for genome-wide screening applications due to the ease of generating guide RNAs (gRNAs) and the versatility of Cas9 or Cas9 derivatives to knockout, repress, or activate expression of target genes.

27363581	Cas9-based RNA-guided nuclease (RGN) has emerged to be a versatile method for genome editing due to the ease of construction of RGN reagents to target specific genomic sequences. The ability to control the activity of Cas9 with a high temporal resolution will facilitate tight regulation of genome editing processes for studying the dynamics of transcriptional regulation or epigenetic modifications in complex biological systems. Here we show that fusing ligand-binding domains of nuclear receptors to split Cas9 protein fragments can provide chemical control over split Cas9 activity. The method has allowed us to control Cas9 activity in a tunable manner with no significant background, which has been challenging for other inducible Cas9 constructs. We anticipate that our design will provide opportunities through the use of different ligand-binding domains to enable multiplexed genome regulation of endogenous genes in distinct loci through simultaneous chemical regulation of orthogonal Cas9 variants.

Here, we describe a forward genetic screening paradigm exploiting CRISPR-mediated genome editing coupled to a cell selection step by FACS to identify regulators of SQSTM1. Through systematic comparison of pooled libraries, we show that CRISPR is superior to RNAi in identifying known SQSTM1 modulators. A genome-wide CRISPR screen exposed MTOR signalling and the entire macroautophagy machinery as key regulators of SQSTM1 and identified several novel modulators including HNRNPM, SLC39A14, SRRD, PGK1 and the ufmylation cascade. We show that ufmylation regulates SQSTM1 by eliciting a cell type-specific ER stress response which induces SQSTM1 expression and results in its accumulation in the cytosol. This study validates pooled CRISPR screening as a powerful method to map the repertoire of cellular pathways that regulate the fate of an individual target protein.

27347757	The activities and genome-wide specificities of CRISPR-Cas Cpf1 nucleases are not well defined. We show that two Cpf1 nucleases from Acidaminococcus sp. BV3L6 and Lachnospiraceae bacterium ND2006 (AsCpf1 and LbCpf1, respectively) have on-target efficiencies in human cells comparable with those of the widely used Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9). We also report that four to six bases at the 3' end of the short CRISPR RNA (crRNA) used to program Cpf1 nucleases are insensitive to single base mismatches, but that many of the other bases in this region of the crRNA are highly sensitive to single or double substitutions. Using GUIDE-seq and targeted deep sequencing analyses performed with both Cpf1 nucleases, we were unable to detect off-target cleavage for more than half of 20 different crRNAs. Our results suggest that AsCpf1 and LbCpf1 are highly specific in human cells.	BP Kleinstiver|SQ Tsai|MS Prew|NT Nguyen|MM Welch|JM Lopez|ZR McCaw|MJ Aryee|JK Joung
27345434	Genome engineering is a powerful tool for a wide range of applications in biomedical research and medicine. The development of the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 system has revolutionized the field of gene editing, thus facilitating efficient genome editing through the creation of targeted double-strand breaks of almost any organism and cell type. In addition, CRISPR-Cas9 technology has been used successfully for many other purposes, including regulation of endogenous gene expression, epigenome editing, live-cell labelling of chromosomal loci, edition of single-stranded RNA and high-throughput gene screening. The implementation of the CRISPR-Cas9 system has increased the number of available technological alternatives for studying gene function, thus enabling generation of CRISPR-based disease models. Although many mechanistic questions remain to be answered and several challenges have yet to be addressed, the use of CRISPR-Cas9-based genome engineering technologies will increase our knowledge of disease processes and their treatment in the near future.

27343383	Cadherins have been identified as receptors of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) Cry1A toxins in several lepidopteran insects including the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera. Disruption of the cadherin gene HaCad has been genetically linked to resistance to Bt toxin Cry1Ac in H. armigera. By using the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9), HaCad from the Cry1Ac-susceptible SCD strain of H. armigera was successfully knocked out. A single positive CRISPR event with a frame shift deletion of 4 nucleotides was identified and made homozygous to create a knockout line named SCD-Cad. Western blotting confirmed that HaCad was no longer expressed in the SCD-Cad line while an intact HaCad of 210 kDa was present in the parental SCD strain. Insecticide bioassays were used to show that SCD-Cad exhibited 549-fold resistance to Cry1Ac compared with SCD, but no significant change in susceptibility to Cry2Ab. Our results not only provide strong reverse genetics evidence for HaCad as a functional receptor of Cry1Ac, but also demonstrate that the CRISPR/Cas9 technique can act as a powerful and efficient genome editing tool to study gene function in a global agricultural pest, H. armigera.

27342565	The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-associated (Cas) systems are adaptive immune systems of bacteria. A type II CRISPR-Cas9 system from Streptococcus pyogenes has recently been developed into a genome engineering tool for prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Here, we present a single-plasmid system which allows efficient genome editing of Bacillus subtilis The plasmid pJOE8999 is a shuttle vector that has a pUC minimal origin of replication for Escherichia coli, the temperature-sensitive replication origin of plasmid pE194(ts) for B. subtilis, and a kanamycin resistance gene working in both organisms. For genome editing, it carries the cas9 gene under the control of the B. subtilis mannose-inducible promoter PmanP and a single guide RNA (sgRNA)-encoding sequence transcribed via a strong promoter. This sgRNA guides the Cas9 nuclease to its target. The 20-nucleotide spacer sequence at the 5' end of the sgRNA sequence, responsible for target specificity, is located between BsaI sites. Thus, the target specificity is altered by changing the spacer sequences via oligonucleotides fitted between the BsaI sites. Cas9 in complex with the sgRNA induces double-strand breaks (DSBs) at its target site. Repair of the DSBs and the required modification of the genome are achieved by adding homology templates, usually two PCR fragments obtained from both sides of the target sequence. Two adjacent SfiI sites enable the ordered integration of these homology templates into the vector. The function of the CRISPR-Cas9 vector was demonstrated by introducing two large deletions in the B. subtilis chromosome and by repair of the trpC2 mutation of B. subtilis 168.	In prokaryotes, most methods used for scarless genome engineering are based on selection-counterselection systems. The disadvantages are often the lack of a suitable counterselection marker, the toxicity of the compounds needed for counterselection, and the requirement of certain mutations in the target strain. CRISPR-Cas systems were recently developed as important tools for genome editing. The single-plasmid system constructed for the genome editing of B. subtilis overcomes the problems of counterselection methods. It allows deletions and introduction of point mutations. It is easy to handle and very efficient, and it may be adapted for use in other firmicutes.	J Altenbuchner
27342128	In a type II clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) system, RNAs that are encoded at the CRISPR locus complex with the CRISPR-associated (Cas) protein Cas9 to form an RNA-guided nuclease that cleaves double-stranded DNAs at specific sites. In recent years, the CRISPR-Cas9 system has been successfully adapted for genome engineering in a wide range of organisms. Studies have indicated that a series of conformational changes in Cas9, coordinated by the RNA and the target DNA, direct the protein into its active conformation, yet details on these conformational changes, as well as their roles in the mechanism of function of Cas9, remain to be elucidated. Here, nucleic acid-dependent conformational changes in Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpyCas9) were investigated using the method of site-directed spin labeling (SDSL). Single nitroxide spin labels were attached, one at a time, at one of the two native cysteine residues (Cys80 and Cys574) of SpyCas9, and the spin-labeled proteins were shown to maintain their function. X-band continuous-wave electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of the nitroxide attached at Cys80 revealed conformational changes of SpyCas9 that are consistent with a large-scale domain re-arrangement upon binding to its RNA partner. The results demonstrate the use of SDSL to monitor conformational changes in CRISPR-Cas9, which will provide key information for understanding the mechanism of CRISPR function.

27341390	The ability to reprogram adult somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and the subsequent development of protocols for their differentiation into disease-relevant cell types have enabled in-depth molecular analyses of multiple disease states as hitherto impossible. Neurons differentiated from patient-specific iPSCs provide a means to recapitulate molecular phenotypes of neurodegenerative diseases in vitro. However, it remains challenging to conduct precise manipulations of gene expression in iPSC-derived neurons towards modeling complex human neurological diseases. The application of CRISPR/Cas9 to mammalian systems is revolutionizing the utilization of genome editing technologies in the study of molecular contributors to the pathogenesis of numerous diseases. Here, we demonstrate that CRISPRa and CRISPRi can be used to exert precise modulations of endogenous gene expression in fate-committed iPSC-derived neurons. This highlights CRISPRa/i as a major technical advancement in accessible tools for evaluating the specific contributions of critical neurodegenerative disease-related genes to neuropathogenesis.

27340770	CRISPR (Clustered Regularly-Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats)-Cas9 (CRISPR associated protein 9) has rapidly become the most promising genome editing tool with great potential to revolutionize medicine. Through guidance of a 20 nucleotide RNA (gRNA), CRISPR-Cas9 finds and cuts target protospacer DNA precisely 3 base pairs upstream of a PAM (Protospacer Adjacent Motif). The broken DNA ends are repaired by either NHEJ (Non-Homologous End Joining) resulting in small indels, or by HDR (Homology Directed Repair) for precise gene or nucleotide replacement. Theoretically, CRISPR-Cas9 could be used to modify any genomic sequences, thereby providing a simple, easy, and cost effective means of genome wide gene editing. However, the off-target activity of CRISPR-Cas9 that cuts DNA sites with imperfect matches with gRNA have been of significant concern because clinical applications require 100% accuracy. Additionally, CRISPR-Cas9 has unpredictable efficiency among different DNA target sites and the PAM requirements greatly restrict its genome editing frequency. A large number of efforts have been made to address these impeding issues, but much more is needed to fully realize the medical potential of CRISPR-Cas9. In this article, we summarize the existing problems and current advances of the CRISPR-Cas9 technology and provide perspectives for the ultimate perfection of Cas9-mediated genome editing.

27339038	As autotrophic prokaryotes, cyanobacteria are ideal chassis organisms for sustainable production of various useful compounds. The newly characterized cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus UTEX 2973 is a promising candidate for serving as a microbial cell factory because of its unusually rapid growth rate. Here, we seek to develop a genetic toolkit that enables extensive genomic engineering of Synechococcus 2973 by implementing a CRISPR/Cas9 editing system. We targeted the nblA gene because of its important role in biological response to nitrogen deprivation conditions.	First, we determined that the Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 enzyme is toxic in cyanobacteria, and conjugational transfer of stable, replicating constructs containing the cas9 gene resulted in lethality. However, after switching to a vector that permitted transient expression of the cas9 gene, we achieved markerless editing in 100 % of cyanobacterial exconjugants after the first patch. Moreover, we could readily cure the organisms of antibiotic resistance, resulting in a markerless deletion strain.	High expression levels of the Cas9 protein in Synechococcus 2973 appear to be toxic and result in cell death. However, introduction of a CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system on a plasmid backbone that leads to transient cas9 expression allowed for efficient markerless genome editing in a wild type genetic background.

27338021	CRISPR-Cas9 is a powerful genome editing technology, yet with off-target effects. Truncated sgRNAs (17nt) have been found to decrease off-target cleavage without affecting on-target disruption in 293T cells. However, the potency of 17nt sgRNAs relative to the full-length 20nt sgRNAs in stem cells, such as human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), has not been assessed. Using a GFP reporter system, we found that both 17nt and 20nt sgRNAs expressed by lentiviral vectors induce ~95% knockout (KO) in 293T cells, whereas the KO efficiencies are significantly lower in iPSCs (60-70%) and MSCs (65-75%). Furthermore, we observed a decrease of 10-20 percentage points in KO efficiency with 17nt sgRNAs compared to full-length sgRNAs in both iPSCs and MSCs. Off-target cleavage was observed in 17nt sgRNAs with 1-2nt but not 3-4nt mismatches; whereas 20nt sgRNAs with up to 5nt mismatches can still induce off-target mutations. Of interest, we occasionally observed off-target effects induced by the 17nt but not the 20nt sgRNAs. These results indicate the importance of balancing on-target gene cleavage potency with off-target effects: when efficacy is a major concern such as genome editing in stem cells, the use of 20nt sgRNAs is preferable.

27329784	CRISPR technology has rapidly changed the face of biological research, such that precise genome editing has now become routine for many labs within several years of its initial development. CRISPR/Cas9 (Clustered Regularly Interspace Short Palindromic Repeat/CRISPR-associated nuclease 9) gene editing system is a powerful and groundbreaking programmable genome editing technology developed based on an adaptive bacterial and archaea immune system resisting the invasion of exogenous nucleic acid. Compared with traditional genome editing technology, CRISPR/Cas9 system is easier, efficient and less cytotoxic. CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology has been applied to many aspects of cancer research, including research on tumor genes, constructing animal tumor models, screening tumor phenotypic-related and resistance-associated gene and cancer gene therapy. In this review, we focus on the application of the CRISPR screen for this fast moving field. Finally, we discuss practical aspects of screen design, and outline a further step forward in the rapidly expanding field of genome editing.

27325413	Emergence of novel genome engineering technologies such as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) has refocused attention on unresolved ethical complications of synthetic biology. Biosecurity concerns, deontological issues and human right aspects of genome editing have been the subject of in-depth debate; however, a lack of transparent regulatory guidelines, outdated governance codes, inefficient time-consuming clinical trial pathways and frequent misunderstanding of the scientific potential of cutting-edge technologies have created substantial obstacles to translational research in this area. While a precautionary principle should be applied at all stages of genome engineering research, the stigma of germline editing, synthesis of new life forms and unrealistic presentation of current technologies should not arrest the transition of new therapeutic, diagnostic or preventive tools from research to clinic. We provide a brief review on the present regulation of CRISPR and discuss the translational aspect of genome engineering research and patient autonomy with respect to the "right to try" potential novel non-germline gene therapies.

27321545	Chromobacterium violaceum is a free-living bacillus with several genes that enables it survival under different harsh environments such as oxidative and temperature stresses. Here we performed a label-free quantitative proteomic study to unravel the molecular mechanisms that enable C. violaceum to survive oxidative stress. To achieve this, total proteins extracted from control and C. violaceum cultures exposed during two hours with 8 mM hydrogen peroxide were analyzed using GeLC-MS proteomics. Analysis revealed that under the stress condition, the bacterium expressed proteins that protected it from the damage caused by reactive oxygen condition and decreasing the abundance of proteins responsible for bacterial growth and catabolism. GeLC-MS proteomics analysis provided an overview of the metabolic pathways involved in the response of C. violaceum to oxidative stress ultimately aggregating knowledge of the response of this organism to environmental stress. This study identified approximately 1500 proteins, generating the largest proteomic coverage of C. violaceum so far. We also detected proteins with unknown function that we hypothesize to be part of new mechanisms related to oxidative stress defense. Finally, we identified the mechanism of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR), which has not yet been reported for this organism.

27320613	We attempted to knock out the expression of Hanganutziu-Deicher (H-D) antigens through the use of a CRISPR (clustered regulatory interspaced short palindromic repeat)/Cas9 system for pig cytidine monophospho-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase (CMAH).	Plasmids expressing hCas9 and sgRNA for pCMAH were prepared by ligating oligos into the BbsI site of pX330. The N-terminal and C-terminal EGFP coding regions overlapping 482 bp were PCR-amplified and placed under a ubiquitous CAG promoter. The approximately 400-bp genomic fragments containing the sgRNA target sequence of pCMAH were placed into the multi-cloning sites flanked by the EGFP fragments. The pCAG-EGxxFP-target was mixed with pX330 with/without the sgRNA sequences and then introduced into HEK293T cells.	Four oligos and primers, gSO1, gSO3, gSO4, and gSO8, were nominated from 8 candidates. Among them, gSO1 showed the best efficiency. Pig endothelial cells (PECs) from an α-Gal knockout pig were then used to examine the changes in the expression of the H-D antigen by the knockout of the CMAH genome by the pX330-gS01.	Changes in the expression of the H-D antigen in the PECs with the CRISPR (gS01) were clear in comparison with those in the parental cells, on the basis of FACS analysis data. The expression of the H-D antigen can be knocked out by use of the CRISPR system for pCMAH, thus confirming that this system is a very convenient system for producing knockout pigs.

27318086	Mammalian zygote-mediated genome-engineering by CRISPR/Cas is currently used for the generation of genome-modified animals. Here we report that a Streptococcus thermophilus-1 derived orthologous CRISPR/Cas system, which recognizes the 5'-NNAGAA sequence as a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), is useful in mouse zygotes and is applicable for generating knockout mice (87.5%) and targeted knock-in mice (45.5%). The induced mutation could be inherited in the next generation. This novel CRISPR/Cas can expand the feasibility of the zygote-mediated generation of genome-modified animals that require an exact mutation design.

27317429	In utero electroporation (IUE) is commonly used to study cortical development of cerebrum by downregulating or overexpressing genes of interest in neural progenitor cells (NPCs) of small mammals. However, exogenous plasmids are lost or diluted over time. Furthermore, gene knockdown based on short-hairpin RNAs may exert nonspecific effects that lead to aberrant neuronal migration. Genomic engineering by the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated 9 (Cas9) system has great research and therapeutic potentials. Here we integrate the CRISPR/Cas9 components into the piggyBac (PB) transposon system (the CRISPR/Cas9-PB toolkit) for cortical IUEs. The mouse Sry-related HMG box-2 (Sox2) gene was selected as the target for its application. Most transduced cortical NPCs were depleted of SOX2 protein as early as 3 days post-IUE, whereas expressions of SOX1 and PAX6 remained intact. Furthermore, both the WT Cas9 and the D10A nickase mutant Cas9n showed comparable knockout efficiency. Transduced cortical cells were purified with fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and effective gene editing at the Sox2 loci was confirmed. Thus, application of the CRISPR/Cas9-PB toolkit in IUE is a promising strategy to study gene functions in cortical NPCs and their progeny. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

27315329	Genome editing by CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas9 (CRISPR-associated gene 9) system has been transformative in biology. Originally discovered as an adaptive prokaryotic immune system, CRISPR/Cas9 has been repurposed for genome editing in a broad range of model organisms, from yeast to mammalian cells. Protist parasites are unicellular organisms producing important human diseases that affect millions of people around the world. For many of these diseases, such as malaria, Chagas disease, leishmaniasis and cryptosporidiosis, there are no effective treatments or vaccines available. The recent adaptation of the CRISPR/Cas9 technology to several protist models will be playing a key role in the functional study of their proteins, in the characterization of their metabolic pathways, and in the understanding of their biology, and will facilitate the search for new chemotherapeutic targets. In this work we review recent studies where the CRISPR/Cas9 system was adapted to protist parasites, particularly to Apicomplexans and trypanosomatids, emphasizing the different molecular strategies used for genome editing of each organism, as well as their advantages. We also discuss the potential usefulness of this technology in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.	N Lander|MA Chiurillo|R Docampo

27307560	The nonclassical HLA molecule MHC-related protein 1 (MR1) presents metabolites of the vitamin B synthesis pathways to mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells and other MR1-restricted T cells. This new class of Ags represents a variation on the classical paradigm of self/non-self discrimination because these T cells are activated through their TCR by small organic compounds generated during microbial vitamin B2 synthesis. Beyond the fundamental significance, the invariant nature of MR1 across the human population is a tantalizing feature for the potential development of universal immune therapeutic and diagnostic tools. However, many aspects of MR1 Ag presentation and MR1-restricted T cell biology remain unknown, and the ubiquitous expression of MR1 across tissues and cell lines can be a confounding factor for experimental purposes. In this study, we report the development of a novel CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing lentiviral system and its use to efficiently disrupt MR1 expression in A459, THP-1, and K562 cell lines. We generated isogenic MR1(-/-) clonal derivatives of the A549 lung carcinoma and THP-1 monocytic cell lines and used these to study T cell responses to intracellular pathogens. We confirmed that MAIT cell clones were unable to respond to MR1(-/-) clones infected with bacteria whereas Ag presentation by classical and other nonclassical HLAs was unaffected. This system represents a robust and efficient method to disrupt the expression of MR1 and should facilitate investigations into the processing and presentation of MR1 Ags as well as into the biology of MAIT cells.

27305774	To better adapt to the environment, prokaryocyte can take up exogenous genes (from bacteriophages, plasmids or genomes of other species) through horizontal gene transfer. Accompanied by the acquisition of exogenous genes, prokaryocyte is challenged by the invasion of 'selfish genes'. Therefore, to protect against the risk of gene transfer, prokaryocyte needs to establish mechanisms for selectively taking up or degrading exogenous DNA. In recent years, researchers discovered an adaptive immunity, which is mediated by the small RNA guided DNA degradation, prevents the invasion of exogenous genes in prokaryocyte. During the immune process, partial DNA fragments are firstly integrated.to the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) located within the genome DNA, and then the mature CRISPR RNA transcript and the CRISPR associated proteins (Cas) form a complex CRISPR/Cas for degrading exogenous DNA. In this review, we will first briefly describe the CRISPR/Cas systems and then mainly focus on the recent advances of the function mechanism and the regulation mechanism of the type I-E CRISPR/Cas system in Escherichia coli.

27302758	Here we present the first genomic characterization of viruses infecting Nostoc, a genus of ecologically important cyanobacteria that are widespread in freshwater. Cyanophages A-1 and N-1 were isolated in the 1970s and infect Nostoc sp. strain PCC 7210 but remained genomically uncharacterized. Their 68,304- and 64,960-bp genomes are strikingly different from those of other sequenced cyanophages. Many putative genes that code for proteins with known functions are similar to those found in filamentous cyanobacteria, showing a long evolutionary history in their host. Cyanophage N-1 encodes a CRISPR array that is transcribed during infection and is similar to the DR5 family of CRISPRs commonly found in cyanobacteria. The presence of a host-related CRISPR array in a cyanophage suggests that the phage can transfer the CRISPR among related cyanobacteria and thereby provide resistance to infection with competing phages. Both viruses also encode a distinct DNA polymerase B that is closely related to those found in plasmids of Cyanothece sp. strain PCC 7424, Nostoc sp. strain PCC 7120, and Anabaena variabilis ATCC 29413. These polymerases form a distinct evolutionary group that is more closely related to DNA polymerases of proteobacteria than to those of other viruses. This suggests that the polymerase was acquired from a proteobacterium by an ancestral virus and transferred to the cyanobacterial plasmid. Many other open reading frames are similar to a prophage-like element in the genome of Nostoc sp. strain PCC 7524. The Nostoc cyanophages reveal a history of gene transfers between filamentous cyanobacteria and their viruses that have helped to forge the evolutionary trajectory of this previously unrecognized group of phages.	Filamentous cyanobacteria belonging to the genus Nostoc are widespread and ecologically important in freshwater, yet little is known about the genomic content of their viruses. Here we report the first genomic analysis of cyanophages infecting filamentous freshwater cyanobacteria, revealing that their gene content is unlike that of other cyanophages. In addition to sharing many gene homologues with freshwater cyanobacteria, cyanophage N-1 encodes a CRISPR array and expresses it upon infection. Also, both viruses contain a DNA polymerase B-encoding gene with high similarity to genes found in proteobacterial plasmids of filamentous cyanobacteria. The observation that phages can acquire CRISPRs from their hosts suggests that phages can also move them among hosts, thereby conferring resistance to competing phages. The presence in these cyanophages of CRISPR and DNA polymerase B sequences, as well as a suite of other host-related genes, illustrates the long and complex evolutionary history of these viruses and their hosts.

27300134	Maternal obesity, a major risk factor for adverse pregnancy complications, results in inflammatory cytokine release in the placenta. Levels of free fatty acids are elevated in the plasma of obese human. These fatty acids include obesity-related palmitic acids, which is a major saturated fatty acid, that promotes inflammatory responses. Increasing evidence indicates that nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasomes mediate inflammatory responses induced by endogenous danger signals. We hypothesized that inflammatory responses associated with gestational obesity cause inflammation. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the effect of palmitic acid on the activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes and inflammatory responses in a human Sw.71 trophoblast cell line. Palmitic acid stimulated caspase-1 activation and markedly increased interleukin (IL)-1β secretion in Sw.71 cells. Treatment with a caspase-1 inhibitor diminished palmitic acid-induced IL-1β release. In addition, NLRP3 and caspase-1 genome editing using a CRISPR/Cas9 system in Sw.71 cells suppressed IL-1β secretion, which was stimulated by palmitic acid. Moreover, palmitic acid stimulated caspase-3 activation and inflammatory cytokine secretion (e.g., IL-6 and IL-8). Palmitic acid-induced cytokine secretion were dependent on caspase-3 activation. In addition, palmitic acid-induced IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 secretion was depended on reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. In conclusion, palmitic acid caused activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes and inflammatory responses, inducing IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 secretion, which is associated with ROS generation, in human Sw.71 placental cells. We suggest that obesity-related palmitic acid induces placental inflammation, resulting in association with pregnancy complications.

27299480	Pathogen-specific acquired immunity in bacteria is mediated by the CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-Cas systems. Thermus thermophilus strain HB8 contains CRISPR systems of several major subtypes (type I, IIIA and IIIB), and has become a widely studied model for CRISPR biology. We have selected two highly expressed CRISPR spacers, crRNA 2.1 and crRNA 2.2, and have enriched endogenous T. thermophilus proteins that co-purify with these crRNAs. Mass spectroscopy indicates that the chromatography protocol enriches predominantly Csm complex subunits, but also Cmr subunits. After several chromatographic steps, size exclusion chromatography indicated a molecular mass of the crRNA associated complex of 265±69 kDa. In agreement with earlier work, crRNAs of different lengths (containing the selected spacers) were observed. Most of these were completely lost when several T. thermophilus csm genes were ablated.

27285851	Replication defective lentiviruses or retroviruses are capable of stably integrating transgenes into the genome of an infected host cell. This technique has been widely used to encode fluorescent proteins, opto- or chemo-genetic controllers of cell activity, or heterologous expression of human genes in model organisms. These viruses have also successfully been used to deliver recombinases to relevant target sites in transgenic animals, or even deliver small hairpin or micro RNAs in order to manipulate gene expression. While these techniques have been fruitful, they rely on transgenic animals (recombinases) or frequently lack high efficacy and specificity (shRNA/miRNA). In contrast, the CRISPR/Cas system uses an exogenous Cas nuclease which targets specific sites in an organism's genome via an exogenous guide RNA in order to induce double stranded breaks in DNA. These breaks are then repaired by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), producing insertion and deletion (indel) mutations that can result in deleterious missense or nonsense mutations. This manuscript provides detailed methods for the design, production, injection, and validation of single lenti/retro virus particles that can stably transduce neurons to express a fluorescent reporter, Cas9, and sgRNAs to knockout genes in a model organism.

27284635	Engineering efficient biosynthesis of natural products in microorganisms requires optimizing gene expression levels to balance metabolite flux distributions and to minimize accumulation of toxic intermediates. Such metabolic optimization is challenged with identifying the right gene targets, and then determining and achieving appropriate gene expression levels. After decades of having a relatively limited set of gene regulation tools available, metabolic engineers are recently enjoying an ever-growing repertoire of more precise and tunable gene expression platforms. Here we review recent applications of natural and designed transcriptional and translational regulatory machinery for engineering biosynthesis of natural products in microorganisms. Customized trans-acting RNAs (sgRNA, asRNA and sRNA), along with appropriate accessory proteins, are allowing for unparalleled tuning of gene expression. Meanwhile metabolite-responsive transcription factors and riboswitches have been implemented in strain screening and evolution, and in dynamic gene regulation. Further refinements and expansions on these platform technologies will circumvent many long-term obstacles in natural products biosynthesis.	Z Wang|PC Cirino
27284167	The ability to write a stable record of identified molecular events into a specific genomic locus would enable the examination of long cellular histories and have many applications, ranging from developmental biology to synthetic devices. We show that the type I-E CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-Cas system of Escherichia coli can mediate acquisition of defined pieces of synthetic DNA. We harnessed this feature to generate records of specific DNA sequences into a population of bacterial genomes. We then applied directed evolution so as to alter the recognition of a protospacer adjacent motif by the Cas1-Cas2 complex, which enabled recording in two modes simultaneously. We used this system to reveal aspects of spacer acquisition, fundamental to the CRISPR-Cas adaptation process. These results lay the foundations of a multimodal intracellular recording device.

27274087	There is growing evidence that zinc and its transporters are involved in cell migration during development and in cancer. In the present study, we show that zinc transporter ZIP10 (SLC39A10) stimulates cell motility and proliferation, both in mammalian cells and in the zebrafish embryo. This is associated with inactivation of GSK (glycogen synthase kinase)-3α and -3β and down-regulation of E-cadherin (CDH1). Morpholino-mediated knockdown of zip10 causes delayed epiboly and deformities of the head, eye, heart and tail. Furthermore, zip10 deficiency results in overexpression of cdh1, zip6 and stat3, the latter gene product driving transcription of both zip6 and zip10 The non-redundant requirement of Zip6 and Zip10 for epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is consistent with our finding that they exist as a heteromer. We postulate that a subset of ZIPs carrying prion protein (PrP)-like ectodomains, including ZIP6 and ZIP10, are integral to cellular pathways and plasticity programmes, such as EMT.

27273122	Advanced biological technologies allowing for genetic manipulation of the genome are increasingly being used to unravel the molecular pathogenesis of human diseases. The clustered regulatory interspaced short palindromic repeat/CRISPR-associated protein (CRISPR/Cas) technology started a revolution of this field owing to its flexibility and relative ease of use. Recently, application of the CRISPR/Cas9 system has been extended to in vivo approaches, leveraging its potential for human disease modeling. Particularly in oncological research, where genetic defects in somatic cells are tightly linked to etiology and pathological phenotypes, the CRISPR/Cas technology is being used to recapitulate various types of genetic aberrations. Here we review murine cancer models that have been developed via combining the CRISPR/Cas9 technology with in vivo somatic gene transfer approaches. Exploiting these methodological advances will further accelerate detailed investigations of tumor etiology and treatment.	M Zuckermann|D Kawauchi|J Gronych

27272384	Programmable clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) Cpf1 endonucleases are single-RNA-guided (crRNA) enzymes that recognize thymidine-rich protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) sequences and produce cohesive double-stranded breaks (DSBs). Genome editing with CRISPR-Cpf1 endonucleases could provide an alternative to CRISPR-Cas9 endonucleases, but the determinants of targeting specificity are not well understood. Using mismatched crRNAs we found that Cpf1 could tolerate single or double mismatches in the 3' PAM-distal region, but not in the 5' PAM-proximal region. Genome-wide analysis of cleavage sites in vitro for eight Cpf1 nucleases using Digenome-seq revealed that there were 6 (LbCpf1) and 12 (AsCpf1) cleavage sites per crRNA in the human genome, fewer than are present for Cas9 nucleases (>90). Most Cpf1 off-target cleavage sites did not produce mutations in cells. We found mismatches in either the 3' PAM-distal region or in the PAM sequence of 12 off-target sites that were validated in vivo. Off-target effects were completely abrogated by using preassembled, recombinant Cpf1 ribonucleoproteins.	D Kim|J Kim|JK Hur|KW Been|SH Yoon|JS Kim
27272125	Engineered endonucleases such as homing endonucleases (HEs), zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), Tal-effector nucleases (TALENS) and the RNA-guided engineered nucleases (RGENs or CRISPR/Cas9) can target specific DNA sequences for cleavage, and are proving to be valuable tools for gene editing. Recently engineered endonucleases have shown great promise as therapeutics for the treatment of genetic disease and infectious pathogens. In this review, we discuss recent efforts to use the HE, ZFN, TALEN and CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing platforms as antiviral therapeutics. We also discuss the obstacles facing gene-editing antiviral therapeutics as they are tested in animal models of disease and transition towards human application.	D Stone|N Niyonzima|KR Jerome
27265864	Both Fras1 and Itga8 connect mesenchymal cells to epithelia by way of an extracellular 'Fraser protein complex' that functions in signaling and adhesion; these proteins are vital to the development of several vertebrate organs. We previously found that zebrafish fras1 mutants have craniofacial defects, specifically, shortened symplectic cartilages and cartilage fusions that spare joint elements. During a forward mutagenesis screen, we identified a new zebrafish mutation, b1161, that we show here disrupts itga8, as confirmed using CRISPR-generated itga8 alleles. fras1 and itga8 single mutants and double mutants have similar craniofacial phenotypes, a result expected if loss of either gene disrupts function of the Fraser protein complex. Unlike fras1 mutants or other Fraser-related mutants, itga8 mutants do not show blistered tail fins. Thus, the function of the Fraser complex differs in the craniofacial skeleton and the tail fin. Focusing on the face, we find that itga8 mutants consistently show defective outpocketing of a late-forming portion of the first pharyngeal pouch, and variably express skeletal defects, matching previously characterized fras1 mutant phenotypes. In itga8 and fras1 mutants, skeletal severity varies markedly between sides, indicating that both mutants have increased developmental instability. Whereas fras1 is expressed in epithelia, we show that itga8 is expressed complementarily in facial mesenchyme. Paired with the observed phenotypic similarity, this expression indicates that the genes function in epithelial-mesenchymal interactions. Similar interactions between Fras1 and Itga8 have previously been found in mouse kidney, where these genes both regulate Nephronectin (Npnt) protein abundance. We find that zebrafish facial tissues express both npnt and the Fraser gene fibrillin2b (fbn2b), but their transcript levels do not depend on fras1 or itga8 function. Using a revertible fras1 allele, we find that the critical window for fras1 function in the craniofacial skeleton is between 1.5 and 3 days post fertilization, which coincides with the onset of fras1-dependent and itga8-dependent morphogenesis. We propose a model wherein Fras1 and Itga8 interact during late pharyngeal pouch morphogenesis to sculpt pharyngeal arches through epithelial-mesenchymal interactions, thereby stabilizing the developing craniofacial skeleton.

27261202	DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are dangerous lesions that if not properly repaired can lead to genomic change or cell death. Organisms have developed several pathways and have many factors devoted to repairing DSBs, which broadly occurs by homologous recombination, which relies on an identical or homologous sequence to template repair, or nonhomologous end-joining. Much of our understanding of these repair mechanisms has come from the study of induced DNA cleavage by site-specific endonucleases. In addition to their biological role, these cellular pathways can be co-opted for gene editing to study gene function or for gene therapy or other applications. While the first gene editing experiments were done more than 20 years ago, the recent discovery of RNA-guided endonucleases has simplified approaches developed over the years to make gene editing an approach that is available to the entire biomedical research community. Here, we review DSB repair mechanisms and site-specific cleavage systems that have provided insight into these mechanisms and led to the current gene editing revolution.	M Jasin|JE Haber
27260157	CRISPR/Cas9 has emerged as a powerful new tool to systematically probe gene function. We compared the performance of CRISPR to RNAi-based loss-of-function screens for the identification of cancer dependencies across multiple cancer cell lines. CRISPR dropout screens consistently identified more lethal genes than RNAi, implying that the identification of many cellular dependencies may require full gene inactivation. However, in two aneuploid cancer models, we found that all genes within highly amplified regions, including nonexpressed genes, scored as lethal by CRISPR, revealing an unanticipated class of false-positive hits. In addition, using a CRISPR tiling screen, we found that sgRNAs targeting essential domains generate the strongest lethality phenotypes and thus provide a strategy to rapidly define the protein domains required for cancer dependence. Collectively, these findings not only demonstrate the utility of CRISPR screens in the identification of cancer-essential genes, but also reveal the need to carefully control for false-positive results in chromosomally unstable cancer lines.	We show in this study that CRISPR-based screens have a significantly lower false-negative rate compared with RNAi-based screens, but have specific liabilities particularly in the interrogation of regions of genome amplification. Therefore, this study provides critical insights for applying CRISPR-based screens toward the systematic identification of new cancer targets.

27260156	The CRISPR/Cas9 system enables genome editing and somatic cell genetic screens in mammalian cells. We performed genome-scale loss-of-function screens in 33 cancer cell lines to identify genes essential for proliferation/survival and found a strong correlation between increased gene copy number and decreased cell viability after genome editing. Within regions of copy-number gain, CRISPR/Cas9 targeting of both expressed and unexpressed genes, as well as intergenic loci, led to significantly decreased cell proliferation through induction of a G2 cell-cycle arrest. By examining single-guide RNAs that map to multiple genomic sites, we found that this cell response to CRISPR/Cas9 editing correlated strongly with the number of target loci. These observations indicate that genome targeting by CRISPR/Cas9 elicits a gene-independent antiproliferative cell response. This effect has important practical implications for the interpretation of CRISPR/Cas9 screening data and confounds the use of this technology for the identification of essential genes in amplified regions.	We found that the number of CRISPR/Cas9-induced DNA breaks dictates a gene-independent antiproliferative response in cells. These observations have practical implications for using CRISPR/Cas9 to interrogate cancer gene function and illustrate that cancer cells are highly sensitive to site-specific DNA damage, which may provide a path to novel therapeutic strategies.

27258160	The SLAM family receptors contribute to diverse aspects of lymphocyte biology and signal via the small adaptor molecule SAP. Mutations affecting SAP lead to X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome Type 1, a severe immunodysregulation characterized by fulminant mononucleosis, dysgammaglobulinemia, and lymphoproliferation/lymphomas. Patients and mice having mutations affecting SAP also lack germinal centers due to a defect in T:B cell interactions and are devoid of invariant NKT (iNKT) cells. However, which and how SLAM family members contribute to these phenotypes remains uncertain. Three SLAM family members: SLAMF1, SLAMF5 and SLAMF6, are highly expressed on T follicular helper cells and germinal center B cells. SLAMF1 and SLAMF6 are also implicated in iNKT development. Although individual receptor knockout mice have limited iNKT and germinal center phenotypes compared to SAP knockout mice, the generation of multi-receptor knockout mice has been challenging, due to the genomic linkage of the genes encoding SLAM family members. Here, we used Cas9/CRISPR-based mutagenesis to generate mutations simultaneously in Slamf1, Slamf5 and Slamf6. Genetic disruption of all three receptors in triple-knockout mice (TKO) did not grossly affect conventional T or B cell development and led to mild defects in germinal center formation post-immunization. However, the TKO worsened defects in iNKT cells development seen in SLAMF6 single gene-targeted mice, supporting data on positive signaling and potential redundancy between these receptors.

27256883	The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated genes (Cas) adaptive immune system defends microbes against foreign genetic elements via DNA or RNA-DNA interference. We characterize the class 2 type VI CRISPR-Cas effector C2c2 and demonstrate its RNA-guided ribonuclease function. C2c2 from the bacterium Leptotrichia shahii provides interference against RNA phage. In vitro biochemical analysis shows that C2c2 is guided by a single CRISPR RNA and can be programmed to cleave single-stranded RNA targets carrying complementary protospacers. In bacteria, C2c2 can be programmed to knock down specific mRNAs. Cleavage is mediated by catalytic residues in the two conserved Higher Eukaryotes and Prokaryotes Nucleotide-binding (HEPN) domains, mutations of which generate catalytically inactive RNA-binding proteins. These results broaden our understanding of CRISPR-Cas systems and suggest that C2c2 can be used to develop new RNA-targeting tools.

27250347	Recent advances in genome-editing techniques have made it possible to modify any desired DNA sequence by employing programmable nucleases. These next-generation genome-modifying tools are the ideal candidates for therapeutic applications, especially for the treatment of genetic disorders like sickle cell disease (SCD). SCD is an inheritable monogenic disorder which is caused by a point mutation in the β-globin gene. Substantial success has been achieved in the development of supportive therapeutic strategies for SCD, but unfortunately there is still a lack of long-term universal cure. The only existing curative treatment is based on allogeneic stem cell transplantation from healthy donors; however, this treatment is applicable to a limited number of patients only. Hence, a universally applicable therapy is highly desirable. In this review, we will discuss the three programmable nucleases that are commonly used for genome-editing purposes: zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9). We will continue by exemplifying uses of these methods to correct the sickle cell mutation. Additionally, we will present induction of fetal globin expression as an alternative approach to cure sickle cell disease. We will conclude by comparing the three methods and explaining the concerns about their use in therapy.	I Tasan|S Jain|H Zhao
27250031	Cancer is caused by a series of alterations in genome and epigenome mostly resulting in activation of oncogenes or inactivation of cancer suppressor genes. Genetic engineering has become pivotal in the treatment of cancer and other genetic diseases, especially the formerly-niche use of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) associated with Cas9. In defining its superior use, we have followed the recent advances that have been made in producing CRISPR/Cas9 as a therapy of choice. We also provide important genetic mutations where CRISPRs can be repurposed to create adaptive immunity to fight carcinomas and edit genetic mutations causing it. Meanwhile, challenges to CRISPR technology are also discussed with emphasis on ability of pathogens to evolve against CRISPRs. We follow the recent developments on the function of CRISPRs with different carriers which can efficiently deliver it to target cells; furthermore, analogous technologies are also discussed along CRISPRs, including zinc-finger nuclease (ZFN) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs). Moreover, progress in clinical applications of CRISPR therapeutics is reviewed; in effect, patients can have lower morbidity and/or mortality from the therapeutic method with least possible side-effects.

27246398	Podocytes are terminally differentiated and highly specialized cells in the glomerulus, and they form a crucial component of the glomerular filtration barrier. The ICGN mouse is a model of glomerular dysfunction that shows gross morphological changes in the podocyte foot process, accompanied by proteinuria. Previously, we demonstrated that proteinuria in ICR-derived glomerulonephritis mouse ICGN mice might be caused by a deletion mutation in the tensin2 (Tns2) gene (designated Tns2nph). To test whether this mutation causes the mutant phenotype, we created knockout (KO) mice carrying a Tns2 protein deletion in the C-terminal Src homology and phosphotyrosine binding (SH2-PTB) domains (designated Tns2ΔC) via CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing. Tns2nph/Tns2ΔC compound heterozygotes and Tns2ΔC/Tns2ΔC homozygous KO mice displayed podocyte abnormalities and massive proteinuria similar to ICGN mice, indicating that these two mutations are allelic. Further, this result suggests that the SH2-PTB domain of Tns2 is required for podocyte integrity. Tns2 knockdown in a mouse podocyte cell line significantly enhanced actin stress fiber formation and cell migration. Thus, this study provides evidence that alteration of actin remodeling resulting from Tns2 deficiency causes morphological changes in podocytes and subsequent proteinuria.

27236514	CRISPR/Cas9 system has been used widely in animals and plants to direct mutagenesis. To date, no such method exists for fish somatic cell lines. We describe an efficient procedure for genome editing in the Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha CHSE. This cell line was genetically modified to firstly overexpress a monomeric form of EGFP (cell line CHSE-E Geneticin resistant) and additionally to overexpress nCas9n, a nuclear version of Cas9 (cell line CHSE-EC, Hygromycin and Geneticin resistant). A pre-validated sgRNA was produced in vitro and used to transfect CHSE-EC cells. The EGFP gene was disrupted in 34.6 % of cells, as estimated by FACS and microscopy. The targeted locus was characterised by PCR amplification, cloning and sequencing of PCR products; inactivation of the EGFP gene by deletions in the expected site was validated in 25 % of clones. This method opens perspectives for functional genomic studies compatible with high-throughput screening.	CE Dehler|P Boudinot|SA Martin|B Collet
27231109	The present era is fast experiencing rapid innovation in the genome-editing technology. CRISPR Cas9-mediated targeted genetic manipulation is an easy, cost-effective and scalable method. As a result, it can be used for a broad range of targeted genome engineering.	The main objective of the present review is to highlight the structural signature, classification, its mechanism and application from basic science to medicine and future challenges for this genome editing tool kit.	The present review provides a brief description of the recent development of CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technology. We discuss the paradigms shift for this next generation genome editing technology, CRISPR. The CRISPR structural significance, classification and its different applications are also being discussed. We portray the future challenges for this extraordinary genome in vivo editing tool. We also highlight the role of CRISPR genome editing in curing many diseases.	Scientists and researchers are constantly looking one genome editing tool that is competent, simple and low-cost assembly of nucleases. It can target any particular site without any off-target mutations in the genome. The CRISPR-Cas9 has all of the above characteristics. The genome engineering technology may be a strong and inspiring technology meant for the next generation of drug development.	C Chakraborty|SL Teoh|S Das
27230379	Linkage and association studies have mapped thousands of genomic regions that contribute to phenotypic variation, but narrowing these regions to the underlying causal genes and variants has proven much more challenging. Resolution of genetic mapping is limited by the recombination rate. We developed a method that uses CRISPR (clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats) to build mapping panels with targeted recombination events. We tested the method by generating a panel with recombination events spaced along a yeast chromosome arm, mapping trait variation, and then targeting a high density of recombination events to the region of interest. Using this approach, we fine-mapped manganese sensitivity to a single polymorphism in the transporter Pmr1. Targeting recombination events to regions of interest allows us to rapidly and systematically identify causal variants underlying trait differences.	MJ Sadhu|JS Bloom|L Day|L Kruglyak
27226347	Thousands of sense-antisense mRNA-lncRNA gene pairs occur in the mammalian genome. While there is usually little doubt about the function of the coding transcript, the function of the lncRNA partner is mostly untested. Here we examine the function of the homeotic Evx1-Evx1as gene locus. Expression is tightly co-regulated in posterior mesoderm of mouse embryos and in embryoid bodies. Expression of both genes is enhanced by BMP4 and WNT3A, and reduced by Activin. We generated a suite of deletions in the locus by CRISPR-Cas9 editing. We show EVX1 is a critical downstream effector of BMP4 and WNT3A with respect to patterning of posterior mesoderm. The lncRNA, Evx1as arises from alternative promoters and is difficult to fully abrogate by gene editing or siRNA approaches. Nevertheless, we were able to generate a large 2.6 kb deletion encompassing the shared promoter with Evx1 and multiple additional exons of Evx1as. This led to an identical dorsal-ventral patterning defect to that generated by micro-deletion in the DNA-binding domain of EVX1. Thus, Evx1as has no function independent of EVX1, and is therefore unlikely to act in trans. We predict many antisense lncRNAs have no specific trans function, possibly only regulating the linked coding genes in cis.

27224051	Tyrosinase is a key enzyme in melanin biosynthesis. Mutations in the gene encoding tyrosinase (Tyr) cause oculocutaneous albinism (OCA1) in humans. Alleles of the Tyr gene have been useful in studying pigment biology and coat color formation. Over 100 different Tyr alleles have been reported in mice, of which ≈24% are spontaneous mutations, ≈60% are radiation-induced, and the remaining alleles were obtained by chemical mutagenesis and gene targeting. Therefore, most mutations were random and could not be predicted a priori. Using the CRISPR-Cas9 system, we targeted two distinct regions of exon 1 to induce pigmentation changes and used an in vivo visual phenotype along with heteroduplex mobility assays (HMA) as readouts of CRISPR-Cas9 activity. Most of the mutant alleles result in complete loss of tyrosinase activity leading to an albino phenotype. In this study, we describe two novel in-frame deletion alleles of Tyr, dhoosara (Sanskrit for gray) and chandana (Sanskrit for sandalwood). These alleles are hypomorphic and show lighter pigmentation phenotypes of the body and eyes. This study demonstrates the utility of CRISPR-Cas9 system in generating domain-specific in-frame deletions and helps gain further insights into structure-function of Tyr gene.

27223891	SAP (SH2D1A) is required intrinsically in CD4 T cells to generate germinal center responses and long-term humoral immunity. SAP binds to SLAM family receptors, including SLAM, CD84, and Ly108 to enhance cytokine secretion and sustained T cell:B cell adhesion, which both improve T follicular helper (Tfh) cell aid to germinal center (GC) B cells. To understand the overlapping roles of multiple SLAM family receptors in germinal center responses, Slamf1Δ/Δ Slamf5Δ/Δ Slamf6Δ/Δ triple gene disruption (Slamf1,5,6Δ/Δ) mice were generated using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing to eliminate expression of SLAM (CD150), CD84, and Ly108, respectively. Gene targeting was highly efficient, with 6 of 6 alleles disrupted in 14 of 23 pups and the majority of alleles disrupted in the remaining pups. NKT cell differentiation in Slamf1,5,6Δ/Δ mice was defective, but not completely absent. The remaining NKT cells exhibited substantially increased 2B4 (SLAMF4) expression. Surprisingly, there were no overt defects in germinal center responses to acute viral infections or protein immunizations in Slamf1,5,6Δ/Δ mice, unlike Sh2d1a-/- mice. Similarly, in the context of a competitive environment, SLAM family receptor expressing GC Tfh cell, GC B cell, and plasma cell responses exhibited no advantages over Slamf1,5,6Δ/Δ cells.

27221047	The parthenotes represent ideal models mimicking the embryonic development and characterizing the function of maternal genomes as well as an alternative source of pluripotent cell lines. Besides, parthenogenetically activated (PA) embryos serve as a rapid assay system to maximize the efficiency of generating genetically modified pig CRISPR/Cas9 system, an efficient and multiplex gene editing tool, has been utilized to modify the genome of porcine parthenotes. However, lower biallelic mutation rate and high mosaicism frequency were observed. Here, we aimed to enhance the biallelic mutation rate with reduced mosaicism by optimization of the concentration and injection time of the Cas9/sgRNA mixture in porcine parthenotes. The results showed that the efficient biallelic mutation (93%) and low mosaicism (33%) could be achieved in porcine parthenotes by cytoplasmic injection of Cas9 mRNA/sgRNA (125/12.5 ng/μl) after 8 h of parthenogenetical activation. Thus, our study provides an effective strategy for increasing the biallelic mutation rate and population homogeneity of genetically modified parthenotes, which will strengthen the role of parthenotes in uncovering early embryonic development and assessing the mutation efficiency due to the simplicity and adaptability of CRISPR/Cas9.

27217337	The model opportunistic pathogen Listeria monocytogenes has been the object of extensive research, aiming at understanding its ability to colonize diverse environmental niches and animal hosts. Bacterial transcriptomes in various conditions reflect this efficient adaptability. We review here our current knowledge of the mechanisms allowing L. monocytogenes to respond to environmental changes and trigger pathogenicity, with a special focus on RNA-mediated control of gene expression. We highlight how these studies have brought novel concepts in prokaryotic gene regulation, such as the 'excludon' where the 5'-UTR of a messenger also acts as an antisense regulator of an operon transcribed in opposite orientation, or the notion that riboswitches can regulate non-coding RNAs to integrate complex metabolic stimuli into regulatory networks. Overall, the Listeria model exemplifies that fine RNA tuners act together with master regulatory proteins to orchestrate appropriate transcriptional programmes.	A Lebreton|P Cossart
27216815	Shewanella putrefaciens CN-32 contains a single Type I-Fv CRISPR-Cas system which confers adaptive immunity against bacteriophage infection. Three Cas proteins (Cas6f, Cas7fv, Cas5fv) and mature CRISPR RNAs were shown to be required for the assembly of an interference complex termed Cascade. The Cas protein-CRISPR RNA interaction sites within this complex were identified via mass spectrometry. Additional Cas proteins, commonly described as large and small subunits, that are present in all other investigated Cascade structures, were not detected. We introduced this minimal Type I system in Escherichia coli and show that it provides heterologous protection against lambda phage. The absence of a large subunit suggests that the length of the crRNA might not be fixed and recombinant Cascade complexes with drastically shortened and elongated crRNAs were engineered. Size-exclusion chromatography and small-angle X-ray scattering analyses revealed that the number of Cas7fv backbone subunits is adjusted in these shortened and extended Cascade variants. Larger Cascade complexes can still confer immunity against lambda phage infection in E. coli Minimized Type I CRISPR-Cas systems expand our understanding of the evolution of Cascade assembly and diversity. Their adjustable crRNA length opens the possibility for customizing target DNA specificity.	D Gleditzsch|H Müller-Esparza|P Pausch|K Sharma|S Dwarakanath|H Urlaub|G Bange|L Randau
27211867	Bacteria and archaea employ adaptive immunity against foreign genetic elements using CRISPR-Cas systems. To generate immunological memory, the Cas1-Cas2 protein complex captures 30-40 base pair segments of foreign DNA and catalyzes their integration into the host genome as unique spacer sequences. Although spacers are inserted strictly at the A-T-rich leader end of CRISPR loci in vivo, the molecular mechanism of leader-specific spacer integration remains poorly understood. Here we show that the E. coli integration host factor (IHF) protein is required for spacer acquisition in vivo and for integration into linear DNA in vitro. IHF binds to the leader sequence and induces a sharp DNA bend, allowing the Cas1-Cas2 integrase to catalyze the first integration reaction at the leader-repeat border. Together, these results reveal that Cas1-Cas2-mediated spacer integration requires IHF-induced target DNA bending and explain the elusive role of CRISPR leader sequences during spacer acquisition.

27210050	The CRISPR system holds much promise for successful genome engineering, but therapeutic, industrial, and research applications will place high demand on improving the specificity and efficiency of this tool.

27210040	The genomes are organized into ordered and hierarchical topological structures in interphase nuclei. Within discrete territories of each chromosome, topologically associated domains (TADs) play important roles in various nuclear processes such as gene regulation. Inside TADs separated by relatively constitutive boundaries, distal elements regulate their gene targets through specific chromatin-looping contacts such as long-distance enhancer-promoter interactions. High-throughput sequencing studies have revealed millions of potential regulatory DNA elements, which are much more abundant than the mere ∼20,000 genes they control. The recently emerged CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technologies have enabled efficient and precise genetic and epigenetic manipulations of genomes. The multiplexed and high-throughput CRISPR capabilities facilitate the discovery and dissection of gene regulatory elements. Here, we describe the applications of CRISPR for genome, epigenome, and 3D genome editing, focusing on CRISPR DNA-fragment editing with Cas9 and a pair of sgRNAs to investigate topological folding of chromatin TADs and developmental gene regulation.

27203441	Massive parallel sequencing enables identification of numerous genetic variants in mutant organisms, but determining pathogenicity of any one mutation can be daunting. The most commonly studied preclinical model of retinitis pigmentosa called the "rodless" (rd1) mouse is homozygous for two mutations: a nonsense point mutation (Y347X) and an intronic insertion of a leukemia virus (Xmv-28). Distinguishing which mutation causes retinal degeneration is still under debate nearly a century after the discovery of this model organism. Here, we performed gene editing using the CRISPR/Cas9 system and demonstrated that the Y347X mutation is the causative variant of disease. Genome editing in the first generation produced animals that were mosaic for the corrected allele but still showed neurofunction preservation despite low repair frequencies. Furthermore, second-generation CRISPR-repaired mice showed an even more robust rescue and amelioration of the disease. This predicts excellent outcomes for gene editing in diseased human tissue, as Pde6b, the mutated gene in rd1 mice, has an orthologous intron-exon relationship comparable with the human PDE6B gene.

27197732	The use of DNA sequencing to guide the discovery of natural products has emerged as a new paradigm for revealing chemistries encoded in bacterial genomes. A major obstacle to implementing this approach to natural product discovery is the transcriptional silence of biosynthetic gene clusters under laboratory growth conditions. Here we describe an improved yeast-based promoter engineering platform (mCRISTAR) that combines CRISPR/Cas9 and TAR to enable single-marker multiplexed promoter engineering of large gene clusters. mCRISTAR highlights the first application of the CRISPR/Cas9 system to multiplexed promoter engineering of natural product biosynthetic gene clusters. In this method, CRISPR/Cas9 is used to induce DNA double-strand breaks in promoter regions of biosynthetic gene clusters, and the resulting operon fragments are reassembled by TAR using synthetic gene-cluster-specific promoter cassettes. mCRISTAR uses a CRISPR array to simplify the construction of a CRISPR plasmid for multiplex CRISPR and a single auxotrophic selection to improve the inefficiency of using a CRISPR array for multiplex gene cluster refactoring. mCRISTAR is a simple and generic method for multiplexed replacement of promoters in biosynthetic gene clusters that will facilitate the discovery of natural products from the rapidly growing collection of gene clusters found in microbial genome and metagenome sequencing projects.

27196580	Adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) are a leading candidate bacterial trigger for Crohn's disease (CD). The AIEC pathovar is defined by in vitro cell-line assays examining specific bacteria/cell interactions. No molecular marker exists for their identification. Our aim was to identify a molecular property common to the AIEC phenotype.	41 B2 phylogroup E. coli strains were isolated from 36 Australian subjects: 19 patients with IBD and 17 without. Adherence/invasion assays were conducted using the I-407 epithelial cell line and survival/replication assays using the THP-1 macrophage cell line. Cytokine secretion tumour necrosis factor ((TNF)-α, interleukin (IL) 6, IL-8 and IL-10) was measured using ELISA. The genomes were assembled and annotated, and cluster analysis performed using CD-HIT. The resulting matrices were analysed to identify genes unique/more frequent in AIEC strains compared with non-AIEC strains. Base composition differences and clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeat (CRISPR) analyses were conducted.	Of all B2 phylogroup strains assessed, 79% could survive and replicate in macrophages. Among them, 11/41 strains (5 CD, 2 UCs, 5 non-IBD) also adhere to and invade epithelial cells, a phenotype assigning them to the AIEC pathovar. The AIEC strains were phylogenetically heterogeneous. We did not identify a gene (or nucleic acid base composition differences) common to all, or the majority of, AIEC. Cytokine secretion and CRISPRs were not associated with the AIEC phenotype.	Comparative genomic analysis of AIEC and non-AIEC strains did not identify a molecular property exclusive to the AIEC phenotype. We recommend a broader approach to the identification of the bacteria-host interactions that are important in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease.

27192033	Functional gene analysis by using genome editing techniques is limited only in few model insects. Here, we reported an efficient and heritable gene mutagenesis analysis in an important lepidopteran pest, Spodoptera litura, using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. By using this system, we successfully obtained the homozygous S. litura strain by targeting the pheromone binding protein 3 gene (SlitPBP3), which allowed us to elucidate the role of this gene in the olfaction of the female sex pheromones. By co-injection of Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA into S. litura eggs, highly efficient chimera mutation in SlitPBP3 loci was detected both in injected eggs (39.1%) and in the resulting individual moths (87.5%). We used the mutant moths as parents to obtain the G1 offspring and the homozygous mutant strain in G2. The function of SlitPBP3 was explored by Electroantennogram (EAG) recordings with a homozygous mutant strain. The result showed that the EAG responses were significantly decreased in mutant males than in control males when treated with the major sex pheromone component (Z9,E11-14:Ac) and a minor component (Z9-14:Ac) at higher dosages. The results demonstrate that s SlitPBP3 gene plays a minor role in the perception of the female sex pheromones. Furthermore, our study provides a useful methodology with the CRISPR/Cas9 system for gene in vivo functional study, particular for lepidopteran species in which the RNAi approach is not efficient.

27190232	CRISPR-Cas systems are bacterial adaptive immune systems, each typically composed of a locus of cas genes and a CRISPR array of spacers flanked by repeats. Processed transcripts of CRISPR arrays (crRNAs) play important roles in the interference process mediated by these systems, guiding targeted immunity. Here we developed computational approaches that allow us to characterize the expression of many CRISPRs in their natural environments, using community RNA-seq (metatranscriptomic) data. By exploiting public human gut metatranscriptomic data sets, we studied the expression of 56 repeat-sequence types of CRISPRs, revealing that most CRISPRs are transcribed in one direction (producing crRNAs). In rarer cases, including a type II system associated with Bacteroides fragilis, CRISPRs are transcribed in both directions. Type III CRISPR-Cas systems were found in the microbiomes, but metatranscriptomic reads were barely found for their CRISPRs. We observed individual-level variation of the crRNA transcription, and an even greater transcription of a CRISPR from the antisense strand than the crRNA strand in one sample. The orientations of CRISPR expression implicated by metatranscriptomic data are largely in agreement with prior predictions for CRISPRs, with exceptions. Our study shows the promise of exploiting community RNA-seq data for investigating the transcription of CRISPR-Cas systems.	Y Ye|Q Zhang
27185894	In just 3 years CRISPR genome editing has transformed biology, and its popularity and potency continue to grow. New CRISPR effectors and rules for locating optimum targets continue to be reported, highlighting the need for computational CRISPR targeting tools to compile these rules and facilitate target selection and design. CHOPCHOP is one of the most widely used web tools for CRISPR- and TALEN-based genome editing. Its overarching principle is to provide an intuitive and powerful tool that can serve both novice and experienced users. In this major update we introduce tools for the next generation of CRISPR advances, including Cpf1 and Cas9 nickases. We support a number of new features that improve the targeting power, usability and efficiency of CHOPCHOP. To increase targeting range and specificity we provide support for custom length sgRNAs, and we evaluate the sequence composition of the whole sgRNA and its surrounding region using models compiled from multiple large-scale studies. These and other new features, coupled with an updated interface for increased usability and support for a continually growing list of organisms, maintain CHOPCHOP as one of the leading tools for CRISPR genome editing. CHOPCHOP v2 can be found at http://chopchop.cbu.uib.no.	K Labun|TG Montague|JA Gagnon|SB Thyme|E Valen
27185399	Genome editing exploiting CRISPR/Cas9 has been adopted widely in academia and in the biotechnology industry to manipulate DNA sequences in diverse organisms. Molecular engineering of Cas9 itself and its guide RNA, and the strategies for using them, have increased efficiency, optimized specificity, reduced inappropriate off-target effects, and introduced modifications for performing other functions (transcriptional regulation, high-resolution imaging, protein recruitment, and high-throughput screening). Moreover, Cas9 has the ability to multiplex, i.e., to act at different genomic targets within the same nucleus. Currently, however, introducing concurrent changes at multiple loci involves: (i) identification of appropriate genomic sites, especially the availability of suitable PAM sequences; (ii) the design, construction, and expression of multiple sgRNA directed against those sites; (iii) potential difficulties in altering essential genes; and (iv) lingering concerns about "off-target" effects. We have devised a new approach that circumvents these drawbacks, as we demonstrate here using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae First, any gene(s) of interest are flanked upstream and downstream with a single unique target sequence that does not normally exist in the genome. Thereafter, expression of one sgRNA and cotransformation with appropriate PCR fragments permits concomitant Cas9-mediated alteration of multiple genes (both essential and nonessential). The system we developed also allows for maintenance of the integrated, inducible Cas9-expression cassette or its simultaneous scarless excision. Our scheme-dubbed mCAL for " M: ultiplexing of C: as9 at A: rtificial L: oci"-can be applied to any organism in which the CRISPR/Cas9 methodology is currently being utilized. In principle, it can be applied to install synthetic sequences into the genome, to generate genomic libraries, and to program strains or cell lines so that they can be conveniently (and repeatedly) manipulated at multiple loci with extremely high efficiency.

27184979	CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) RNAs provide the specificity for noncoding RNA-guided adaptive immune defence systems in prokaryotes. CRISPR arrays consist of repeat sequences separated by specific spacer sequences. CRISPR arrays have previously been identified in a large proportion of prokaryotic genomes. However, currently available detection algorithms do not utilise recently discovered features regarding CRISPR loci.	We have developed a new approach to automatically detect, predict and interactively refine CRISPR arrays. It is available as a web program and command line from bioanalysis.otago.ac.nz/CRISPRDetect. CRISPRDetect discovers putative arrays, extends the array by detecting additional variant repeats, corrects the direction of arrays, refines the repeat/spacer boundaries, and annotates different types of sequence variations (e.g. insertion/deletion) in near identical repeats. Due to these features, CRISPRDetect has significant advantages when compared to existing identification tools. As well as further support for small medium and large repeats, CRISPRDetect identified a class of arrays with 'extra-large' repeats in bacteria (repeats 44-50 nt). The CRISPRDetect output is integrated with other analysis tools. Notably, the predicted spacers can be directly utilised by CRISPRTarget to predict targets.	CRISPRDetect enables more accurate detection of arrays and spacers and its gff output is suitable for inclusion in genome annotation pipelines and visualisation. It has been used to analyse all complete bacterial and archaeal reference genomes.	A Biswas|RH Staals|SE Morales|PC Fineran|CM Brown
27178736	The engineered CRISPR/Cas9 technology has developed as the most efficient and broadly used genome editing tool. However, simultaneously targeting multiple genes (or genomic loci) in the same individual cells using CRISPR/Cas9 remain one technical challenge. In this article, we have developed a Golden Gate Assembly method for the generation of CRISPR gRNA expression arrays, thus enabling simultaneous gene targeting. Using this method, the generation of CRISPR gRNA expression array can be accomplished in 2 weeks, and contains up to 30 gRNA expression cassettes. We demonstrated in the study that simultaneously targeting 10 genomic loci or simultaneously inhibition of multiple endogenous genes could be achieved using the multiplexed gRNA expression array vector in human cells. The complete set of plasmids is available through the non-profit plasmid repository Addgene.	J Vad-Nielsen|L Lin|L Bolund|AL Nielsen|Y Luo
27175020	Targeted gene mutation in the mouse is a primary strategy to understand gene function and relation to phenotype. The Knockout Mouse Project (KOMP) had an initial goal to develop a public resource of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cell clones that carry null mutations in all genes. Indeed, many useful novel mouse models have been generated from publically accessible targeted mouse ES cell lines. However, there are limitations, including incorrect targeting or cassette structure, and difficulties with germline transmission of the allele from chimeric mice. In our experience, using a small sample of targeted ES cell clones, we were successful ∼50% of the time in generating germline transmission of a correctly targeted allele. With the advent of CRISPR/Cas9 as a mouse genome modification tool, we assessed the efficiency of creating a conditional targeted allele in one gene, dedicator of cytokinesis 7 (Dock7), for which we were unsuccessful in generating a null allele using a KOMP targeted ES cell clone. The strategy was to insert loxP sites to flank either exons 3 and 4, or exons 3 through 7. By coinjecting Cas9 mRNA, validated sgRNAs, and oligonucleotide donors into fertilized eggs from C57BL/6J mice, we obtained a variety of alleles, including mice homozygous for the null alleles mediated by nonhomologous end joining, alleles with one of the two desired loxP sites, and correctly targeted alleles with both loxP sites. We also found frequent mutations in the inserted loxP sequence, which is partly attributable to the heterogeneity in the original oligonucleotide preparation.

27167304	Targeted DNA mutations generated by vectors with clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 technology have proven useful for functional genomics studies. While most cloning strategies are simple to perform, they generally use multiple steps and can require several days to generate the ultimate constructs. The method presented here is based on DNA assembly and can produce fully functional CRISPR vectors in a single cloning reaction. Vector construction can also be pooled, further increasing the efficiency and utility of the process. A modification of the method is used to create CRISPR vectors with multiple gene targets. CRISPR vectors are then transformed into tomato hairy roots to generate transgenic materials with targeted DNA modifications. Hairy roots are a useful system for testing vector functionality as they are technically simple to generate and amenable to large-scale production. The methods presented here will have wide application as they can be used to generate a variety of CRISPR vectors and be used in a wide range of plant species.	TB Jacobs|GB Martin
27166368	The CRISPR/Cas technology is enabling targeted genome editing in multiple organisms with unprecedented accuracy and specificity by using RNA-guided nucleases. A critical point when planning a CRISPR/Cas experiment is the design of the guide RNA (gRNA), which directs the nuclease and associated machinery to the desired genomic location. This gRNA has to fulfil the requirements of the nuclease and lack homology with other genome sites that could lead to off-target effects. Here we introduce the Breaking-Cas system for the design of gRNAs for CRISPR/Cas experiments, including those based in the Cas9 nuclease as well as others recently introduced. The server has unique features not available in other tools, including the possibility of using all eukaryotic genomes available in ENSEMBL (currently around 700), placing variable PAM sequences at 5' or 3' and setting the guide RNA length and the scores per nucleotides. It can be freely accessed at: http://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/breakingcas, and the code is available upon request.	JC Oliveros|M Franch|D Tabas-Madrid|D San-León|L Montoliu|P Cubas|F Pazos
27165349	Animal models of tumor initiation and tumor progression are essential components toward understanding cancer and designing/validating future therapies. Zebrafish is a powerful model for studying tumorigenesis and has been successfully exploited in drug discovery. According to the zebrafish reference genome, 82 % of disease-associated genes in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database have clear zebrafish orthologues. Using a variety of large-scale random mutagenesis methods developed to date, zebrafish can provide a unique opportunity to identify gene mutations that may be associated with cancer predisposition. On the other hand, newer technologies enabling targeted mutagenesis can facilitate reverse cancer genetic studies and open the door for complex genetic analysis of tumorigenesis. In this chapter, we will describe the various technologies for conducting genome editing in zebrafish with special emphasis on the approaches to inactivate genes.	JM Parant|JR Yeh
27165348	Here we describe the conditional zebrafish cancer toolbox, which allows for fine control of the expression of oncogenes or downregulation of tumor suppressors at the spatial and temporal level. Methods such as the Gal4/UAS or the Cre/lox systems paved the way to the development of elegant tumor models, which are now being used to study cancer cell biology, clonal evolution, identification of cancer stem cells and anti-cancer drug screening. Combination of these tools, as well as novel developments such as the promising genome editing system through CRISPR/Cas9 and clever application of light reactive proteins will enable the development of even more sophisticated zebrafish cancer models. Here, we introduce this growing toolbox of conditional transgenic approaches, discuss its current application in zebrafish cancer models and provide an outlook on future perspectives.

27160574	The extremely halophilic archaeon Halobacterium noricense is a member of the genus Halobacterium. Strain CBA1132 (= KCCM 43183, JCM 31150) was isolated from solar salt. The genome of strain CBA1132 assembled with 4 contigs, including three rRNA genes, 44 tRNA genes, and 3,208 open reading frames. Strain CBA1132 had nine putative CRISPRs and the genome contained genes encoding metal resistance determinants: copper-translocating P-type ATPase (CtpA), arsenical pump-driving ATPase (ArsA), arsenate reductase (ArsC), and arsenical resistance operon repressor (ArsR). Strain CBA1132 was related to Halobacterium noricense, with 99.2% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity. Based on the comparative genomic analysis, strain CBA1132 has distinctly evolved; moreover, essential genes related to nitrogen metabolism were only detected in the genome of strain CBA1132 among the reported genomes in the genus Halobacterium. This genome sequence of Halobacterium noricense CBA1132 may be of use in future molecular biological studies.

27160350	The recent Zika virus outbreak highlights the need for low-cost diagnostics that can be rapidly developed for distribution and use in pandemic regions. Here, we report a pipeline for the rapid design, assembly, and validation of cell-free, paper-based sensors for the detection of the Zika virus RNA genome. By linking isothermal RNA amplification to toehold switch RNA sensors, we detect clinically relevant concentrations of Zika virus sequences and demonstrate specificity against closely related Dengue virus sequences. When coupled with a novel CRISPR/Cas9-based module, our sensors can discriminate between viral strains with single-base resolution. We successfully demonstrate a simple, field-ready sample-processing workflow and detect Zika virus from the plasma of a viremic macaque. Our freeze-dried biomolecular platform resolves important practical limitations to the deployment of molecular diagnostics in the field and demonstrates how synthetic biology can be used to develop diagnostic tools for confronting global health crises.

27159405	The CEN/ARS-based low-copy plasmids and 2 μ-based high-copy plasmids have been broadly used for both fundamental studies and practical applications in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, the relative low copy numbers and narrow dynamic range limit their applications in many cases. In this study, the expression level of the selection marker proteins was engineered to increase the plasmid copy numbers. A series of plasmids with step-wise increased copy numbers were constructed. The copy number of the plasmids with engineered dominant markers (5-100 copies per cell) showed a positive correlation with the concentration of antibiotics supplemented to the growth media. Based on this finding, we developed a simple yet highly efficient strategy, named Pathway Optimization by Tuning Antibiotic Concentrations (POTAC) to rapidly balance the flux of multi-gene pathways at the DNA level in S. cerevisiae. As proof of concept, POTAC was used to optimize the lycopene and n-butanol biosynthetic pathways, increasing the production of lycopene and n-butanol by 10- and 100-fold, respectively. Additionally, multiplex genome integration with controllable copy numbers was attempted by combining the engineered dominant markers with the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Biotechnol.

27159373	We compared the ability of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and CRISPR/Cas9 screens to identify essential genes in the human chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line K562. We found that the precision of the two libraries in detecting essential genes was similar and that combining data from both screens improved performance. Notably, results from the two screens showed little correlation, which can be partially explained by the identification of distinct essential biological processes with each technology.

27159230	Targeted gene integration into site-specific loci can be achieved in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells via CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology and the homology-directed repair (HDR) pathway. The low efficiency of HDR often requires antibiotic selection, which limits targeted integration of multiple genes at multiple sites. To improve HDR-mediated targeted integration, while avoiding the use of selection markers, chemical treatment for increased HDR, and fluorescent enrichment of genome-edited cells was assessed in CHO cells. Chemical treatment did not improve HDR-mediated targeted integration. In contrast, fluorescent markers in Cas9 and donor constructs enable FACS enrichment, resulting in a threefold increase in the number of cells with HDR-mediated genome editing. Combined with this enrichment method, large transgenes encoding model proteins (including an antibody) were successfully targeted integrated. This approach provides a simple and fast strategy for targeted generation of stable CHO production cell lines in a rational way. Biotechnol.

27145877	The three-dimensional organization of the genome plays important roles in regulating the functional output of the genome and even in the maintenance of epigenetic inheritance and genome stability. Here, we review and compare a number of newly developed methods-especially those that utilize the CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat)-Cas9 (CRISPR-associated protein 9) system-that enable the direct visualization of specific, endogenous DNA sequences in living cells. We also discuss the practical considerations in implementing the CRISPR imaging technique to achieve sufficient signal-to-background levels, high specificity, and high labeling efficiency. These DNA labeling methods enable tracking of the copy number, localization, and movement of genomic elements, and we discuss the potential applications of these methods in understanding the searching and targeting mechanism of the Cas9-sgRNA complex, investigating chromosome organization, and visualizing genome instability and rearrangement.

27145843	The Cas9 protein (CRISPR-associated protein 9), derived from type II CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) bacterial immune systems, is emerging as a powerful tool for engineering the genome in diverse organisms. As an RNA-guided DNA endonuclease, Cas9 can be easily programmed to target new sites by altering its guide RNA sequence, and its development as a tool has made sequence-specific gene editing several magnitudes easier. The nuclease-deactivated form of Cas9 further provides a versatile RNA-guided DNA-targeting platform for regulating and imaging the genome, as well as for rewriting the epigenetic status, all in a sequence-specific manner. With all of these advances, we have just begun to explore the possible applications of Cas9 in biomedical research and therapeutics. In this review, we describe the current models of Cas9 function and the structural and biochemical studies that support it. We focus on the applications of Cas9 for genome editing, regulation, and imaging, discuss other possible applications and some technical considerations, and highlight the many advantages that CRISPR/Cas9 technology offers.

27143383	The adaptive immune system of prokaryotes, called CRISPR-Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and CRISPR-associated genes), results in specific cleavage of invading nucleic acid sequences recognized by the cell's "memory" of past encounters. Here, we exploited the properties of native CRISPR-Cas systems to program the natural "memorization" process, efficiently generating immunity not only to a bacteriophage or plasmid but to any specifically chosen DNA sequence.	CRISPR-Cas systems have entered the public consciousness as genome editing tools due to their readily programmable nature. In industrial settings, natural CRISPR-Cas immunity is already exploited to generate strains resistant to potentially disruptive viruses. However, the natural process by which bacteria acquire new target specificities (adaptation) is difficult to study and manipulate. The target against which immunity is conferred is selected stochastically. By biasing the immunization process, we offer a means to generate customized immunity, as well as provide a new tool to study adaptation.	AP Hynes|SJ Labrie|S Moineau

27136077	The clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated protein Cas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes is an RNA-guided DNA endonuclease with widespread utility for genome modification. However, the structural constraints limiting the engineering of Cas9 have not been determined. Here we experimentally profile Cas9 using randomized insertional mutagenesis and delineate hotspots in the structure capable of tolerating insertions of a PDZ domain without disruption of the enzyme's binding and cleavage functions. Orthogonal domains or combinations of domains can be inserted into the identified sites with minimal functional consequence. To illustrate the utility of the identified sites, we construct an allosterically regulated Cas9 by insertion of the estrogen receptor-α ligand-binding domain. This protein showed robust, ligand-dependent activation in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, establishing a versatile one-component system for inducible and reversible Cas9 activation. Thus, domain insertion profiling facilitates the rapid generation of new Cas9 functionalities and provides useful data for future engineering of Cas9.

27116122	Rice blast is one of the most destructive diseases affecting rice worldwide. The adoption of host resistance has proven to be the most economical and effective approach to control rice blast. In recent years, sequence-specific nucleases (SSNs) have been demonstrated to be powerful tools for the improvement of crops via gene-specific genome editing, and CRISPR/Cas9 is thought to be the most effective SSN. Here, we report the improvement of rice blast resistance by engineering a CRISPR/Cas9 SSN (C-ERF922) targeting the OsERF922 gene in rice. Twenty-one C-ERF922-induced mutant plants (42.0%) were identified from 50 T0 transgenic plants. Sanger sequencing revealed that these plants harbored various insertion or deletion (InDel) mutations at the target site. We showed that all of the C-ERF922-induced allele mutations were transmitted to subsequent generations. Mutant plants harboring the desired gene modification but not containing the transferred DNA were obtained by segregation in the T1 and T2 generations. Six T2 homozygous mutant lines were further examined for a blast resistance phenotype and agronomic traits, such as plant height, flag leaf length and width, number of productive panicles, panicle length, number of grains per panicle, seed setting percentage and thousand seed weight. The results revealed that the number of blast lesions formed following pathogen infection was significantly decreased in all 6 mutant lines compared with wild-type plants at both the seedling and tillering stages. Furthermore, there were no significant differences between any of the 6 T2 mutant lines and the wild-type plants with regard to the agronomic traits tested. We also simultaneously targeted multiple sites within OsERF922 by using Cas9/Multi-target-sgRNAs (C-ERF922S1S2 and C-ERF922S1S2S3) to obtain plants harboring mutations at two or three sites. Our results indicate that gene modification via CRISPR/Cas9 is a useful approach for enhancing blast resistance in rice.	F Wang|C Wang|P Liu|C Lei|W Hao|Y Gao|YG Liu|K Zhao
27114166	The increasing burden of the world population on agriculture requires the development of more robust crops. Dissecting the basic biology that underlies plant development and stress responses will inform the design of better crops. One powerful tool for studying plants at the molecular level is the RNA-programmed genome editing system composed of a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-encoded guide RNA and the nuclease Cas9. Here, some of the recent advances in CRISPR/Cas9 technology that have profound implications for improving the study of plant biology are described.

We find that the CRISPR technology performed best, with low noise, minimal off-target effects and consistent activity across reagents.

27102963	Previous efforts to target the mouse genome for the addition, subtraction, or substitution of biologically informative sequences required complex vector design and a series of arduous steps only a handful of laboratories could master. The facile and inexpensive clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) method has now superseded traditional means of genome modification such that virtually any laboratory can quickly assemble reagents for developing new mouse models for cardiovascular research. Here, we briefly review the history of CRISPR in prokaryotes, highlighting major discoveries leading to its formulation for genome modification in the animal kingdom. Core components of CRISPR technology are reviewed and updated. Practical pointers for 2-component and 3-component CRISPR editing are summarized with many applications in mice including frameshift mutations, deletion of enhancers and noncoding genes, nucleotide substitution of protein-coding and gene regulatory sequences, incorporation of loxP sites for conditional gene inactivation, and epitope tag integration. Genotyping strategies are presented and topics of genetic mosaicism and inadvertent targeting discussed. Finally, clinical applications and ethical considerations are addressed as the biomedical community eagerly embraces this astonishing innovation in genome editing to tackle previously intractable questions.

27100999	Cell membranes contain hundreds to thousands of individual lipid species that are of structural importance but also specifically interact with proteins. Due to their highly controlled synthesis and role in signaling events sphingolipids are an intensely studied class of lipids. In order to investigate their metabolism and to study proteins interacting with sphingolipids, metabolic labeling based on photoactivatable sphingoid bases is the most straightforward approach. In order to monitor protein-lipid-crosslink products, sphingosine derivatives containing a reporter moiety, such as a radiolabel or a clickable group, are used. In normal cells, degradation of sphingoid bases via action of the checkpoint enzyme sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase occurs at position C2-C3 of the sphingoid base and channels the resulting hexadecenal into the glycerolipid biosynthesis pathway. In case the functionalized sphingosine looses the reporter moiety during its degradation, specificity towards sphingolipid labeling is maintained. In case degradation of a sphingosine derivative does not remove either the photoactivatable or reporter group from the resulting hexadecenal, specificity towards sphingolipid labeling can be achieved by blocking sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase activity and thus preventing sphingosine derivatives to be channeled into the sphingolipid-to-glycerolipid metabolic pathway. Here we report an approach using clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated nuclease Cas9 to create a sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase (SGPL1) HeLa knockout cell line to disrupt the sphingolipid-to-glycerolipid metabolic pathway. We found that the lipid and protein compositions as well as sphingolipid metabolism of SGPL1 knock-out HeLa cells only show little adaptations, which validates these cells as model systems to study transient protein-sphingolipid interactions.

27098036	The Sulfolobales host a unique family of crenarchaeal conjugative plasmids some of which undergo complex rearrangements intracellularly. Here we examined the conjugation cycle of pKEF9 in the recipient strain Sulfolobus islandicus REY15A. The plasmid conjugated and replicated rapidly generating high average copy numbers which led to strong growth retardation that was coincident with activation of CRISPR-Cas adaptation. Simultaneously, intracellular DNA was extensively degraded and this also occurred in a conjugated Δcas6 mutant lacking a CRISPR-Cas immune response. Furthermore, the integrated forms of pKEF9 in the donor Sulfolobus solfataricus P1 and recipient host were specifically corrupted by transposable orfB elements, indicative of a dual mechanism for inactivating free and integrated forms of the plasmid. In addition, the CRISPR locus of pKEF9 was progressively deleted when conjugated into the recipient strain. Factors influencing activation of CRISPR-Cas adaptation in the recipient strain are considered, including the first evidence for a possible priming effect in Sulfolobus The 3-Mbp genome sequence of the donor P1 strain is presented.

27096365	Current genome-editing technologies introduce double-stranded (ds) DNA breaks at a target locus as the first step to gene correction. Although most genetic diseases arise from point mutations, current approaches to point mutation correction are inefficient and typically induce an abundance of random insertions and deletions (indels) at the target locus resulting from the cellular response to dsDNA breaks. Here we report the development of 'base editing', a new approach to genome editing that enables the direct, irreversible conversion of one target DNA base into another in a programmable manner, without requiring dsDNA backbone cleavage or a donor template. We engineered fusions of CRISPR/Cas9 and a cytidine deaminase enzyme that retain the ability to be programmed with a guide RNA, do not induce dsDNA breaks, and mediate the direct conversion of cytidine to uridine, thereby effecting a C→T (or G→A) substitution. The resulting 'base editors' convert cytidines within a window of approximately five nucleotides, and can efficiently correct a variety of point mutations relevant to human disease. In four transformed human and murine cell lines, second- and third-generation base editors that fuse uracil glycosylase inhibitor, and that use a Cas9 nickase targeting the non-edited strand, manipulate the cellular DNA repair response to favour desired base-editing outcomes, resulting in permanent correction of ~15-75% of total cellular DNA with minimal (typically ≤1%) indel formation. Base editing expands the scope and efficiency of genome editing of point mutations.	AC Komor|YB Kim|MS Packer|JA Zuris|DR Liu
27096363	The CRISPR-Cas systems, as exemplified by CRISPR-Cas9, are RNA-guided adaptive immune systems used by bacteria and archaea to defend against viral infection. The CRISPR-Cpf1 system, a new class 2 CRISPR-Cas system, mediates robust DNA interference in human cells. Although functionally conserved, Cpf1 and Cas9 differ in many aspects including their guide RNAs and substrate specificity. Here we report the 2.38 Å crystal structure of the CRISPR RNA (crRNA)-bound Lachnospiraceae bacterium ND2006 Cpf1 (LbCpf1). LbCpf1 has a triangle-shaped architecture with a large positively charged channel at the centre. Recognized by the oligonucleotide-binding domain of LbCpf1, the crRNA adopts a highly distorted conformation stabilized by extensive intramolecular interactions and the (Mg(H2O)6)(2+) ion. The oligonucleotide-binding domain also harbours a looped-out helical domain that is important for LbCpf1 substrate binding. Binding of crRNA or crRNA lacking the guide sequence induces marked conformational changes but no oligomerization of LbCpf1. Our study reveals the crRNA recognition mechanism and provides insight into crRNA-guided substrate binding of LbCpf1, establishing a framework for engineering LbCpf1 to improve its efficiency and specificity for genome editing.

27096362	CRISPR-Cas systems that provide defence against mobile genetic elements in bacteria and archaea have evolved a variety of mechanisms to target and cleave RNA or DNA. The well-studied types I, II and III utilize a set of distinct CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins for production of mature CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) and interference with invading nucleic acids. In types I and III, Cas6 or Cas5d cleaves precursor crRNA (pre-crRNA) and the mature crRNAs then guide a complex of Cas proteins (Cascade-Cas3, type I; Csm or Cmr, type III) to target and cleave invading DNA or RNA. In type II systems, RNase III cleaves pre-crRNA base-paired with trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) in the presence of Cas9 (refs 13, 14). The mature tracrRNA-crRNA duplex then guides Cas9 to cleave target DNA. Here, we demonstrate a novel mechanism in CRISPR-Cas immunity. We show that type V-A Cpf1 from Francisella novicida is a dual-nuclease that is specific to crRNA biogenesis and target DNA interference. Cpf1 cleaves pre-crRNA upstream of a hairpin structure formed within the CRISPR repeats and thereby generates intermediate crRNAs that are processed further, leading to mature crRNAs. After recognition of a 5'-YTN-3' protospacer adjacent motif on the non-target DNA strand and subsequent probing for an eight-nucleotide seed sequence, Cpf1, guided by the single mature repeat-spacer crRNA, introduces double-stranded breaks in the target DNA to generate a 5' overhang. The RNase and DNase activities of Cpf1 require sequence- and structure-specific binding to the hairpin of crRNA repeats. Cpf1 uses distinct active domains for both nuclease reactions and cleaves nucleic acids in the presence of magnesium or calcium. This study uncovers a new family of enzymes with specific dual endoribonuclease and endonuclease activities, and demonstrates that type V-A constitutes the most minimalistic of the CRISPR-Cas systems so far described.

Here we describe CRISPRainbow, a system for labeling DNA in living cells based on nuclease-dead (d) Cas9 combined with engineered single guide RNA (sgRNA) scaffolds that bind sets of fluorescent proteins. We demonstrate simultaneous imaging of up to six chromosomal loci in individual live cells and document large differences in the dynamic properties of different chromosomal loci.

27085805	Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPRs) acquire new spacers to generate adaptive immunity in prokaryotes. During spacer integration, the leader-preceded repeat is always accurately duplicated, leading to speculations of a repeat-length ruler. Here in Haloarcula hispanica, we demonstrate that the accurate duplication of its 30-bp repeat requires two conserved mid-repeat motifs, AACCC and GTGGG. The AACCC motif was essential and needed to be ∼10 bp downstream from the leader-repeat junction site, where duplication consistently started. Interestingly, repeat duplication terminated sequence-independently and usually with a specific distance from the GTGGG motif, which seemingly served as an anchor site for a molecular ruler. Accordingly, altering the spacing between the two motifs led to an aberrant duplication size (29, 31, 32 or 33 bp). We propose the adaptation complex may recognize these mid-repeat elements to enable measuring the repeat DNA for spacer integration.	R Wang|M Li|L Gong|S Hu|H Xiang
27079979	Robust gene circuit construction requires use of promoters exhibiting low crosstalk. Orthogonal promoters have been engineered utilizing an assortment of natural and synthetic transcription factors, but design of large orthogonal promoter-repressor sets is complicated, labor-intensive, and often results in unanticipated crosstalk. The specificity and ease of targeting the RNA-guided DNA-binding protein dCas9 to any 20 bp user-defined DNA sequence makes it a promising candidate for orthogonal promoter regulation. Here, we rapidly construct orthogonal variants of the classic T7-lac promoter using site-directed mutagenesis, generating a panel of inducible hybrid promoters regulated by both LacI and dCas9. Remarkably, orthogonality is mediated by only two to three nucleotide mismatches in a narrow window of the RNA:DNA hybrid, neighboring the protospacer adjacent motif. We demonstrate that, contrary to many reports, one PAM-proximal mismatch is insufficient to abolish dCas9-mediated repression, and we show for the first time that mismatch tolerance is a function of target copy number. Finally, these promoters were incorporated into the branched violacein biosynthetic pathway as dCas9-dependent switches capable of throttling and selectively redirecting carbon flux in Escherichia coli We anticipate this strategy is relevant for any promoter and will be adopted for many applications at the interface of synthetic biology and metabolic engineering.

27078492	Enhancers control cell identity by regulating tissue-specific gene expression in a position and orientation independent manner. These enhancers are often located distally from the regulated gene in intergenic regions or even within the body of another gene. The position independent nature of enhancer activity makes it difficult to match enhancers with the genes they regulate. Deletion of an enhancer region provides direct evidence for enhancer activity and is the gold standard to reveal an enhancer's role in endogenous gene transcription. Conventional homologous recombination based deletion methods have been surpassed by recent advances in genome editing technology which enable rapid and precisely located changes to the genomes of numerous model organisms. CRISPR/Cas9 mediated genome editing can be used to manipulate the genome in many cell types and organisms rapidly and cost effectively, due to the ease with which Cas9 can be targeted to the genome by a guide RNA from a bespoke expression plasmid. Homozygous deletion of essential gene regulatory elements might lead to lethality or alter cellular phenotype whereas monoallelic deletion of transcriptional enhancers allows for the study of cis-regulation of gene expression without this confounding issue. Presented here is a protocol for CRISPR/Cas9 mediated deletion in F1 mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells (Mus musculus(129) x Mus castaneus). Monoallelic deletion, screening and expression analysis is facilitated by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) between the two alleles which occur on average every 125 bp in these cells.

27075976	Pluripotent stem cells exhibit cell cycle-regulated heterogeneity for trimethylation of histone-3 on lysine-4 (H3K4me3) on developmental gene promoters containing bivalent epigenetic domains. The heterogeneity of H3K4me3 can be attributed to Cyclin-dependent kinase-2 (CDK2) phosphorylation and activation of the histone methyltransferase, MLL2 (KMT2B), during late-G1. The deposition of H3K4me3 on developmental promoters in late-G1 establishes a permissive chromatin architecture that enables signaling cues to promote differentiation from the G1 phase. These data suggest that the inhibition of MLL2 phosphorylation and activation will prevent the initiation of differentiation. Here, we describe a method to seamlessly modify a putative CDK2 phosphorylation site on MLL2 to restrict its phosphorylation and activation. Specifically, by utilizing dimeric CRISPR RNA-guided nucleases, RFNs (commercially known as the NextGEN™ CRISPR), in combination with an excision-only piggyBac™ transposase, we demonstrate how to generate a point mutation of threonine-542, a predicted site to prevent MLL2 activation. This gene editing method enables the use of both positive and negative selection, and allows for subsequent removal of the donor cassette without leaving behind any unwanted DNA sequences or modifications. This seamless "donor-excision" approach provides clear advantages over using single stranded oligo-deoxynucleotides (ssODN) as donors to create point mutations, as the use of ssODN necessitate additional mutations in the donor PAM sequence, along with extensive cloning efforts. The method described here therefore provides the highest targeting efficiency with the lowest "off-target" mutation rates possible, while removing the labor-intensive efforts associated with screening thousands of clones. In sum, this chapter describes how seamless gene editing may be utilized to examine stem cell heterogeneity of epigenetic marks, but is also widely applicable for performing precise genetic manipulations in numerous other cell types.

27073104	Emerging resistance to first-line antimalarial combination therapies threatens malaria treatment and the global elimination campaign. Improved therapeutic strategies are required to protect existing drugs and enhance treatment efficacy. We report that the piperazine-containing compound ACT-451840 exhibits single-digit nanomolar inhibition of the Plasmodium falciparum asexual blood stages and transmissible gametocyte forms. Genome sequence analyses of in vitro-derived ACT-451840-resistant parasites revealed single nucleotide polymorphisms in pfmdr1, which encodes a digestive vacuole membrane-bound ATP-binding cassette transporter known to alter P. falciparum susceptibility to multiple first-line antimalarials. CRISPR-Cas9 based gene editing confirmed that PfMDR1 point mutations mediated ACT-451840 resistance. Resistant parasites demonstrated increased susceptibility to the clinical drugs lumefantrine, mefloquine, quinine and amodiaquine. Stage V gametocytes harboring Cas9-introduced pfmdr1 mutations also acquired ACT-451840 resistance. These findings reveal that PfMDR1 mutations can impart resistance to compounds active against asexual blood stages and mature gametocytes. Exploiting PfMDR1 resistance mechanisms provides new opportunities for developing disease-relieving and transmission-blocking antimalarials.

27072506	Methods for importing heterologous genes into genetically tractable hosts are among the most desired tools of synthetic biology. Easy plug-and-play construction methods to rapidly test genes and pathways stably in the host genome would expedite synthetic biology and metabolic engineering applications. Here, we describe a CRISPR-based strategy that allows highly efficient, single step integration of large pathways in Escherichia coli. This strategy allows high efficiency integration in a broad range of homology arm sizes and genomic positions, with efficiencies ranging from 70 to 100% in 7 distinct loci. To demonstrate the large size capability, we integrated a 10 kb construct to implement isobutanol production in a single day. The ability to efficiently integrate entire metabolic pathways in a rapid and markerless manner will facilitate testing and engineering of novel pathways using the E. coli genome as a stable testing platform.

27071075	Flavobacterium psychrophilum is a fish pathogen in salmonid aquaculture worldwide that causes cold water disease (CWD) and rainbow trout fry syndrome (RTFS). Comparative genome analyses of 11 F. psychrophilum isolates representing temporally and geographically distant populations were used to describe the F. psychrophilum pan-genome and to examine virulence factors, prophages, CRISPR arrays, and genomic islands present in the genomes. Analysis of the genomic DNA sequences were complemented with selected phenotypic characteristics of the strains. The pan genome analysis showed that F. psychrophilum could hold at least 3373 genes, while the core genome contained 1743 genes. On average, 67 new genes were detected for every new genome added to the analysis, indicating that F. psychrophilum possesses an open pan genome. The putative virulence factors were equally distributed among isolates, independent of geographic location, year of isolation and source of isolates. Only one prophage-related sequence was found which corresponded to the previously described prophage 6H, and appeared in 5 out of 11 isolates. CRISPR array analysis revealed two different loci with dissimilar spacer content, which only matched one sequence in the database, the temperate bacteriophage 6H. Genomic Islands (GIs) were identified in F. psychrophilum isolates 950106-1/1 and CSF 259-93, associated with toxins and antibiotic resistance. Finally, phenotypic characterization revealed a high degree of similarity among the strains with respect to biofilm formation and secretion of extracellular enzymes. Global scale dispersion of virulence factors in the genomes and the abilities for biofilm formation, hemolytic activity and secretion of extracellular enzymes among the strains suggested that F. psychrophilum isolates have a similar mode of action on adhesion, colonization and destruction of fish tissues across large spatial and temporal scales of occurrence. Overall, the genomic characterization and phenotypic properties may provide new insights to the mechanisms of pathogenicity in F. psychrophilum.

27066838	Staphylococcus aureus causes a wide variety of infections and antibiotic resistant strains are a major problem in hospitals. One of the best studied virulence factors of S. aureus is the pore-forming toxin alpha hemolysin (αHL) whose mechanism of action is incompletely understood. We performed a genome-wide loss-of-function screen using CRISPR/Cas9 technology to identify host targets required for αHL susceptibility in human myeloid cells. We found gRNAs for ten genes enriched after intoxication with αHL and focused on the top five hits. Besides a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 10 (ADAM10), the host receptor for αHL, we identified three proteins, Sys1 golgi trafficking protein (SYS1), ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARFRP1), and tetraspanin-14 (TSPAN14) which regulate the presentation of ADAM10 on the plasma membrane post-translationally. Interestingly, we also showed that cells lacking sphingomyelin synthase 1 (SGMS1) resist αHL intoxication, but have only a slightly reduced ADAM10 surface expression. SGMS1 regulates lipid raft formation, suggesting that αHL requires these membrane microdomains for attachment and cytotoxicity.	S Virreira Winter|A Zychlinsky|BW Bardoel

27061764	Custom-designed nuclease technologies such as the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-associated (Cas) system provide attractive genome editing tools for insect functional genetics. The targeted gene mutagenesis mediated by the CRISPR/Cas9 system has been achieved in several insect orders including Diptera, Lepidoptera and Coleoptera. However, little success has been reported in agricultural pests due to the lack of genomic information and embryonic microinjection techniques in these insect species. Here we report that the CRISPR/Cas9 system induced efficient gene mutagenesis in an important Lepidopteran pest Spodoptera litura. We targeted the S. litura Abdominal-A (Slabd-A) gene which is an important embryonic development gene and plays a significant role in determining the identities of the abdominal segments of insects. Direct injection of Cas9 messenger RNA and Slabd-A-specific single guide RNA (sgRNA) into S. litura embryos successfully induced the typical abd-A deficient phenotype, which shows anomalous segmentation and ectopic pigmentation during the larval stage. A polymerase chain reaction-based analysis revealed that the Cas9/sgRNA complex effectively induced a targeted mutagenesis in S. litura. These results demonstrate that the CRISPR/Cas9 system is a powerful tool for genome manipulation in Lepidopteran pests such as S. litura.	HL Bi|J Xu|AJ Tan|YP Huang

27058690	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) are structured regions in bacterial and archaeal genomes, which are part of an adaptive immune system against phages. CRISPRs are important for many microbial studies and are playing an essential role in current gene editing techniques. As such, they attract substantial research interest. The exponential growth in the amount of bacterial sequence data in recent years enables the exploration of CRISPR loci in more and more species. Most of the automated tools that detect CRISPR loci rely on fully assembled genomes. However, many assemblers do not handle repetitive regions successfully. The first tool to work directly on raw sequence data is Crass, which requires reads that are long enough to contain two copies of the same repeat. We present a method to identify CRISPR repeats from raw sequence data of short reads. The algorithm is based on an observation differentiating CRISPR repeats from other types of repeats, and it involves a series of partial constructions of the overlap graph. This enables us to avoid many of the difficulties that assemblers face, as we merely aim to identify the repeats that belong to CRISPR loci. A preliminary implementation of the algorithm shows good results and detects CRISPR repeats in cases where other existing tools fail to do so.	I Ben-Bassat|B Chor
27052801	Advances in the field of epigenetics have allowed the design of new therapeutic strategies to address complex diseases such as type 1 diabetes (T1D). Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-on is a novel and powerful RNA-guided transcriptional activator system that can turn on specific gene expression; however, it remains unclear whether this system can be widely used or whether its use will be restricted depending on cell types, methylation promoter statuses or the capacity to modulate chromatin state. Our results revealed that the CRISPR-on system fused with transcriptional activators (dCas9-VP160) activated endogenous human INS, which is a silenced gene with a fully methylated promoter. Similarly, we observed a synergistic effect on gene activation when multiple single guide RNAs were used, and the transcriptional activation was maintained until day 21. Regarding the epigenetic profile, the targeted promoter gene did not exhibit alteration in its methylation status but rather exhibited altered levels of H3K9ac following treatment. Importantly, we showed that dCas9-VP160 acts on patients' cells in vitro, particularly the fibroblasts of patients with T1D.	CA Giménez|M Ielpi|A Mutto|L Grosembacher|P Argibay|F Pereyra-Bonnet
27045713	Phage and bacteria have engaged in a sustainable arms race, a seemingly endless conflict, since the beginning of time. CRISPR-Cas systems shape and generate environmental diversity through evolution of both predator and prey genomes. Indeed, the gain or loss of CRISPR-mediated immunity and genome maintenance can spark speciation in bacteria. Alternatively, turning CRISPR-Cas on the host by targeting chromosomal DNA has led to the development of next-generation smart antimicrobials and genetic screening and engineering technologies. Although the ability to target and cleave DNA in a sequence-specific manner is a powerful mechanism utilized by bacteria to fend off phage, plasmids, and potentially harmful nucleic acids, it is also a promising technology for programmable targeting of undesirable bacteria in microbiome consortia.

27040868	The sudden emergence and worldwide adoption of CRISPR gene-editing technology confronts humanity with unprecedented opportunities and choices. CRISPR's transformative impact on our future understanding of biology, along with its potential to unleash control over the most fundamental of biological processes, is predictable by already achieved applications. Although its origin, composition, and function were revealed only recently, close to 3000 CRISPR-based publications have appeared including insightful and diversely focused reviews referenced here. Adding further to scientific and public awareness, a recent symposium addressed the ethical implications of interfacing CRISPR technology and human biology. However, the magnitude of CRISPR's rapidly emerging power mandates its broadest assessment. Only with the participation of a diverse and informed community can the most effective and humanity-positive CRISPR applications be defined. This brief review is aimed at those with little previous exposure to the CRISPR revolution. The molecules that constitute CRISPR's core components and their functional organization are described along with how the mechanism has been harnessed to edit genome structure and modulate gene function. Additionally, a glimpse into CRISPR's potential to unleash genetic changes with far-reaching consequences is presented.	A Peterson

27036863	Programmable control of the cell cycle has been shown to be a powerful tool in cell-biology studies. Here, we develop a novel system for controlling the bacterial cell cycle, based on binding of CRISPR/dCas9 to the origin-of-replication locus. Initiation of replication of bacterial chromosomes is accurately regulated by the DnaA protein, which promotes the unwinding of DNA at oriC We demonstrate that the binding of CRISPR/dCas9 to any position within origin or replication blocks the initiation of replication. Serial-dilution plating, single-cell fluorescence microscopy, and flow-cytometry experiments show that ongoing rounds of chromosome replication are finished upon CRISPR/dCas9 binding, but no new rounds are initiated. Upon arrest, cells stay metabolically active and accumulate cell mass. We find that elevating the temperature from 37 to 42°C releases the CRISR/dCas9 replication inhibition, and we use this feature to recover cells from the arrest. Our simple and robust method of controlling the bacterial cell cycle is a useful asset for synthetic biology and DNA-replication studies in particular. The inactivation of CRISPR/dCas9 binding at elevated temperatures may furthermore be of wide interest for CRISPR/Cas9 applications in genomic engineering.	J Wiktor|C Lesterlin|DJ Sherratt|C Dekker
27036064	In this review, the protective function of the abundant non-coding DNA in the eukaryotic genome is discussed from the perspective of genome defense against exogenous nucleic acids. Peripheral non-coding DNA has been proposed to act as a bodyguard that protects the genome and the central protein-coding sequences from ionizing radiation-induced DNA damage. In the proposed mechanism of protection, the radicals generated by water radiolysis in the cytosol and IR energy are absorbed, blocked and/or reduced by peripheral heterochromatin; then, the DNA damage sites in the heterochromatin are removed and expelled from the nucleus to the cytoplasm through nuclear pore complexes, most likely through the formation of extrachromosomal circular DNA. To strengthen this hypothesis, this review summarizes the experimental evidence supporting the protective function of non-coding DNA against exogenous nucleic acids. Based on these data, I hypothesize herein about the presence of an additional line of defense formed by small RNAs in the cytosol in addition to their bodyguard protection mechanism in the nucleus. Therefore, exogenous nucleic acids may be initially inactivated in the cytosol by small RNAs generated from non-coding DNA via mechanisms similar to the prokaryotic CRISPR-Cas system. Exogenous nucleic acids may enter the nucleus, where some are absorbed and/or blocked by heterochromatin and others integrate into chromosomes. The integrated fragments and the sites of DNA damage are removed by repetitive non-coding DNA elements in the heterochromatin and excluded from the nucleus. Therefore, the normal eukaryotic genome and the central protein-coding sequences are triply protected by non-coding DNA against invasion by exogenous nucleic acids. This review provides evidence supporting the protective role of non-coding DNA in genome defense.	GH Qiu
27035975	Eukaryotic Argonaute proteins induce gene silencing by small RNA-guided recognition and cleavage of mRNA targets. Although structural similarities between human and prokaryotic Argonautes are consistent with shared mechanistic properties, sequence and structure-based alignments suggested that Argonautes encoded within CRISPR-cas [clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated] bacterial immunity operons have divergent activities. We show here that the CRISPR-associated Marinitoga piezophila Argonaute (MpAgo) protein cleaves single-stranded target sequences using 5'-hydroxylated guide RNAs rather than the 5'-phosphorylated guides used by all known Argonautes. The 2.0-Å resolution crystal structure of an MpAgo-RNA complex reveals a guide strand binding site comprising residues that block 5' phosphate interactions. Using structure-based sequence alignment, we were able to identify other putative MpAgo-like proteins, all of which are encoded within CRISPR-cas loci. Taken together, our data suggest the evolution of an Argonaute subclass with noncanonical specificity for a 5'-hydroxylated guide.	E Kaya|KW Doxzen|KR Knoll|RC Wilson|SC Strutt|PJ Kranzusch|JA Doudna
27032928	The CRISPR/Cas9 system has been proven as a revolutionary genome engineering tool. In most cases, single guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting sites have been designed as GN19NGG or GGN18NGG, because of restriction of the initiation nucleotide for RNA Pol III promoters. Here, we demonstrate that the U6 promoter from a lepidopteran model insect, Bombyx mori, effectively expressed the sgRNA initiated with any nucleotide bases (adenine, thymine, guanine or cytosine), which further expands the CRISPR targeting space. A detailed expansion index in the genome was analysed when N20NGG was set as the CRISPR targeting site instead of GN19NGG, and revealed a significant increase of suitable targets, with the highest increase occurring on the Z sex chromosome. Transfection of different types of N20NGG sgRNAs targeting the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) combined with Cas9, significantly reduced EGFP expression in the BmN cells. An endogenous gene, BmBLOS2, was also disrupted by using various types of N20NGG sgRNAs, and the cleavage efficiency of N20NGG sgRNAs with different initial nucleotides and GC contents was evaluated in vitro. Furthermore, transgenic silkworms expressing Cas9 and sgRNAs targeting the BmBLOS2 gene were generated with many types of mutagenesis. The typical transparent skin phenotype in knock-out silkworms was stable and inheritable, suggesting that N20NGG sgRNAs function sufficiently in vivo. Our findings represent a renewal of CRISPR/Cas9 target design and will greatly facilitate insect functional genetics research.	B Zeng|S Zhan|Y Wang|Y Huang|J Xu|Q Liu|Z Li|Y Huang|A Tan

27025950	Clustered regularly-interspaced palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based genetic screens using single-guide-RNA (sgRNA) libraries have proven powerful to identify genetic regulators. Applying CRISPR screens to interrogate functional elements in noncoding regions requires generating sgRNA libraries that are densely covering, and ideally inexpensive, easy to implement and flexible for customization. Here we present a Molecular Chipper technology for generating dense sgRNA libraries for genomic regions of interest, and a proof-of-principle screen that identifies novel cis-regulatory domains for miR-142 biogenesis. The Molecular Chipper approach utilizes a combination of random fragmentation and a type III restriction enzyme to derive a densely covering sgRNA library from input DNA. Applying this approach to 17 microRNAs and their flanking regions and with a reporter for miR-142 activity, we identify both the pre-miR-142 region and two previously unrecognized cis-domains important for miR-142 biogenesis, with the latter regulating miR-142 processing. This strategy will be useful for identifying functional noncoding elements in mammalian genomes.	J Cheng|CA Roden|W Pan|S Zhu|A Baccei|X Pan|T Jiang|Y Kluger|SM Weissman|S Guo|RA Flavell|Y Ding|J Lu

27015359	How behavioural diversity emerged in evolution is an unexplored subject in biology. To tackle this problem, genes and circuits for a behaviour need to be determined in different species for phylogenetic comparisons. The recently developed clustered regulatory interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR associated protein9 (CRISPR/Cas9) system made such a challenge possible by providing the means to induce mutations in a gene of interest in any organism. Aiming at elucidating diversification in genetic and neural networks for courtship behaviour, we attempted to generate a genetic tool kit in Drosophila subobscura, a nonmodel species distantly related to the genetic model Drosophila melanogaster. Here we report the generation of yellow (y) and white mutations with the aid of the CRISPR/Cas9 system, and the rescue of the y mutant phenotype by germline transformation of the newly established y mutant fly line with a y(+) -marked piggyBac vector. This successful mutagenesis and transformation in D. subobscura open up an avenue for comprehensive genetic analyses of higher functions in this and other nonmodel Drosophila species, representing a key step toward systematic comparisons of genes and circuitries underlying behaviour amongst species.

27013255	RNA interference (RNAi) provides a powerful tool to silence specific gene expression and has been widely used to suppress host factors such as CCR5 and/or viral genes involved in HIV-1 replication. Newer nuclease-based gene-editing technologies, such as zinc finger nucleases (ZFN), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALEN) and the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 system, also provide powerful tools to ablate specific genes. Because of differences in co-receptor usage and the high mutability of the HIV-1 genome, a combination of host factors and viral genes needs to be suppressed for effective prevention and treatment of HIV-1 infection. Whereas the continued presence of small interfering/short hairpin RNA (si/shRNA) mediators is needed for RNAi to be effective, the continued expression of nucleases in the gene-editing systems is undesirable. Thus, RNAi provides the only practical way for expression of multiple silencers in infected and uninfected cells, which is needed for effective prevention/treatment of infection. There have been several advances in the RNAi field in terms of si/shRNA design, targeted delivery to HIV-1 susceptible cells, and testing for efficacy in preclinical humanized mouse models. Here, we comprehensively review the latest advances in RNAi technology towards prevention and treatment of HIV-1.	MN Swamy|H Wu|P Shankar
27010574	SdhE is required for the flavinylation and activation of succinate dehydrogenase and fumarate reductase (FRD). In addition, SdhE is conserved in proteobacteria (α, β and γ) and eukaryotes. Although the function of this recently characterized family of proteins has been determined, almost nothing is known about how their genes are regulated. Here, the RsmA (CsrA) and RsmC (HexY) post-transcriptional and post-translational regulators have been identified and shown to repress sdhEygfX expression in Serratia sp. ATCC 39006. Conversely, the flagella master regulator complex, FlhDC, activated sdhEygfX transcription. To investigate the hierarchy of control, we developed a novel approach that utilized endogenous CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-Cas (CRISPR associated) genome-editing by a type I-F system to generate a chromosomal point mutation in flhC. Mutation of flhC alleviated the ability of RsmC to repress sdhEygfX expression, whereas RsmA acted in both an FlhDC-dependent and -independent manner to inhibit sdhEygfX. Mutation of rsmA or rsmC, or overexpression of FlhDC, led to increased prodigiosin, biosurfactant, swimming and swarming. Consistent with the modulation of sdhE by motility regulators, we have demonstrated that SdhE and FRD are required for maximal flagella-dependent swimming. Together, these results demonstrate that regulators of both metabolism and motility (RsmA, RsmC and FlhDC) control the transcription of the sdhEygfX operon.

27004771	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) are part of an acquired bacterial immune system that functions as a barrier to exogenous genetic elements. Since naturalized Escherichia coli are likely to encounter different genetic elements in aquatic environments compared to enteric strains, we hypothesized that such differences would be reflected within the hypervariable CRISPR alleles of these two populations. Comparison of CRISPR1 alleles from naturalized and fecal phylogroup B1 E. coli strains revealed that the alleles could be categorized into four major distinct groups (designated G6-G9), and all four allele groups were found among naturalized strains and fecal strains. The distribution of CRIPSR G6 and G8 alleles was similar among strains of both ecotypes, while naturalized strains tended to have CRISPR G7 alleles rather than G9 alleles. Since CRISPR G7 alleles were not specific to naturalized strains, they, however, would not be useful as a marker for identifying naturalized strains. Notably, CRISPR alleles from naturalized and fecal strains also had similar spacer repertoires. This indicates a shared history of encounter with mobile genetic elements and suggests that the two populations were derived from common ancestors.	LD Tymensen
26999422	RNA is involved in a wide-range of important molecular processes in the cell, serving diverse functions: regulatory, enzymatic, and structural. Together with its ease and predictability of design, these properties can lead RNA to become a useful handle for biological engineers with which to control the cellular machinery. By modifying the many RNA links in cellular processes, it is possible to reprogram cells toward specific design goals. We propose that RNA can be viewed as a molecular programming language that, together with protein-based execution platforms, can be used to rewrite wide ranging aspects of cellular function. In this review, we catalogue developments in the use of RNA parts, methods, and associated computational models that have contributed to the programmability of biology. We discuss how RNA part repertoires have been combined to build complex genetic circuits, and review recent applications of RNA-based parts and circuitry. We explore the future potential of RNA engineering and posit that RNA programmability is an important resource for firmly establishing an era of rationally designed synthetic biology.

26996962	A subclass of recently discovered CRISPR repeat RNA in bacteria contains minimally recognizable structural features that facilitate an unknown mechanism of recognition and processing by the Cas6 family of endoribonucleases. Cocrystal structures of Cas6 from Methanococcus maripaludis (MmCas6b) bound with its repeat RNA revealed a dual site binding structure and a cleavage site conformation poised for phosphodiester bond breakage. Two non-interacting MmCas6b bind to two separate AAYAA motifs within the same repeat, one distal and one adjacent to the cleavage site. This bound structure potentially competes with a stable but non-productive RNA structure. At the cleavage site, MmCas6b supplies a base pair mimic to stabilize a short 2 base pair stem immediately upstream of the scissile phosphate. Complementary biochemical analyses support the dual-AAYAA binding model and a critical role of the protein-RNA base pair mimic. Our results reveal a previously unknown method of processing non-stem-loop CRISPR RNA by Cas6.	Y Shao|H Richter|S Sun|K Sharma|H Urlaub|L Randau|H Li
26996256	The recently discovered CRISPR/Cas9 endonuclease system, comprised of a guide RNA for the recognition of a DNA target and the Cas9 nuclease protein for binding and processing the target, has been extensively studied and has been widely applied in genome editing, synthetic biology, and transcriptional modulation in cells and animals. Toward more precise genomic modification and further expansion of the CRISPR/Cas9 system as a spatiotemporally controlled gene regulatory system, several approaches of conditional activation of Cas9 function using small molecules and light have recently been developed. These methods have led to improvements in the genome editing specificity of the CRISPR/Cas9 system and enabled its activation with temporal and spatial precision.	W Zhou|A Deiters
26993776	Although brain tumors have been known tremendously over the past decade, there are still many problems to be solved. The etiology of brain tumors is not well understood and the treatment remains modest. There is in great need to develop a suitable brain tumor models that faithfully mirror the etiology of human brain neoplasm and subsequently get more efficient therapeutic approaches for these disorders. In this review, we described the current status of animal models of brain tumors and analyzed their advantages and disadvantages. Additionally, prokaryotic clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9), a versatile genome editing technology for investigating the functions of target genes, and its application were also introduced in our present work. We firstly proposed that brain tumor modeling could be well established via CRISPR/Cas9 techniques. And CRISPR/Cas9-mediated brain tumor modeling was likely to be more suitable for figuring out the pathogenesis of brain tumors, as CRISPR/Cas9 platform was a simple and more efficient biological toolbox for implementing mutagenesis of oncogenes or tumor suppressors that were closely linked with brain tumors.

26979473	Although current antiviral strategies can inhibit baculovirus infection and decrease viral DNA replication to a certain extent, novel tools are required for specific and accurate elimination of baculovirus genomes from infected insects. Using the newly developed clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/associated protein 9 nuclease (CRISPR/Cas9) technology, we disrupted a viral genome in infected insect cells in vitro as a defense against viral infection. We optimized the CRISPR/Cas9 system to edit foreign and viral genome in insect cells. Using Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) as a model, we found that the CRISPR/Cas9 system was capable of cleaving the replication key factor ie-1 in BmNPV thus effectively inhibiting virus proliferation. Furthermore, we constructed a virus-inducible CRISPR/Cas9 editing system, which minimized the probability of off-target effects and was rapidly activated after viral infection. This is the first report describing the application of the CRISPR/Cas9 system in insect antiviral research. Establishment of a highly efficient virus-inducible CRISPR/Cas9 system in insect cells provides insights to produce virus-resistant transgenic strains for future.

26971820	Developing technologies for efficient and scalable disruption of gene expression will provide powerful tools for studying gene function, developmental pathways, and disease mechanisms. Here, we develop clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat interference (CRISPRi) to repress gene expression in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). CRISPRi, in which a doxycycline-inducible deactivated Cas9 is fused to a KRAB repression domain, can specifically and reversibly inhibit gene expression in iPSCs and iPSC-derived cardiac progenitors, cardiomyocytes, and T lymphocytes. This gene repression system is tunable and has the potential to silence single alleles. Compared with CRISPR nuclease (CRISPRn), CRISPRi gene repression is more efficient and homogenous across cell populations. The CRISPRi system in iPSCs provides a powerful platform to perform genome-scale screens in a wide range of iPSC-derived cell types, dissect developmental pathways, and model disease.

26961701	In this study, Cas9 system was employed to down-regulate mdr1 gene for overcoming multidrug resistance of cancer cells. Disruption of the MDR1 gene was achieved by delivery of the Cas9-sgRNA plasmid or the Cas9-sgRNA ribonucleoprotein complex using a conventional gene transfection agent and protein transduction domain (PTD). Doxorubicin showed considerable cytotoxicity to the drug-resistant breast cancer cells pre-treated with the RNA-guided endonuclease (RGEN) systems, whereas virtually non-toxic to the untreated cells. The potency of drug was enhanced in the cells treated with the protein-RNA complex as well as in those treated with plasmids, suggesting that mutation of the mdr1 gene by intracellular delivery of Cas9-sgRNA complex using proper protein delivery platforms could recover the drug susceptibility. Therefore, Cas9-mediated disruption of the drug resistance-related gene can be considered as a promising way to overcome multidrug resistance in cancer cells.	JS Ha|J Byun|DR Ahn

26956996	CRISPR-Cas systems provide adaptive immunity to mobile genetic elements in prokaryotes. In many bacteria, including E. coli, a specialized ribonucleoprotein complex called Cascade enacts immunity by" an interference reaction" between CRISPR encoded RNA (crRNA) and invader DNA sequences called "protospacers". Cascade recognizes invader DNA via short "protospacer adjacent motif" (PAM) sequences and crRNA-DNA complementarity. This triggers degradation of invader DNA by Cas3 protein and in some circumstances stimulates capture of new invader DNA protospacers for incorporation into CRISPR as "spacers" by Cas1 and Cas2 proteins, thus enhancing immunity. Co-expression of Cascade, Cas3 and crRNA is effective at giving E. coli cells resistance to phage lysis, if a transcriptional repressor of Cascade and CRISPR, H-NS, is inactivated (Δhns). We present further genetic analyses of the regulation of CRISPR-Cas mediated phage resistance in Δhns E. coli cells.	We observed that E. coli Type I-E CRISPR-Cas mediated resistance to phage λ was strongly temperature dependent, when repeating previously published experimental procedures. Further genetic analyses highlighted the importance of culture conditions for controlling the extent of CRISPR immunity in E. coli. These data identified that expression levels of cas3 is an important limiting factor for successful resistance to phage. Significantly, we describe the new identification that cas3 is also under transcriptional control by H-NS but that this is exerted only in stationary phase cells.	Regulation of cas3 is responsive to phase of growth, and to growth temperature in E. coli, impacting on the efficacy of CRISPR-Cas immunity in these experimental systems.

26956543	Applications of the CRISPR-Cas9 system to edit the genome have widely expanded to include DNA gene knock-out, deletions, chromosomal rearrangements, RNA editing and genome-wide screenings. Here we show the application of CRISPR-Cas9 technology to edit the mouse and human immunoglobulin (Ig) genes. By delivering Cas9 and guide-RNA (gRNA) with retro- or lenti-virus to IgM(+) mouse B cells and hybridomas, we induce class-switch recombination (CSR) of the IgH chain to the desired subclass. Similarly, we induce CSR in all human B cell lines tested with high efficiency to targeted IgH subclass. Finally, we engineer mouse hybridomas to secrete Fab' fragments instead of the whole Ig. Our results indicate that Ig genes in mouse and human cells can be edited to obtain any desired IgH switching helpful to study the biology of normal and lymphoma B cells. We also propose applications that could transform the technology of antibody production.	TC Cheong|M Compagno|R Chiarle

26949040	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins constitute an adaptive immune system in prokaryotes. The system preserves memories of prior infections by integrating short segments of foreign DNA, termed spacers, into the CRISPR array in a process termed adaptation. During the past 3 years, significant progress has been made on the genetic requirements and molecular mechanisms of adaptation. Here we review these recent advances, with a focus on the experimental approaches that have been developed, the insights they generated, and a proposed mechanism for self- versus non-self-discrimination during the process of spacer selection. We further describe the regulation of adaptation and the protein players involved in this fascinating process that allows bacteria and archaea to harbor adaptive immunity.

26947064	In eukaryotic cells, macroautophagy is a catabolic pathway implicated in the degradation of long-lived proteins and damaged organelles. Although it has been demonstrated that macroautophagy can selectively degrade specific targets, its contribution to the basal turnover of cellular proteins has not been quantified on proteome-wide scales. In this study, we created autophagy-deficient primary human fibroblasts and quantified the resulting changes in basal degradative flux by dynamic proteomics. Our results provide a global comparison of protein half-lives between wild-type and autophagy-deficient cells. The data indicate that in quiescent fibroblasts, macroautophagy contributes to the basal turnover of a substantial fraction of the proteome at varying levels. As contrasting examples, we demonstrate that the proteasome and CCT/TRiC chaperonin are robust substrates of basal autophagy, whereas the ribosome is largely protected under basal conditions. This selectivity may establish a proteostatic feedback mechanism that stabilizes the proteasome and CCT/TRiC when autophagy is inhibited.	T Zhang|S Shen|J Qu|S Ghaemmaghami

26945042	CRISPR-Cas9 is widely applied for genome engineering in various organisms. The assembly of single guide RNA (sgRNA) with the Cas9 protein may limit the Cas9/sgRNA effector complex function. We developed a FRET-based assay for detection of CRISPR-Cas9 complex binding to its targets and used this assay to investigate the kinetics of Cas9 assembly with a set of structurally distinct sgRNAs. We find that Cas9 and isolated sgRNAs form the effector complex efficiently and rapidly. Yet, the assembly process is sensitive to the presence of moderate concentrations of non-specific RNA competitors, which considerably delay the Cas9/sgRNA complex formation, while not significantly affecting already formed complexes. This observation suggests that the rate of sgRNA loading into Cas9 in cells can be determined by competition between sgRNA and intracellular RNA molecules for the binding to Cas9. Non-specific RNAs exerted particularly large inhibitory effects on formation of Cas9 complexes with sgRNAs bearing shortened 3'-terminal segments. This result implies that the 3'-terminal segment confers sgRNA the ability to withstand competition from non-specific RNA and at least in part may explain the fact that use of sgRNAs truncated for the 3'-terminal stem loops leads to reduced activity during genomic editing.

26941020	Although early proof-of-concept studies of somatic in vivo genome editing of the mouse ortholog of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (Pcsk9) in mice have established its therapeutic potential for the prevention of cardiovascular disease, the unique nature of genome-editing technology-permanent alteration of genomic DNA sequences-mandates that it be tested in vivo against human genes in normal human cells with human genomes to give reliable preclinical insights into the efficacy (on-target mutagenesis) and safety (lack of off-target mutagenesis) of genome-editing therapy before it can be used in patients.	We used a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated (Cas) 9 genome-editing system to target the human PCSK9 gene in chimeric liver-humanized mice bearing human hepatocytes. We demonstrated high on-target mutagenesis (approaching 50%), greatly reduced blood levels of human PCSK9 protein, and minimal off-target mutagenesis.	This work yields important information on the efficacy and safety of CRISPR-Cas9 therapy targeting the human PCSK9 gene in human hepatocytes in vivo, and it establishes humanized mice as a useful platform for the preclinical assessment of applications of somatic in vivo genome editing.

26936325	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats with CRISPR-associated gene (CRISPR-Cas) systems are widely recognized as critical genome defense systems that protect microbes from external threats such as bacteriophage infection. Several isolates of the intracellular pathogen Legionella pneumophila possess multiple CRISPR-Cas systems (type I-C, type I-F and type II-B), yet the targets of these systems remain unknown. With the recent observation that at least one of these systems (II-B) plays a non-canonical role in supporting intracellular replication, the possibility remained that these systems are vestigial genome defense systems co-opted for other purposes. Our data indicate that this is not the case. Using an established plasmid transformation assay, we demonstrate that type I-C, I-F and II-B CRISPR-Cas provide protection against spacer targets. We observe efficient laboratory acquisition of new spacers under 'priming' conditions, in which initially incomplete target elimination leads to the generation of new spacers and ultimate loss of the invasive DNA. Critically, we identify the first known target of L. pneumophila CRISPR-Cas: a 30 kb episome of unknown function whose interbacterial transfer is guarded against by CRISPR-Cas. We provide evidence that the element can subvert CRISPR-Cas by mutating its targeted sequences - but that primed spacer acquisition may limit this mechanism of escape. Rather than generally impinging on bacterial fitness, this element drives a host specialization event - with improved fitness in Acanthamoeba but a reduced ability to replicate in other hosts and conditions. These observations add to a growing body of evidence that host range restriction can serve as an existential threat to L. pneumophila in the wild.

26933736	Programmable DNA nucleases have provided scientists with the unprecedented ability to probe, regulate, and manipulate the human genome. Zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat-Cas9 system (CRISPR-Cas9) represent a powerful array of tools that can bind to and cleave a specified DNA sequence. In their canonical forms, these nucleases induce double-strand breaks at a DNA locus of interest that can trigger cellular DNA repair processes that disrupt or replace genes. The fusion of these programmable nucleases with a variety of other protein domains has led to a rapidly growing suite of tools for activating, repressing, visualizing, and modifying loci of interest. Maximizing the usefulness and therapeutic relevance of these tools, however, requires precisely controlling their activity and specificity to minimize potentially toxic side effects arising from off-target activities. This need has motivated the application of chemical biology principles and methods to genome-editing proteins, including the engineering of variants of these proteins with improved or altered specificities, and the development of genetic, chemical, optical, and protein delivery methods that control the activity of these agents in cells. Advancing the capabilities, safety, effectiveness, and therapeutic relevance of genome-engineering proteins will continue to rely on chemical biology strategies that manipulate their activity, specificity, and localization.

26932460	With the recent development of CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas9 genome editing technology, the possibility to genetically manipulate the human germline (gametes and embryos) has become a distinct technical possibility. Although many technical challenges still need to be overcome in order to achieve adequate efficiency and precision of the technology in human embryos, the path leading to genome editing has never been simpler, more affordable, and widespread.	In this narrative review we seek to understand the possible impact of CRISR/Cas9 technology on human reproduction from the technical and ethical point of view, and suggest a course of action for the scientific community.	This non-systematic review was carried out using Medline articles in English, as well as technical documents from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority and reports in the media. The technical possibilities of the CRISPR/Cas9 technology with regard to human reproduction are analysed based on results obtained in model systems such as large animals and laboratory rodents. Further, the possibility of CRISPR/Cas9 use in the context of human reproduction, to modify embryos, germline cells, and pluripotent stem cells is reviewed based on the authors' expert opinion. Finally, the possible uses and consequences of CRISPR/cas9 gene editing in reproduction are analysed from the ethical point of view.	We identify critical technical and ethical issues that should deter from employing CRISPR/Cas9 based technologies in human reproduction until they are clarified.	Overcoming the numerous technical limitations currently associated with CRISPR/Cas9 mediated editing of the human germline will depend on intensive research that needs to be transparent and widely disseminated. Rather than a call to a generalized moratorium, or banning, of this type of research, efforts should be placed on establishing an open, international, collaborative and regulated research framework. Equally important, a societal discussion on the risks, benefits, and preferred applications of the new technology, including all relevant stakeholders, is urgently needed and should be promoted, and ultimately guide research priorities in this area.

26917774	CRISPR systems mediate adaptive immunity in diverse prokaryotes. CRISPR-associated Cas1 and Cas2 proteins have been shown to enable adaptation to new threats in type I and II CRISPR systems by the acquisition of short segments of DNA (spacers) from invasive elements. In several type III CRISPR systems, Cas1 is naturally fused to a reverse transcriptase (RT). In the marine bacterium Marinomonas mediterranea (MMB-1), we showed that a RT-Cas1 fusion protein enables the acquisition of RNA spacers in vivo in a RT-dependent manner. In vitro, the MMB-1 RT-Cas1 and Cas2 proteins catalyze the ligation of RNA segments into the CRISPR array, which is followed by reverse transcription. These observations outline a host-mediated mechanism for reverse information flow from RNA to DNA.	S Silas|G Mohr|DJ Sidote|LM Markham|A Sanchez-Amat|D Bhaya|AM Lambowitz|AZ Fire

26914853	More than 100 liver-related disorders are caused by mutations in a single gene. These include both inherited and acquired genetic disorders. The development of nucleic acid-based therapies for liver diseases has been severely restricted due to many undesirable side effects and methodological limitations.	In recent years, however, efforts have been intensified to address these issues, and to develop liver-targeted approaches using novel gene editing technologies, including ZFN, TALEN, CRISPR/Cas and PITCh. While each of these methods utilizes a distinct mechanism of gene modification at the genomic level, they all are dependent on an efficient delivery system to the target site within the host cell. This review will provide an overview on current and emerging therapeutic strategies for the treatment of liver diseases.	Clinical trials for liver gene therapy have entered an exciting stage and are already showing promise with the development of novel technologies and delivery options. A deeper understanding of off-target effects produced by gene editing approaches and immune responses generated in host cells by gene carriers is needed to fully realize their potential.

26912144	The CRISPR-Cas system of prokaryotic adaptive immunity displays features of a mechanism for directional, Lamarckian evolution. Indeed, this system modifies a specific locus in a bacterial or archaeal genome by inserting a piece of foreign DNA into a CRISPR array which results in acquired, heritable resistance to the cognate selfish element. A key element of the Lamarckian scheme is the specificity and directionality of the mutational process whereby an environmental cue causes only mutations that provide specific adaptations to the original challenge. In the case of adaptive immunity, the specificity of mutations is equivalent to self-nonself discrimination. Recent studies on the CRISPR mechanism have shown that the levels of discrimination can substantially differ such that in some CRISPR-Cas variants incorporation of DNA is random whereas discrimination occurs by selection of cells that carry cognate inserts. In other systems, a higher level of specificity appears to be achieved via specialized mechanisms. These findings emphasize the continuity between random and directed mutations and the critical importance of evolved mechanisms that govern the mutational process.	EV Koonin|YI Wolf

26903647	Leptin is the primary adipostatic factor in mammals. Produced largely by adipocytes in proportion to total adipose mass, the hormone informs the brain regarding total energy stored as triglycerides in fat cells. The hormone acts on multiple circuits in the brain to regulate food intake, autonomic outflow, and endocrine function to maintain energy balance. In addition to regulating adipose mass, mammalian leptin also plays a role in the regulation of glucose homeostasis and as a gating factor in reproductive competence. Leptin-deficient mice and people exhibit early onset profound hyperphagia and obesity, diabetes, and infertility. Although leptin and the leptin receptor are found in fish, the hormone is not expressed in adipose tissue, but is found in liver and other tissues. Here, we show that adult zebrafish lacking a functional leptin receptor do not exhibit hyperphagia or increased adiposity, and exhibit normal fertility. However, leptin receptor-deficient larvae have increased numbers of β-cells and increased levels of insulin mRNA. Furthermore, larval zebrafish have been shown to exhibit β-cell hyperplasia in response to high fat feeding or peripheral insulin resistance, and we show here that leptin receptor is required for this response. Adult zebrafish also have increased levels of insulin mRNA and other alterations in glucose homeostasis. Thus, a role for leptin in the regulation of β-cell mass and glucose homeostasis appears to be conserved across vertebrates, whereas its role as an adipostatic factor is likely to be a secondary role acquired during the evolution of mammals.

26896588	Genome editing with site-specific nucleases has become a powerful tool for functional characterization of plant genes and genetic improvement of agricultural crops. Among the various site-specific nuclease-based technologies available for genome editing, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) systems have shown the greatest potential for rapid and efficient editing of genomes in plant species. This article reviews the current status of application of CRISPR/Cas9 to plant genomics research, with a focus on loss-of-function and gain-of-function analysis of individual genes in the context of perennial plants and the potential application of CRISPR/Cas9 to perturbation of gene expression, and identification and analysis of gene modules as part of an accelerated domestication and synthetic biology effort.

26894836	Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) RNA-guided endonucleases are powerful new tools for targeted genome engineering. These nucleases provide an efficient and precise method for manipulating eukaryotic genomes; however, delivery of these reagents to specific cell-types remains challenging. Virus-like particles (VLPs) derived from bacteriophage P22, are robust supramolecular protein cage structures with demonstrated utility for cell type-specific delivery of encapsulated cargos. Here, we genetically fuse Cas9 to a truncated form of the P22 scaffold protein, which acts as a template for capsid assembly as well as a specific encapsulation signal for Cas9. Our results indicate that Cas9 and a single-guide RNA are packaged inside the P22 VLP, and activity assays indicate that this RNA-guided endonuclease is functional for sequence-specific cleavage of dsDNA targets. This work demonstrates the potential for developing P22 as a delivery vehicle for cell specific targeting of Cas9.	S Qazi|HM Miettinen|RA Wilkinson|K McCoy|T Douglas|B Wiedenheft

26887345	It is well known that occludin (OCLN) is involved in hepatitis C virus (HCV) entry into hepatocytes, but there has been no conclusive evidence that OCLN is essential for HCV infection. In this study, we first established an OCLN-knockout cell line derived from human hepatic Huh7.5.1-8 cells using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 system, in which two independent targeting plasmids expressing single-guide RNAs were used. One established cell clone, named OKH-4, had the OCLN gene truncated in the N-terminal region, and a complete defect of the OCLN protein was shown using immunoblot analysis. Infection of OKH-4 cells with various genotypes of HCV was abolished, and exogenous expression of the OCLN protein in OKH-4 cells completely reversed permissiveness to HCV infection. In addition, using a co-culture system of HCV-infected Huh7.5.1-8 cells with OKH-4 cells, we showed that OCLN is also critical for cell-to-cell HCV transmission. Thus, we concluded that OCLN is essential for HCV infection of human hepatic cells. Further experiments using HCV genomic RNA-transfected OKH-4 cells or HCV subgenomic replicon-harboring OKH-4 cells suggested that OCLN is mainly involved in the entry step of the HCV life cycle. It was also demonstrated that the second extracellular loop of OCLN, especially the two cysteine residues, is critical for HCV infection of hepatic cells. OKH-4 cells may be a useful tool for understanding not only the entire mechanism of HCV entry, but also the biological functions of OCLN.

26879140	CRISPR-Cas9 mediated genome editing system has been developed as a powerful tool for elucidating the function of genes through genetic engineering in multiple cells and organisms. This system takes advantage of a single guide RNA (sgRNA) to direct the Cas9 endonuclease to a specific DNA site to generate mutant alleles. Since the targeting efficiency of sgRNAs to distinct DNA loci can vary widely, there remains a need for a rapid, simple and efficient sgRNA selection method to overcome this limitation of the CRISPR-Cas9 system. Here we report a novel system to select sgRNA with high efficacy for DNA sequence modification by a luciferase assay. Using this sgRNAs selection system, we further demonstrated successful examples of one sgRNA for generating one gene knockout cell lines where the targeted genes are shown to be functionally defective. This system provides a potential application to optimize the sgRNAs in different species and to generate a powerful CRISPR-Cas9 genome-wide screening system with minimum amounts of sgRNAs.

26875679	Engineered gene drives - the process of stimulating the biased inheritance of specific genes - have the potential to enable the spread of desirable genes throughout wild populations or to suppress harmful species, and may be particularly useful for the control of vector-borne diseases such as malaria. Although several types of selfish genetic elements exist in nature, few have been successfully engineered in the laboratory thus far. With the discovery of RNA-guided CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-CRISPR-associated 9) nucleases, which can be utilized to create, streamline and improve synthetic gene drives, this is rapidly changing. Here, we discuss the different types of engineered gene drives and their potential applications, as well as current policies regarding the safety and regulation of gene drives for the manipulation of wild populations.

26874259	The production of bioenergy from plant biomass previously relied on using microorganisms that rapidly and efficiently convert simple sugars into fuels and chemicals. However, to exploit the far more abundant carbon fixed in plant cell walls, future industrial production hosts will need to be engineered to leverage the most efficient biochemical pathways and most robust traits that can be found in nature. The CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technology now enables writing the genome at will, which will allow biotechnology to become an 'information science.' This review covers recent advances in using CRISPR-Cas9 to engineer the genomes of a wide variety of organisms that could be use in the industrial production of biofuels and renewable chemicals.

26872343	Klebsiella pneumoniae U25 is a multidrug resistant strain isolated from a tertiary care hospital in Chennai, India. Here, we report the complete annotated genome sequence of strain U25 obtained using PacBio RSII. This is the first report of the whole genome of K. pneumoniaespecies from Chennai. It consists of a single circular chromosome of size 5,491,870-bp and two plasmids of size 211,813 and 172,619-bp. The genes associated with multidrug resistance were identified. The chromosome of U25 was found to have eight antibiotic resistant genes [blaOXA-1,blaSHV-28, aac(6')1b-cr,catB3, oqxAB, dfrA1]. The plasmid pMGRU25-001 was found to have only one resistant gene (catA1) while plasmid pMGRU25-002 had 20 resistant genes [strAB, aadA1,aac(6')-Ib, aac(3)-IId,sul1,2, blaTEM-1A,1B,blaOXA-9, blaCTX-M-15,blaSHV-11, cmlA1, erm(B),mph(A)]. A mutation in the porin OmpK36 was identified which is likely to be associated with the intermediate resistance to carbapenems in the absence of carbapenemase genes. U25 is one of the few K. pneumoniaestrains to harbour clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) systems. Two CRISPR arrays corresponding to Cas3 family helicase were identified in the genome. When compared to K. pneumoniaeNTUHK2044, a transposase gene InsH of IS5-13 was found inserted.

26871258	Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPRs) system is a novel type of innate defense system in prokaryotes for destruction of exogenous elements. To gain further insight into behavior and organization of the system, the extensive analysis of the available sequenced genomes is necessary. The dynamic nature of CRISPR loci is possibly valuable for typing and relative analyses of strains and microbial population. There are a few orderly bioinformatics investigations about the structure of CRISPR sequences in the Escherichia coli strains. In this study, 57 CRISPR loci were selected from 32 Escherichia coli strains to investigate their structural characteristics and potential functions using bioinformatics tools. Our results showed that most strains contained several loci that mainly included conserved direct repeats, while the spacers were highly variable. Moreover, RNA analysis of the sequences indicated that all loci could form stable RNA secondary structures and showed homology mostly with phages compared to plasmids. Only three strains included cas genes around their loci.	SS Rahmatabadi|N Nezafat|M Negahdaripour|N Hajighahramani|MH Morowvat|Y Ghasemi

26867599	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) are inheritable genetic elements of a variety of archaea and bacteria and indicative of the bacterial ecological adaptation, conferring acquired immunity against invading foreign nucleic acids. Shigella is an important pathogen for anthroponosis. This study aimed to analyze the features of Shigella CRISPR structure and classify the spacers through bioinformatics approach. Among 107 Shigella, 434 CRISPR structure loci were identified with two to seven loci in different strains. CRISPR-Q1, CRISPR-Q4 and CRISPR-Q5 were widely distributed in Shigella strains. Comparison of the first and last repeats of CRISPR1, CRISPR2 and CRISPR3 revealed several base variants and different stem-loop structures. A total of 259 cas genes were found among these 107 Shigella strains. The cas gene deletions were discovered in 88 strains. However, there is one strain that does not contain cas gene. Intact clusters of cas genes were found in 19 strains. From comprehensive analysis of sequence signature and BLAST and CRISPRTarget score, the 708 spacers were classified into three subtypes: Type I, Type II and Type III. Of them, Type I spacer referred to those linked with one gene segment, Type II spacer linked with two or more different gene segments, and Type III spacer undefined. This study examined the diversity of CRISPR/cas system in Shigella strains, demonstrated the main features of CRISPR structure and spacer classification, which provided critical information for elucidation of the mechanisms of spacer formation and exploration of the role the spacers play in the function of the CRISPR/cas system.

26865412	Thalidomide and its derivatives, collectively referred to as immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs), are effective inhibitors of inflammation and are known to inhibit TLR-induced TNFα production. The identification of Cereblon as the receptor for these compounds has led to a rapid advancement in our understanding of IMiD properties; however, there remain no studies addressing the role of Cereblon in mediating the suppressive effect of IMiDs on TLR responses. Here, we developed Cereblon-deficient mice using the CRISPR-Cas9 system. TLR-induced cytokine responses were unaffected by Cereblon deficiency in vivo Moreover, IMiD treatment inhibited cytokine production even in the absence of Cereblon. The IMiD-induced suppression of cytokine production therefore occurs independently of Cereblon in mice. Further investigation revealed that IMiDs are potent inhibitors of TLR-induced type-1 interferon production via suppression of the TRIF/IRF3 pathway. These data suggest that IMiDs may prove effective in the treatment of disorders characterized by the ectopic production of type-1 interferon. Significantly, these properties are mediated separately from thalidomide's teratogenic receptor, Cereblon. Thus, certain therapeutic properties of Thalidomide can be separated from its harmful side effects.	D Millrine|H Miyata|M Tei|P Dubey|K Nyati|T Nakahama|Y Gemechu|B Ripley|T Kishimoto
26864203	The orchestrated action of genes controls complex biological phenotypes, yet the systematic discovery of gene and drug combinations that modulate these phenotypes in human cells is labor intensive and challenging to scale. Here, we created a platform for the massively parallel screening of barcoded combinatorial gene perturbations in human cells and translated these hits into effective drug combinations. This technology leverages the simplicity of the CRISPR-Cas9 system for multiplexed targeting of specific genomic loci and the versatility of combinatorial genetics en masse (CombiGEM) to rapidly assemble barcoded combinatorial genetic libraries that can be tracked with high-throughput sequencing. We applied CombiGEM-CRISPR to create a library of 23,409 barcoded dual guide-RNA (gRNA) combinations and then perform a high-throughput pooled screen to identify gene pairs that inhibited ovarian cancer cell growth when they were targeted. We validated the growth-inhibiting effects of specific gene sets, including epigenetic regulators KDM4C/BRD4 and KDM6B/BRD4, via individual assays with CRISPR-Cas-based knockouts and RNA-interference-based knockdowns. We also tested small-molecule drug pairs directed against our pairwise hits and showed that they exerted synergistic antiproliferative effects against ovarian cancer cells. We envision that the CombiGEM-CRISPR platform will be applicable to a broad range of biological settings and will accelerate the systematic identification of genetic combinations and their translation into novel drug combinations that modulate complex human disease phenotypes.

26863189	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) and the cas (CRISPR-associated) operon form an RNA-based adaptive immune system against foreign genetic elements in prokaryotes. Type I accounts for 95% of CRISPR systems, and has been used to control gene expression and cell fate. During CRISPR RNA (crRNA)-guided interference, Cascade (CRISPR-associated complex for antiviral defence) facilitates the crRNA-guided invasion of double-stranded DNA for complementary base-pairing with the target DNA strand while displacing the non-target strand, forming an R-loop. Cas3, which has nuclease and helicase activities, is subsequently recruited to degrade two DNA strands. A protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence flanking target DNA is crucial for self versus foreign discrimination. Here we present the 2.45 Å crystal structure of Escherichia coli Cascade bound to a foreign double-stranded DNA target. The 5'-ATG PAM is recognized in duplex form, from the minor groove side, by three structural features in the Cascade Cse1 subunit. The promiscuity inherent to minor groove DNA recognition rationalizes the observation that a single Cascade complex can respond to several distinct PAM sequences. Optimal PAM recognition coincides with wedge insertion, initiating directional target DNA strand unwinding to allow segmented base-pairing with crRNA. The non-target strand is guided along a parallel path 25 Å apart, and the R-loop structure is further stabilized by locking this strand behind the Cse2 dimer. These observations provide the structural basis for understanding the PAM-dependent directional R-loop formation process.	RP Hayes|Y Xiao|F Ding|PB van Erp|K Rajashankar|S Bailey|B Wiedenheft|A Ke
26852268	Clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats - CRISPR-associated (CRISPR-Cas) systems - are sequence-specific RNA-directed endonuclease complexes that bind and cleave nucleic acids. These systems evolved within prokaryotes as adaptive immune defenses to target and degrade nucleic acids derived from bacteriophages and other foreign genetic elements. The antiviral function of these systems has now been exploited to combat eukaryotic viruses throughout the viral life cycle. Here we discuss current advances in CRISPR-Cas9 technology as a eukaryotic antiviral defense.	AA Price|A Grakoui|DS Weiss
26850642	Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as regulators of gene expression across metazoa. Interestingly, some lncRNAs function independently of their transcripts - the transcription of the lncRNA locus itself affects target genes. However, current methods of loss-of-function analysis are insufficient to address the role of lncRNA transcription from the transcript which has impeded analysis of their function. Using the minimal CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) system, we show that coexpression of the catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9) and guide RNAs targeting the endogenous roX locus in the Drosophila cells results in a robust and specific knockdown of roX1 and roX2 RNAs, thus eliminating the need for recruiting chromatin modifying proteins for effective gene silencing. Additionally, we find that the human and Drosophila codon optimized dCas9 genes are functional and show similar transcription repressive activity. Finally, we demonstrate that the minimal CRISPRi system suppresses roX transcription efficiently in vivo resulting in loss-of-function phenotype, thus validating the method for the first time in a multicelluar organism. Our analysis expands the genetic toolkit available for interrogating lncRNA function in situ and is adaptable for targeting multiple genes across model organisms.	S Ghosh|C Tibbit|JL Liu
26850641	CRISPR/Cas9-induced site-specific DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) can be repaired by homology-directed repair (HDR) or non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathways. Extensive efforts have been made to knock-in exogenous DNA to a selected genomic locus in human cells; which, however, has focused on HDR-based strategies and was proven inefficient. Here, we report that NHEJ pathway mediates efficient rejoining of genome and plasmids following CRISPR/Cas9-induced DNA DSBs, and promotes high-efficiency DNA integration in various human cell types. With this homology-independent knock-in strategy, integration of a 4.6 kb promoterless ires-eGFP fragment into the GAPDH locus yielded up to 20% GFP+ cells in somatic LO2 cells, and 1.70% GFP+ cells in human embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Quantitative comparison further demonstrated that the NHEJ-based knock-in is more efficient than HDR-mediated gene targeting in all human cell types examined. These data support that CRISPR/Cas9-induced NHEJ provides a valuable new path for efficient genome editing in human ESCs and somatic cells.

26850639	Visualization of chromosomal dynamics is important for understanding many fundamental intra-nuclear processes. Efficient and reliable live-cell multicolor labeling of chromosomal loci can realize this goal. However, the current methods are constrained mainly by insufficient labeling throughput, efficiency, flexibility as well as photostability. Here we have developed a new approach to realize dual-color chromosomal loci imaging based on a modified single-guide RNA (sgRNA) of the CRISPR/Cas9 system. The modification of sgRNA was optimized by structure-guided engineering of the original sgRNA, consisting of RNA aptamer insertions that bind fluorescent protein-tagged effectors. By labeling and tracking telomeres, centromeres and genomic loci, we demonstrate that the new approach is easy to implement and enables robust dual-color imaging of genomic elements. Importantly, our data also indicate that the fast exchange rate of RNA aptamer binding effectors makes our sgRNA-based labeling method much more tolerant to photobleaching than the Cas9-based labeling method. This is crucial for continuous, long-term tracking of chromosomal dynamics. Lastly, as our method is complementary to other live-cell genomic labeling systems, it is therefore possible to combine them into a plentiful palette for the study of native chromatin organization and genome ultrastructure dynamics in living cells.

26849369	The genomes of more than 50 organisms have now been manipulated due to rapid advancement of gene editing technology. One way to perform gene editing in the mouse using the CRISPR/CAS system, guide RNA (gRNA) and CAS9 mRNA transcribed in vitro are microinjected into fertilized eggs that are then allowed to develop to term. As a rule, gRNAs are tested first in tissue culture cells and the one with the highest locus-specific cleavage activity is chosen for microinjection. For cell transfections, gRNAs are typically expressed using the human U6 promoter (hU6). However, gRNAs for microinjection into zygotes are obtained by in vitro transcription from a T7 bacteriophage promoter in a separate plasmid vector. Here, we describe the design and construction of a combined U6T7 hybrid promoter from which the same gRNA sequence can be expressed. An expression vector containing such a hybrid promoter can now be used to generate gRNA for testing in mammalian cells as well as for microinjection purposes. The gRNAs expressed and transcribed from this vector are found to be functional in cells as well as in mice.	PJ Romanienko|J Giacalone|J Ingenito|Y Wang|M Isaka|T Johnson|Y You|WH Mark
26848818	The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) system is widely used for various biological applications, including genome editing. We developed engineered DNA-binding molecule-mediated chromatin immunoprecipitation (enChIP) using CRISPR to isolate target genomic regions from cells for their biochemical characterization. In this study, we developed 'in vitro enChIP' using recombinant CRISPR ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) to isolate target genomic regions. in vitro enChIP has the great advantage over conventional enChIP of not requiring expression of CRISPR complexes in cells. We first showed that in vitro enChIP using recombinant CRISPR RNPs can be used to isolate target DNA from mixtures of purified DNA in a sequence-specific manner. In addition, we showed that this technology can be used to efficiently isolate target genomic regions, while retaining their intracellular molecular interactions, with negligible contamination from irrelevant genomic regions. Thus, in vitro enChIP technology is of potential use for sequence-specific isolation of DNA, as well as for identification of molecules interacting with genomic regions of interest in vivo in combination with downstream analysis.

26848786	The promise of gene therapy performed in the preimplantation and prenatal periods of pregnancy is rapidly becoming a reality. New technologies capable of making designed changes in single nucleotides make germline gene therapy possible. The article reviews the ethical and technical challenges of germline gene therapy.	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and related technologies are capable of deleting and inserting specific DNA sequences in mutated genes so as to correct the targeted DNA. The ability to target specific gene mutations will offer unique opportunities to at risk families, particularly those whose genotypes prevent any chance of a normal pregnancy outcome. Other applications of gene-modifying technologies on gametes, zygotes, and embryos are likely in the near future.	There will be renewed debates on the potentially controversial applications of these technologies because of their capability to genetically alter the human germline and thereby future generations.

26841432	Bacterial adaptive immunity and genome engineering involving the CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-associated (Cas) protein Cas9 begin with RNA-guided DNA unwinding to form an RNA-DNA hybrid and a displaced DNA strand inside the protein. The role of this R-loop structure in positioning each DNA strand for cleavage by the two Cas9 nuclease domains is unknown. We determine molecular structures of the catalytically active Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 R-loop that show the displaced DNA strand located near the RuvC nuclease domain active site. These protein-DNA interactions, in turn, position the HNH nuclease domain adjacent to the target DNA strand cleavage site in a conformation essential for concerted DNA cutting. Cas9 bends the DNA helix by 30°, providing the structural distortion needed for R-loop formation.	F Jiang|DW Taylor|JS Chen|JE Kornfeld|K Zhou|AJ Thompson|E Nogales|JA Doudna
26840090	All cancers have multiple mutations that can largely be grouped into certain classes depending on the function of the gene in which they lie and these include oncogenic changes that enhance cellular proliferation, loss of function of tumor suppressors that regulate cell growth potential and induction of metabolic enzymes that confer resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. Thus the ability to correct such mutations is an important goal in cancer treatment. Recent research has led to the developments of reagents which specifically target nucleotide sequences within the cellular genome and these have a huge potential for expanding our anticancer armamentarium. One such a reagent is the clustered regulatory interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-associated 9 (Cas9) system, a powerful, highly specific and adaptable tool that provides unparalleled control for editing the cellular genome. In this short review, we discuss the potential of CRISPR/Cas9 against human cancers and the current difficulties in translating this for novel therapeutic approaches.	MK White|K Khalili
26839115	The epiblast (foremost embryonic ectoderm) generates all three germ layers and therefore has crucial roles in the formation of all mammalian body cells. However, regulation of epiblast gene expression is poorly understood because of the difficulty of manipulating epiblast tissues in vivo. In the present study, using the self-organizing properties of mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC), we generated and characterized epiblast-like tissue in three-dimensional culture. We identified significant genome-wide gene expression changes in this epiblast-like tissue by transcriptomic analysis. In addition, we identified the particular significance of the Erk/Mapk and integrin-linked kinase pathways, and genes related to ectoderm/epithelial formation, using the bioinformatics resources IPA and DAVID. Here, we focused on Fgf5, which ranked in the top 10 among the discovered genes. To develop a functional analysis of Fgf5, we created an efficient method combining CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome engineering and RNA interference (RNAi). Notably, we show one-step generation of various Fgf5 reporter lines including heterozygous and homozygous knockins (the GET method). For time- and dose-dependent depletion of fgf5 over the course of development, we generated an ESC line harboring Tol2 transposon-mediated integration of an inducible short hairpin RNA interference system (pdiRNAi). Our findings raised the possibility that Fgf/Erk signaling and apicobasal epithelial integrity are important factors in epiblast development. In addition, our methods provide a framework for a broad array of applications in the areas of mammalian genetics and molecular biology to understand development and to improve future therapeutics.

26837577	A central goal of synthetic biology is to implement diverse cellular functions by predictably controlling gene expression. Though research has focused more on protein regulators than RNA regulators, recent advances in our understanding of RNA folding and functions have motivated the use of RNA regulators. RNA regulators provide an advantage because they are easier to design and engineer than protein regulators, potentially have a lower burden on the cell and are highly orthogonal. Here, we combine the CRISPR system from Streptococcus pyogenes and synthetic antisense RNAs (asRNAs) in Escherichia coli strains to repress or derepress a target gene in a programmable manner. Specifically, we demonstrate for the first time that the gene target repressed by the CRISPR system can be derepressed by expressing an asRNA that sequesters a small guide RNA (sgRNA). Furthermore, we demonstrate that tunable levels of derepression can be achieved (up to 95%) by designing asRNAs that target different regions of a sgRNA and by altering the hybridization free energy of the sgRNA-asRNA complex. This new system, which we call the combined CRISPR and asRNA system, can be used to reversibly repress or derepress multiple target genes simultaneously, allowing for rational reprogramming of cellular functions.

26829649	Recurrent, reciprocal genomic disorders resulting from non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) between near-identical segmental duplications (SDs) are a major cause of human disease, often producing phenotypically distinct syndromes. The genomic architecture of flanking SDs presents a challenge for modeling these syndromes; however, the capability to efficiently generate reciprocal copy number variants (CNVs) that mimic NAHR would represent a valuable modeling tool. We describe here a CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering method, single-guide CRISPR/Cas targeting of repetitive elements (SCORE), to model reciprocal genomic disorders and demonstrate its capabilities by generating reciprocal CNVs of 16p11.2 and 15q13.3, including alteration of one copy-equivalent of the SDs that mediate NAHR in vivo. The method is reproducible, and RNA sequencing reliably clusters transcriptional signatures from human subjects with in vivo CNVs and their corresponding in vitro models. This new approach will provide broad applicability for the study of genomic disorders and, with further development, may also permit efficient correction of these defects.

26829286	Corynebacterium glutamicum is an important organism for the industrial production of amino acids. Metabolic pathways in this organism are usually engineered by conventional methods such as homologous recombination, which depends on rare double-crossover events. To facilitate the mapping of gene expression levels to metabolic outputs, we applied CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) technology using deactivated Cas9 (dCas9) to repress genes in C. glutamicum. We then determined the effects of target repression on amino acid titers. Single-guide RNAs directing dCas9 to specific targets reduced expression of pgi and pck up to 98%, and of pyk up to 97%, resulting in titer enhancement ratios of l-lysine and l-glutamate production comparable to levels achieved by gene deletion. This approach for C. glutamicum metabolic engineering, which only requires 3 days, indicates that CRISPRi can be used for quick and efficient metabolic pathway remodeling without the need for gene deletions or mutations and subsequent selection.

26818725	CRISPR has been becoming a hot topic as a powerful technique for genome editing for human and other higher organisms. The original CRISPR-Cas (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats coupled with CRISPR-associated proteins) is an important adaptive defence system for prokaryotes that provides resistance against invading elements such as viruses and plasmids. A CRISPR cassette contains short nucleotide sequences called spacers. These unique regions retain a history of the interactions between prokaryotes and their invaders in individual strains and ecosystems. One important ecosystem in the human body is the human gut, a rich habitat populated by a great diversity of microorganisms. Gut microbiomes are important for human physiology and health. Metagenome sequencing has been widely applied for studying the gut microbiomes. Most efforts in metagenome study has been focused on profiling taxa compositions and gene catalogues and identifying their associations with human health. Less attention has been paid to the analysis of the ecosystems of microbiomes themselves especially their CRISPR composition.	We conducted a preliminary analysis of CRISPR sequences in a human gut metagenomic data set of Chinese individuals of type-2 diabetes patients and healthy controls. Applying an available CRISPR-identification algorithm, PILER-CR, we identified 3169 CRISPR cassettes in the data, from which we constructed a set of 1302 unique repeat sequences and 36,709 spacers. A more extensive analysis was made for the CRISPR repeats: these repeats were submitted to a more comprehensive clustering and classification using the web server tool CRISPRmap. All repeats were compared with known CRISPRs in the database CRISPRdb. A total of 784 repeats had matches in the database, and the remaining 518 repeats from our set are potentially novel ones.	The computational analysis of CRISPR composition based contigs of metagenome sequencing data is feasible. It provides an efficient approach for finding potential novel CRISPR arrays and for analysing the ecosystem and history of human microbiomes.	TC Mangericao|Z Peng|X Zhang
26818534	The precise engineering of proteins in bacteria via the amber codon has been hampered by the poor incorporation of unnatural amino acid (UAA). Here we explored the amber assignment as a sense codon for UAA by CRISPRi targeting release factor 1 (RF1). Scanning of RF1 gene with sgRNAs identified target loci that differentiate RF1 repressions. Quantitation of RF1 repressions versus UAA incorporation indicated an increasing interrelation with the amber reassignment maximized upon RF1 knockdown to ~30%, disclosing the beneficial role of RF1 in amber assignment. However, further RF1 repression reversed this trend resulting from the detrimental effects on host cell growth, disclosing the harmful aspect of RF1 in reassignment of the amber codon. Our data indicate RF1 as a switch manipulating genetic code expansion and pave a direction via CRISPRi for precise engineering and efficient production of proteins in bacteria.

The prokaryotic clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) system, recently harnessed for transcriptional regulation in various heterologous host cells, offers unprecedented ease in designing synthetic TFs.

26787519	The goal of gene therapy is to introduce foreign genes into human target cells in a certain way to correct or compensate diseases caused by defective or abnormal genes. Therefore, gene therapy has great practical significance in studying the treatment of persistent or latent HIV-1 infection. At present, the existing methods of gene therapy have some major defects such as limited target site recognition and high frequency of off-targets. The latest research showed that the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) /CRISPR-associated nuclease 9 (Cas9) system from bacteria and archaea has been successfully reformed to a targeted genome editing tool. Thus, how to achieve the goal of treating HIV-1 infection by modifying targeted HIV-1 virus genome effectively using the CRISPR/Cas9 system has become a current research focus. Here we review the latest achievements worldwide and briefly introduce applications of the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology in the treatment of HIV-1 infection, including CCR5 gene editing, removal of HIV-1 virus and activation of HIV-1 virus, in order to provide reference for the prevention and treatment of HIV-1 infection.

26787518	The CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein-9 nuclease) genome editing technology has become more and more popular in gene editing because of its simple design and easy operation. Using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, researchers can perform site-directed genome modification at the base level. Moreover, it has been widely used in genome editing in multiple species and related cancer research. In this review, we summarize the application of the CRISPR/Cas9 system in cancer research based on the latest research progresses as well as our understanding of cancer research and genome editing techniques.

26786405	The CRISPR-Cas system is a powerful tool for generating genetically modified animals; however, targeted knock-in (KI) via homologous recombination remains difficult in zygotes. Here we show efficient gene KI in rats by combining CRISPR-Cas with single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides (ssODNs). First, a 1-kb ssODN co-injected with guide RNA (gRNA) and Cas9 messenger RNA produce GFP-KI at the rat Thy1 locus. Then, two gRNAs with two 80-bp ssODNs direct efficient integration of a 5.5-kb CAG-GFP vector into the Rosa26 locus via ssODN-mediated end joining. This protocol also achieves KI of a 200-kb BAC containing the human SIRPA locus, concomitantly knocking out the rat Sirpa gene. Finally, three gRNAs and two ssODNs replace 58-kb of the rat Cyp2d cluster with a 6.2-kb human CYP2D6 gene. These ssODN-mediated KI protocols can be applied to any target site with any donor vector without the need to construct homology arms, thus simplifying genome engineering in living organisms.

26782778	The recently emerged CRISPR/Cas9 technique has opened a new perspective on readily editing specific genes. When combined with transcription activators, it can precisely manipulate endogenous gene expression. Here, we enhanced the expression of endogenous Cdx2 and Gata6 genes by CRISPR-mediated activators, thus mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) were directly converted into two extraembryonic lineages, i.e., typical trophoblast stem cells (TSCs) and extraembryonic endoderm cells (XENCs), which exhibited characters of TSC or XENC derived from the blastocyst extraembryonic lineages such as cell morphology, specific gene expression, and differentiation ability in vitro and in vivo. This study demonstrates that the cell fate can be effectively manipulated by directly activating of specific endogenous gene expression with CRISPR-mediated activator.

26782639	The clustered regularly-interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated (Cas) system from Streptococcus pyogenes (Spy) has been successfully adapted for RNA-guided genome editing in a wide range of organisms. However, numerous reports have indicated that Spy CRISPR-Cas9 systems may have significant off-target cleavage of genomic DNA sequences differing from the intended on-target site. Here, we report the performance of the Neisseria meningitidis (Nme) CRISPR-Cas9 system that requires a longer protospacer-adjacent motif for site-specific cleavage, and present a comparison between the Spy and Nme CRISPR-Cas9 systems targeting the same protospacer sequence. The results with the native crRNA and tracrRNA as well as a chimeric single guide RNA for the Nme CRISPR-Cas9 system were also compared. Our results suggest that, compared with the Spy system, the Nme CRISPR-Cas9 system has similar or lower on-target cleavage activity but a reduced overall off-target effect on a genomic level when sites containing three or fewer mismatches are considered. Thus, the Nme CRISPR-Cas9 system may represent a safer alternative for precision genome engineering applications.	CM Lee|TJ Cradick|G Bao
26772411	Bacteria occur ubiquitously in nature and are broadly relevant throughout the food supply chain, with diverse and variable tolerance levels depending on their origin, biological role, and impact on the quality and safety of the product as well as on the health of the consumer. With increasing knowledge of and accessibility to the microbial composition of our environments, food supply, and host-associated microbiota, our understanding of and appreciation for the ratio of beneficial to undesirable bacteria are rapidly evolving. Therefore, there is a need for tools and technologies that allow definite, accurate, and high-resolution identification and typing of various groups of bacteria that include beneficial microbes such as starter cultures and probiotics, innocuous commensals, and undesirable pathogens and spoilage organisms. During the transition from the current molecular biology-based PFGE (pulsed-field gel electrophoresis) gold standard to the increasingly accessible omics-level whole-genome sequencing (WGS) N-gen standard, high-resolution technologies such as CRISPR-based genotyping constitute practical and powerful alternatives that provide valuable insights into genome microevolution and evolutionary trajectories. Indeed, several studies have shown potential for CRISPR-based typing of industrial starter cultures, health-promoting probiotic strains, animal commensal species, and problematic pathogens. Emerging CRISPR-based typing methods open new avenues for high-resolution typing of a broad range of bacteria and constitute a practical means for rapid tracking of a diversity of food-associated microbes.

26764427	Casposons are a superfamily of putative self-synthesizing transposable elements that are predicted to employ a homolog of Cas1 protein as a recombinase and could have contributed to the origin of the CRISPR-Cas adaptive immunity systems in archaea and bacteria. Casposons remain uncharacterized experimentally, except for the recent demonstration of the integrase activity of the Cas1 homolog, and given their relative rarity in archaea and bacteria, original comparative genomic analysis has not provided direct indications of their mobility. Here, we report evidence of casposon mobility obtained by comparison of the genomes of 62 strains of the archaeon Methanosarcina mazei. In these genomes, casposons are variably inserted in three distinct sites indicative of multiple, recent gains, and losses. Some casposons are inserted into other mobile genetic elements that might provide vehicles for horizontal transfer of the casposons. Additionally, many M. mazei genomes contain previously undetected solo terminal inverted repeats that apparently are derived from casposons and could resemble intermediates in CRISPR evolution. We further demonstrate the sequence specificity of casposon insertion and note clear parallels with the adaptation mechanism of CRISPR-Cas. Finally, besides identifying additional representatives in each of the three originally defined families, we describe a new, fourth, family of casposons.

26764007	TRIM5α is an interferon-inducible retroviral restriction factor that prevents infection by inducing the abortive disassembly of capsid cores recognized by its C-terminal PRY/SPRY domain. The mechanism by which TRIM5α mediates the disassembly of viral cores is poorly understood. Previous studies demonstrated that proteasome inhibitors abrogate the ability of TRIM5α to induce premature core disassembly and prevent reverse transcription; however, viral infection is still inhibited, indicating that the proteasome is partially involved in the restriction process. Alternatively, we and others have observed that TRIM5α associates with proteins involved in autophagic degradation pathways, and one recent study found that autophagic degradation is required for the restriction of retroviruses by TRIM5α. Here, we show that TRIM5α is basally degraded via autophagy in the absence of restriction-sensitive virus. We observe that the autophagy markers LC3b and lysosome-associated membrane protein 2A (LAMP2A) localize to a subset of TRIM5α cytoplasmic bodies, and inhibition of lysosomal degradation with bafilomycin A1 increases this association. To test the requirement for macroautophagy in restriction, we examined the ability of TRIM5α to restrict retroviral infection in cells depleted of the autophagic mediators ATG5, Beclin1, and p62. In all cases, restriction of retroviruses by human TRIM5α, rhesus macaque TRIM5α, and owl monkey TRIM-Cyp remained potent in cells depleted of these autophagic effectors by small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown or clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas9 genome editing. Collectively, these results are consistent with observations that the turnover of TRIM5α proteins is sensitive to autophagy inhibition; however, the data presented here do not support observations that the inhibition of autophagy abrogates retroviral restriction by TRIM5 proteins.	Restriction factors are a class of proteins that inhibit viral replication. Following fusion of a retrovirus with a host cell membrane, the retroviral capsid is released into the cytoplasm of the target cell. TRIM5α inhibits retroviral infection by promoting the abortive disassembly of incoming retroviral capsid cores; as a result, the retroviral genome is unable to traffic to the nucleus, and the viral life cycle is extinguished. In the process of restriction, TRIM5α itself is degraded by the proteasome. However, in the present study, we have shown that in the absence of a restriction-sensitive virus, TRIM5α is degraded by both proteasomal and autophagic degradation pathways. Notably, we observed that restriction of retroviruses by TRIM5α does not require autophagic machinery. These data indicate that the effector functions of TRIM5α can be separated from its degradation and may have further implications for understanding the mechanisms of other TRIM family members.

26763997	The field of viral metagenomics has expanded our understanding of viral diversity from all three domains of life (Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya). Traditionally, viral metagenomic studies provide information about viral gene content but rarely provide knowledge about virion morphology and/or cellular host identity. Here we describe a new virus, Acidianus tailed spindle virus (ATSV), initially identified by bioinformatic analysis of viral metagenomic data sets from a high-temperature (80°C) acidic (pH 2) hot spring located in Yellowstone National Park, followed by more detailed characterization using only environmental samples without dependency on culturing. Characterization included the identification of the large tailed spindle virion morphology, determination of the complete 70.8-kb circular double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viral genome content, and identification of its cellular host. Annotation of the ATSV genome revealed a potential three-domain gene product containing an N-terminal leucine-rich repeat domain, followed by a likely posttranslation regulatory region consisting of high serine and threonine content, and a C-terminal ESCRT-III domain, suggesting interplay with the host ESCRT system. The host of ATSV, which is most closely related to Acidianus hospitalis, was determined by a combination of analysis of cellular clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas loci and dual viral and cellular fluorescence in situ hybridization (viral FISH) analysis of environmental samples and confirmed by culture-based infection studies. This work provides an expanded pathway for the discovery, isolation, and characterization of new viruses using culture-independent approaches and provides a platform for predicting and confirming virus hosts.	Virus discovery and characterization have been traditionally accomplished by using culture-based methods. While a valuable approach, it is limited by the availability of culturable hosts. In this research, we report a virus-centered approach to virus discovery and characterization, linking viral metagenomic sequences to a virus particle, its sequenced genome, and its host directly in environmental samples, without using culture-dependent methods. This approach provides a pathway for the discovery, isolation, and characterization of new viruses. While this study used an acidic hot spring environment to characterize a new archaeal virus, Acidianus tailed spindle virus (ATSV), the approach can be generally applied to any environment to expand knowledge of virus diversity in all three domains of life.

26763118	Prokaryotic CRISPR-Cas systems provide an RNA-guided mechanism for genome defense against mobile genetic elements such as viruses and plasmids. In type III-A CRISPR-Cas systems, the RNA-guided multisubunit Csm effector complex targets both single-stranded RNAs and double-stranded DNAs. In addition to the Csm complex, efficient anti-plasmid immunity mediated by type III-A systems also requires the CRISPR-associated protein Csm6. Here we report the crystal structure of Csm6 from Thermus thermophilus and show that the protein is a ssRNA-specific endoribonuclease. The structure reveals a dimeric architecture generated by interactions involving the N-terminal CARF and C-terminal HEPN domains. HEPN domain dimerization leads to the formation of a composite ribonuclease active site. Consistently, mutations of invariant active site residues impair catalytic activity in vitro. We further show that the ribonuclease activity of Csm6 is conserved across orthologs, suggesting that it plays an important functional role in CRISPR-Cas systems. The dimer interface of the CARF domains features a conserved electropositive pocket that may function as a ligand-binding site for allosteric control of ribonuclease activity. Altogether, our work suggests that Csm6 proteins provide an auxiliary RNA-targeting interference mechanism in type III-A CRISPR-Cas systems that operates in conjunction with the RNA- and DNA-targeting endonuclease activities of the Csm effector complex.

26762978	The CRISPR/Cas9 system facilitates precise DNA modifications by generating RNA-guided blunt-ended double-strand breaks. We demonstrate that guide RNA pairs generate deletions that are repaired with a high level of precision by non-homologous end-joining in mammalian cells. We present a method called knock-in blunt ligation for exploiting these breaks to insert exogenous PCR-generated sequences in a homology-independent manner without loss of additional nucleotides. This method is useful for making precise additions to the genome such as insertions of marker gene cassettes or functional elements, without the need for homology arms. We successfully utilized this method in human and mouse cells to insert fluorescent protein cassettes into various loci, with efficiencies up to 36% in HEK293 cells without selection. We also created versions of Cas9 fused to the FKBP12-L106P destabilization domain in an effort to improve Cas9 performance. Our in vivo blunt-end cloning method and destabilization-domain-fused Cas9 variant increase the repertoire of precision genome engineering approaches.

26762955	Technological advances are important for innovative biological research. Development of molecular tools for DNA manipulation, such as zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and the clustered regularly-interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas), has revolutionized genome editing. These approaches can be used to develop potential therapeutic strategies to effectively treat heritable diseases. In the last few years, substantial progress has been made in CRISPR/Cas technology, including technical improvements and wide application in many model systems. This review describes recent advancements in genome editing with a particular focus on CRISPR/Cas, covering the underlying principles, technological optimization, and its application in zebrafish and other model organisms, disease modeling, and gene therapy used for personalized medicine.

26759047	Acute tubular necrosis causes a loss of renal function, which clinically presents as acute kidney failure (AKI). The biochemical signaling pathways that trigger necrosis have been investigated in detail over the past 5 years. It is now clear that necrosis (regulated necrosis, RN) represents a genetically driven process that contributes to the pathophysiology of AKI. RN pathways such as necroptosis, ferroptosis, parthanatos, and mitochondrial permeability transition-induced regulated necrosis (MPT-RN) may be mechanistically distinct, and the relative contributions to overall organ damage during AKI in living organisms largely remain elusive. In a synchronized manner, some necrotic programs induce the breakdown of tubular segments and multicellular functional units, whereas others are limited to killing single cells in the tubular compartment. Importantly, the means by which a renal cell dies may have implications for the subsequent inflammatory response. In this review, the recent advances in the field of renal cell death in AKI and key enzymes that might serve as novel therapeutic targets will be discussed. As a consequence of the interference with RN, the immunogenicity of dying cells in AKI in renal transplants will be diminished, rendering inhibitors of RN indirect immunosuppressive agents.

26755636	The CRISPR/Cas technology enables targeted genome editing and the rapid generation of transgenic animal models for the study of human genetic disorders. Here we describe an autosomal recessive human disease in two unrelated families characterized by a split-foot defect, nail abnormalities of the hands, and hearing loss, due to mutations disrupting the SAM domain of the protein kinase ZAK. ZAK is a member of the MAPKKK family with no known role in limb development. We show that Zak is expressed in the developing limbs and that a CRISPR/Cas-mediated knockout of the two Zak isoforms is embryonically lethal in mice. In contrast, a deletion of the SAM domain induces a complex hindlimb defect associated with down-regulation of Trp63, a known split-hand/split-foot malformation disease gene. Our results identify ZAK as a key player in mammalian limb patterning and demonstrate the rapid utility of CRISPR/Cas genome editing to assign causality to human mutations in the mouse in <10 wk.

26755436	Programmable DNA nucleases such as TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 are emerging as powerful tools for genome editing. Dual-fluorescent surrogate systems have been demonstrated by several studies to recapitulate DNA nuclease activity and enrich for genetically edited cells. In this study, we created a single-strand annealing-directed, dual-fluorescent surrogate reporter system, referred to as C-Check. We opted for the Golden Gate Cloning strategy to simplify C-Check construction. To demonstrate the utility of the C-Check system, we used the C-Check in combination with TALENs or CRISPR/Cas9 in different scenarios of gene editing experiments. First, we disrupted the endogenous pIAPP gene (3.0 % efficiency) by C-Check-validated TALENs in primary porcine fibroblasts (PPFs). Next, we achieved gene-editing efficiencies of 9.0-20.3 and 4.9 % when performing single- and double-gene targeting (MAPT and SORL1), respectively, in PPFs using C-Check-validated CRISPR/Cas9 vectors. Third, fluorescent tagging of endogenous genes (MYH6 and COL2A1, up to 10.0 % frequency) was achieved in human fibroblasts with C-Check-validated CRISPR/Cas9 vectors. We further demonstrated that the C-Check system could be applied to enrich for IGF1R null HEK293T cells and CBX5 null MCF-7 cells with frequencies of nearly 100.0 and 86.9 %, respectively. Most importantly, we further showed that the C-Check system is compatible with multiplexing and for studying CRISPR/Cas9 sgRNA specificity. The C-Check system may serve as an alternative dual-fluorescent surrogate tool for measuring DNA nuclease activity and enrichment of gene-edited cells, and may thereby aid in streamlining programmable DNA nuclease-mediated genome editing and biological research.

26751509	Since the first demonstration that CRISPR-Cas systems provide bacteria and archaea with adaptive immunity against phages and plasmids, numerous studies have yielded key insights into the molecular mechanisms governing how these systems attack and degrade foreign DNA. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the adaptation stage, in which new immunological memory is formed, have until recently represented a major unresolved question. In this Progress article, we discuss recent discoveries that have shown both how foreign DNA is identified by the CRISPR-Cas adaptation machinery and the molecular basis for its integration into the chromosome to form an immunological memory. Furthermore, we describe the roles of each of the specific CRISPR-Cas components that are involved in memory formation, and consider current models for their evolutionary origin.	G Amitai|R Sorek

26741827	"Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus" (CLas) is an uncultureable α-proteobacterium associated with citrus Huanglongbing (HLB, yellow shoot disease), a highly destructive disease affecting citrus production worldwide. HLB was observed in Guangdong Province of China over a hundred years ago and remains endemic there. Little is known about CLas biology due to its uncultureable nature. This study began with the genome sequence analysis of CLas Strain A4 from Guangdong in the prophage region. Within the two currently known prophage types, Type 1 (SC1-like) and Type 2 (SC2-like), A4 genome contained only a Type 2 prophage, CGdP2, namely. An analysis on CLas strains collected in Guangdong showed that Type 2 prophage dominated the bacterial population (82.6%, 71/86). An extended survey covering five provinces in southern China also revealed the predominance of single prophage (Type 1 or Type 2) in the CLas population (90.4%, 169/187). CLas strains with two and no prophage types accounted for 7.2% and 2.8%, respectively. In silico analyses on CGdP2 identified a CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/cas (CRISPR-associated protein genes) system, consisting of four 22 bp repeats, three 23 bp spacers and 9 predicted cas. Similar CRISPR/cas systems were detected in all 10 published CLas prophages as well as 13 CLas field strains in southern China. Both Type 1 and Type 2 prophages shared almost identical sequences in spacer 1 and 3 but not spacer 2. Considering that the function of a CRISPR/cas system was to destroy invading DNA, it was hypothesized that a pre-established CLas prophage could use its CRISPR/cas system guided by spacer 1 and/or 3 to defeat the invasion of the other phage/prophage. This hypothesis explained the predominance of single prophage type in the CLas population in southern China. This is the first report of CRISPR/cas system in the "Ca. Liberibacter" genera.

26740581	In order to elucidate the functional organization of the genome, it is vital to directly visualize the interactions between genomic elements in living cells. For this purpose, we engineered the Cas9 protein from Staphylococcus aureus (SaCas9) for the imaging of endogenous genomic loci, which showed a similar robustness and efficiency as previously reported for Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9). Imaging readouts allowed us to characterize the DNA-binding activity of SaCas9 and to optimize its sgRNA scaffold. Combining SaCas9 and SpCas9, we demonstrated two-color CRISPR imaging with the capability to resolve genomic loci spaced by <300 kb. Combinatorial color-mixing further enabled us to code multiple genomic elements in the same cell. Our results highlight the potential of combining SpCas9 and SaCas9 for multiplexed CRISPR-Cas9 applications, such as imaging and genome engineering.

26735016	CRISPR-Cas9 nucleases are widely used for genome editing but can induce unwanted off-target mutations. Existing strategies for reducing genome-wide off-target effects of the widely used Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) are imperfect, possessing only partial or unproven efficacies and other limitations that constrain their use. Here we describe SpCas9-HF1, a high-fidelity variant harbouring alterations designed to reduce non-specific DNA contacts. SpCas9-HF1 retains on-target activities comparable to wild-type SpCas9 with >85% of single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) tested in human cells. Notably, with sgRNAs targeted to standard non-repetitive sequences, SpCas9-HF1 rendered all or nearly all off-target events undetectable by genome-wide break capture and targeted sequencing methods. Even for atypical, repetitive target sites, the vast majority of off-target mutations induced by wild-type SpCas9 were not detected with SpCas9-HF1. With its exceptional precision, SpCas9-HF1 provides an alternative to wild-type SpCas9 for research and therapeutic applications. More broadly, our results suggest a general strategy for optimizing genome-wide specificities of other CRISPR-RNA-guided nucleases.

26731440	Mutations in SCN1A, the gene encoding the α subunit of Nav1.1 channel, can cause epilepsies with wide ranges of clinical phenotypes, which are associated with the contrasting effects of channel loss-of-function or gain-of-function. In this project, CRISPR/Cas9- and TALEN-mediated genome-editing techniques were applied to induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based-disease model to explore the mechanism of epilepsy caused by SCN1A loss-of-function mutation. By fluorescently labeling GABAergic subtype in iPSC-derived neurons using CRISPR/Cas9, we for the first time performed electrophysiological studies on SCN1A-expressing neural subtype and monitored the postsynaptic activity of both inhibitory and excitatory types. We found that the mutation c.A5768G, which led to no current of Nav1.1 in exogenously transfected system, influenced the properties of not only Nav current amount, but also Nav activation in Nav1.1-expressing GABAergic neurons. The two alterations in Nav further reduced the amplitudes and enhanced the thresholds of action potential in patient-derived GABAergic neurons, and led to weakened spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) in the patient-derived neuronal network. Although the spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) did not change significantly, when the frequencies of both sIPSCs and sEPSCs were further analyzed, we found the whole postsynaptic activity transferred from the inhibition-dominated state to excitation in patient-derived neuronal networks, suggesting that changes in sIPSCs alone were sufficient to significantly reverse the excitatory level of spontaneous postsynaptic activity. In summary, our findings fill the gap of our knowledge regarding the relationship between SCN1A mutation effect recorded on exogenously transfected cells and on Nav1.1-expressing neurons, and reveal the physiological basis underlying epileptogenesis caused by SCN1A loss-of-function mutation.

26729914	CRISPR interference/activation (CRISPRi/a) technology provides a simple and efficient approach for targeted repression or activation of gene expression in the mammalian genome. It is highly flexible and programmable, using an RNA-guided nuclease-deficient Cas9 (dCas9) protein fused with transcriptional regulators for targeting specific genes to effect their regulation. Multiple studies have shown how this method is an effective way to achieve efficient and specific transcriptional repression or activation of single or multiple genes. Sustained transcriptional modulation can be obtained by stable expression of CRISPR components, which enables directed reprogramming of cell fate. Here, we introduce the basics of CRISPRi/a technology for genome repression or activation.	D Du|LS Qi
26729910	Targeted modulation of transcription is necessary for understanding complex gene networks and has great potential for medical and industrial applications. CRISPR is emerging as a powerful system for targeted genome activation and repression, in addition to its use in genome editing. This protocol describes how to design, construct, and experimentally validate the function of sequence-specific single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) for sequence-specific repression (CRISPRi) or activation (CRISPRa) of transcription in mammalian cells. In this technology, the CRISPR-associated protein Cas9 is catalytically deactivated (dCas9) to provide a general platform for RNA-guided DNA targeting of any locus in the genome. Fusion of dCas9 to effector domains with distinct regulatory functions enables stable and efficient transcriptional repression or activation in mammalian cells. Delivery of multiple sgRNAs further enables activation or repression of multiple genes. By using scaffold RNAs (scRNAs), different effectors can be recruited to different genes for simultaneous activation of some and repression of others. The CRISPRi and CRISPRa methods provide powerful tools for sequence-specific control of gene expression on a genome-wide scale to aid understanding gene functions and for engineering genetic regulatory systems.

26721686	Frame-disrupting mutations in the DMD gene, encoding dystrophin, compromise myofiber integrity and drive muscle deterioration in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Removing one or more exons from the mutated transcript can produce an in-frame mRNA and a truncated, but still functional, protein. In this study, we developed and tested a direct gene-editing approach to induce exon deletion and recover dystrophin expression in the mdx mouse model of DMD. Delivery by adeno-associated virus (AAV) of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 endonucleases coupled with paired guide RNAs flanking the mutated Dmd exon23 resulted in excision of intervening DNA and restored the Dmd reading frame in myofibers, cardiomyocytes, and muscle stem cells after local or systemic delivery. AAV-Dmd CRISPR treatment partially recovered muscle functional deficiencies and generated a pool of endogenously corrected myogenic precursors in mdx mouse muscle.

26721684	Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a devastating disease affecting about 1 out of 5000 male births and caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene. Genome editing has the potential to restore expression of a modified dystrophin gene from the native locus to modulate disease progression. In this study, adeno-associated virus was used to deliver the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 system to the mdx mouse model of DMD to remove the mutated exon 23 from the dystrophin gene. This includes local and systemic delivery to adult mice and systemic delivery to neonatal mice. Exon 23 deletion by CRISPR-Cas9 resulted in expression of the modified dystrophin gene, partial recovery of functional dystrophin protein in skeletal myofibers and cardiac muscle, improvement of muscle biochemistry, and significant enhancement of muscle force. This work establishes CRISPR-Cas9-based genome editing as a potential therapy to treat DMD.

26721433	Drosophila suzukii (commonly called spotted wing Drosophila) is an invasive pest of soft-skinned fruit (e.g. blueberries, strawberries). A high quality reference genome sequence is available but functional genomic tools, such as used in Drosophila melanogaster, remain to be developed. In this study we have used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to introduce site-specific mutations in the D. suzukii white (w) and Sex lethal (Sxl) genes. Hemizygous males with w mutations develop white eyes and the mutant genes are transmissible to the next generation. Somatic mosaic females that carry mutations in the Sxl gene develop abnormal genitalia and reproductive tissue. The D. suzukii Sxl gene could be an excellent target for a Cas9-mediated gene drive to suppress populations of this highly destructive pest.	F Li|MJ Scott
26716561	The simplicity of site-specific genome targeting by type II clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas9 nucleases, along with their robust activity profile, has changed the landscape of genome editing. These favorable properties have made the CRISPR-Cas9 system the technology of choice for sequence-specific modifications in vertebrate systems. For many applications, whether the focus is on basic science investigations or therapeutic efficacy, activity and precision are important considerations when one is choosing a nuclease platform, target site and delivery method. Here we review recent methods for increasing the activity and accuracy of Cas9 and assessing the extent of off-target cleavage events.	MF Bolukbasi|A Gupta|SA Wolfe
26714547	To detect the molecular characteristics of Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeat (CRISPR) in Shigella and to analyze the distribution of CRISPR related to the time of isolation.	Of the 52 Shigella strains, 41 were isolated from Henan, 6 from Jiangxi and 5 isolated from Beijing. Both CRISPR locus of S1, S2, S3 and S4 in Shigella were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR products were sequenced and compared.	The positive rates of CRISPR locus in Shigella were 33.69% (S1), 50.00% (S2), 82.69% (S3) and 73.08% (S4), respectively. Two subtypes were discovered in S1 and S3 locus. Three subtypes were discovered in S2 locus. Four different subtypes were discovered in S4 locus. The isolates from Henan strains were divided into two groups by the time of isolation. Distributions of S1 were different, before or after 2004, on Shigella. S1 could not be detected after 2004. There were no statistical differences of S2, S3 and S4 in two groups.	Different CRISPR subtypes or Shigella were discovered. A significant correlation was noticed between the CRISPR S1 related to the time of isolation but not between S2, S3 or S4 on the time of isolation.	Z Xue|Y Wang|G Duan|H Yang|Y Xi|P Wang|L Wang|X Guo
26710228	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) are the bacterial adaptive immune system against foreign nucleic acids. Given the variable nature of CRISPR, it could be a good marker for molecular epidemiology. Group A streptococcus is one of the major human pathogens. It has two CRISPR loci, including CRISPR01 and CRISPR02. The aim of this study was to analyze the distribution of CRISPR-associated gene cassettes (cas) and CRISPR arrays in highly prevalent emm types. The cas cassette and CRISPR array in two CRISPR loci were analyzed in a total of 332 strains, including emm1, emm3, emm4, emm12, and emm28 strains. The CRISPR type was defined by the spacer content of each CRISPR array. All strains had at least one cas cassette or CRISPR array. More than 90% of the spacers were found in one emm type, specifically. Comparing the consistency between emm and CRISPR types by Simpson's index of diversity and the adjusted Wallace coefficient, CRISPR01 type was concordant to emm type, and CRISPR02 showed unidirectional congruence to emm type, suggesting that at least for the majority of isolates causing infection in high income countries, the emm type can be inferred from CRISPR analysis, which can further discriminate isolates sharing the same emm type.

26707540	One of the key drivers for successful metabolic engineering in microbes is the efficacy by which genomes can be edited. As such there are many methods to choose from when aiming to modify genomes, especially those of model organisms like yeast and bacteria. In recent years, clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and its associated proteins (Cas) have become the method of choice for precision genome engineering in many organisms due to their orthogonality, versatility and efficacy. Here we review the strategies adopted for implementation of RNA-guided CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing with special emphasis on their application for metabolic engineering of yeast and bacteria. Also, examples of how nuclease-deficient Cas9 has been applied for RNA-guided transcriptional regulation of target genes will be reviewed, as well as tools available for computer-aided design of guide-RNAs will be highlighted. Finally, this review will provide a perspective on the immediate challenges and opportunities foreseen by the use of CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering and regulation in the context of metabolic engineering.

26704949	The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) is a widespread adaptive immunity system that exists in most archaea and many bacteria against foreign DNA, such as phages, viruses and plasmids. In general, CRISPR system consists of direct repeat, leader, spacer and CRISPR-associated sequences. Acetic acid bacteria (AAB) play an important role in industrial fermentation of vinegar and bioelectrochemistry. To investigate the polymorphism and evolution pattern of CRISPR loci in acetic acid bacteria, bioinformatic analyses were performed on 48 species from three main genera (Acetobacter, Gluconacetobacter and Gluconobacter) with whole genome sequences available from the NCBI database. The results showed that the CRISPR system existed in 32 species of the 48 strains studied. Most of the CRISPR-Cas system in AAB belonged to type I CRISPR-Cas system (subtype E and C), but type II CRISPR-Cas system which contain cas9 gene was only found in the genus Acetobacter and Gluconacetobacter. The repeat sequences of some CRISPR were highly conserved among species from different genera, and the leader sequences of some CRISPR possessed conservative motif, which was associated with regulated promoters. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis of cas1 demonstrated that they were suitable for classification of species. The conservation of cas1 genes was associated with that of repeat sequences among different strains, suggesting they were subjected to similar functional constraints. Moreover, the number of spacer was positively correlated with the number of prophages and insertion sequences, indicating the acetic acid bacteria were continually invaded by new foreign DNA. The comparative analysis of CRISR loci in acetic acid bacteria provided the basis for investigating the molecular mechanism of different acetic acid tolerance and genome stability in acetic acid bacteria.

26704531	Collimonas is a genus belonging to the class of Betaproteobacteria and consists mostly of soil bacteria with the ability to exploit living fungi as food source (mycophagy). Collimonas strains differ in a range of activities, including swimming motility, quorum sensing, extracellular protease activity, siderophore production, and antimicrobial activities.	In order to reveal ecological traits possibly related to Collimonas lifestyle and secondary metabolites production, we performed a comparative genomics analysis based on whole-genome sequencing of six strains representing 3 recognized species. The analysis revealed that the core genome represents 43.1 to 52.7% of the genomes of the six individual strains. These include genes coding for extracellular enzymes (chitinase, peptidase, phospholipase), iron acquisition and type II secretion systems. In the variable genome, differences were found in genes coding for secondary metabolites (e.g. tripropeptin A and volatile terpenes), several unknown orphan polyketide synthase-nonribosomal peptide synthetase (PKS-NRPS), nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene clusters, a new lipopeptide and type III and type VI secretion systems. Potential roles of the latter genes in the interaction with other organisms were investigated. Mutation of a gene involved in tripropeptin A biosynthesis strongly reduced the antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, while disruption of a gene involved in the biosynthesis of the new lipopeptide had a large effect on the antifungal/oomycetal activities.	Overall our results indicated that Collimonas genomes harbour many genes encoding for novel enzymes and secondary metabolites (including terpenes) important for interactions with other organisms and revealed genomic plasticity, which reflect the behaviour, antimicrobial activity and lifestylesof Collimonas spp.	C Song|R Schmidt|V de Jager|D Krzyzanowska|E Jongedijk|K Cankar|J Beekwilder|A van Veen|W de Boer|JA van Veen|P Garbeva
26702668	To investigate the effect of the fibronectin extra domain A on the aggressiveness of salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma (SACC) cells, via the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/ associated proteins (Cas) system.	One sgRNA was designed to target the upstream of the genome sequences of extra domain A(EDA) exon and the downstream. Then the sgRNA was linked into plasmid PX-330 and transfected into SACC-83 cells. PCR and DNA sequence were used to testify the knockout cells, and the monoclones of EDA absent SACC cells were selected (A+C-2, A+C-6, B+C-10). CCK-8 cell proliferation and invasion was then tested in control group and the experimental group.	The sgRNA was successfully linked into PX-330 plasmid. Part of adenoid cystic carcinoma cells' SACC-83 genomic EDA exon was knocked out, and the knockdown efficiency was above 70%, but the total amount of fibronectin did not change significantly. Three monoclones of EDA absent SACC- 83 cells were successfully selected with diminished migration and proliferation.	The CRISPR/Cas9 system was a simplified system with relatively high knockout efficiency and EDA knockout could inhibiting SACC cell's mobility and invasiveness.	Y Yang|H Wang|S Xu|J Peng|J Jiang|C Li
26701310	Coupling the tools of synthetic biology with traditional molecular genetic techniques can enable the rapid prototyping and optimization of yeast strains. While the era of yeast synthetic biology began in the well-characterized model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae, it is swiftly expanding to include non-conventional yeast production systems such as Hansenula polymorpha, Kluyveromyces lactis, Pichia pastoris, and Yarrowia lipolytica. These yeasts already have roles in the manufacture of vaccines, therapeutic proteins, food additives, and biorenewable chemicals, but recent synthetic biology advances have the potential to greatly expand and diversify their impact on biotechnology. In this review, we summarize the development of synthetic biological tools (including promoters and terminators) and enabling molecular genetics approaches that have been applied in these four promising alternative biomanufacturing platforms. An emphasis is placed on synthetic parts and genome editing tools. Finally, we discuss examples of synthetic tools developed in other organisms that can be adapted or optimized for these hosts in the near future.	JM Wagner|HS Alper
26698412	Genome editing technologies represent a major breakthrough that has dramatically altered strategies in a wide range of biological studies.

26687626	Crustaceans possess a diverse array of specialized limbs. Although shifts in Hox gene expression domains have been postulated to play a role in generating this limb diversity, little functional data have been provided to understand the precise roles of Hox genes during crustacean development. We used a combination of CRISPR/Cas9-targeted mutagenesis and RNAi knockdown to decipher the function of the six Hox genes expressed in the developing mouth and trunk of the amphipod Parhyale hawaiensis. These experimentally manipulated animals display specific and striking homeotic transformations. We found that abdominal-A (abd-A) and Abdominal-B (Abd-B) are required for proper posterior patterning, with knockout of Abd-B resulting in an animal with thoracic type legs along what would have been an abdomen, and abd-A disruption generating a simplified body plan characterized by a loss of specialization in both abdominal and thoracic appendages. In the thorax, Ubx is necessary for gill development and for repression of gnathal fate, and Antp dictates claw morphology. In the mouth, Scr and Antp confer the part-gnathal, part-thoracic hybrid identity of the maxilliped, and Scr and Dfd prevent antennal identity in posterior head segments. Our results allow us to define the role Hox genes play in specifying each appendage type in Parhyale, including the modular nature by which some appendages are patterned by Hox gene inputs. In addition, we define how changes in Hox gene expression have generated morphological differences between crustacean species. Finally, we also highlight the utility of CRISPR/Cas9-based somatic mutagenesis in emerging model organisms.	A Martin|JM Serano|E Jarvis|HS Bruce|J Wang|S Ray|CA Barker|LC O'Connell|NH Patel
26686765	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) has arisen as a frontrunner for efficient genome engineering. However, the potentially broad therapeutic implications are largely unexplored. Here, to investigate the therapeutic potential of CRISPR/Cas9 in a diverse set of genetic disorders, we establish a pipeline that uses readily obtainable cells from affected individuals. We show that an adapted version of CRISPR/Cas9 increases the amount of utrophin, a known disease modifier in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Furthermore, we demonstrate preferential elimination of the dominant-negative FGFR3 c.1138G>A allele in fibroblasts of an individual affected by achondroplasia. Using a previously undescribed approach involving single guide RNA, we successfully removed large genome rearrangement in primary cells of an individual with an X chromosome duplication including MECP2. Moreover, removal of a duplication of DMD exons 18-30 in myotubes of an individual affected by DMD produced full-length dystrophin. Our findings establish the far-reaching therapeutic utility of CRISPR/Cas9, which can be tailored to target numerous inherited disorders.

26677816	It is possible to target individual sequence motives within genomes by using synthetic DNA-binding domains. This one-dimensional approach has been used successfully in plants to induce mutations or for the transcriptional regulation of single genes. When the CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas9 system was discovered, a tool became available allowing the extension of this approach from one to three dimensions and to construct at least partly synthetic entities on the genome, epigenome and transcriptome levels. The second dimension can be obtained by targeting the Cas9 protein to multiple unique genomic sites by applying multiple different single guiding (sg) RNAs, each defining a different DNA-binding site. Finally, the simultaneous use of phylogenetically different Cas9 proteins or sgRNAs that harbour different types of protein binding motives, allows for a third dimension of control. Thus, different types of enzyme activities - fused either to one type of Cas9 orthologue or to one type of RNA-binding domain specific to one type of sgRNA - can be targeted to multiple different genomic sites simultaneously. Thus, it should be possible to induce quantitatively different levels of expression of certain sets of genes and at the same time to repress other genes, redefining the nuclear transcriptome. Likewise, by the use of different types of histone-modifying and/or DNA (de)methylating activities, the epigenome of plants should be reprogrammable. On our way to synthetic plant genomes, the next steps will be to use complex genome engineering approaches within or between species borders to restructure and recombine natural or artificial chromosomes.

26673779	CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-CRISPR associated nuclease 9) systems have emerged as versatile and convenient (epi)genome editing tools and have become an important player in medical genetic research. CRISPR-Cas9 and its variants such as catalytically inactivated Cas9 (dead Cas9, dCas9) and scaffold-incorporating single guide sgRNA (scRNA) have been applied in various genomic screen studies. CRISPR screens enable high-throughput interrogation of gene functions in health and diseases. Compared with conventional RNAi screens, CRISPR screens incur less off-target effects and are more versatile in that they can be used in multiple formats such as knockout, knockdown and activation screens, and can target coding and non-coding regions throughout the genome. This powerful screen platform holds the potential of revolutionising functional genomic studies in the near future. Herein, we introduce the mechanisms of (epi)genome editing mediated by CRISPR-Cas9 and its variants, introduce the procedures and applications of CRISPR screen in functional genomics, compare it with conventional screen tools and at last discuss current challenges and opportunities and propose future directions.

26657769	To facilitate understanding the mechanisms of somatic reprogramming to human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), we have established intermediately reprogrammed stem cells (iRSCs), human mesenchymal cells that express exogenous Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc (OSKM) and endogenous SOX2 and NANOG. iRSCs can be stably maintained at low density. At high density, however, they are induced to enter mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET), resulting in reprogramming to an iPSC state. Morphological changes through MET correlate with silencing of exogenous OSKM, and upregulation of endogenous OCT4. A CRISPR/Cas9-mediated GFP knock-in visualized the temporal regulation of endogenous OCT4 in cells converting from iRSC to iPSC state. OCT4 activation coincident with silencing of OSKM occurred prior to entering MET. Notably, OCT4 instability was frequently observed in cells of developing post-MET colonies until a late stage (>200 cells), demonstrating that OCT4-activated post-MET cells switched from asymmetric to symmetric cell division in late stage reprogramming.

26656253	Genome-editing tools, and in particular those based on CRISPR-Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated protein) systems, are accelerating the pace of biological research and enabling targeted genetic interrogation in almost any organism and cell type. These tools have opened the door to the development of new model systems for studying the complexity of the nervous system, including animal models and stem cell-derived in vitro models.

26649574	CP190 is a large, multi-domain protein, first identified as a centrosome protein with oscillatory localization over the course of the cell cycle. During interphase it has a well-established role within the nucleus as a chromatin insulator. Upon nuclear envelope breakdown, there is a striking redistribution of CP190 to centrosomes and the mitotic spindle, in addition to the population at chromosomes. Here, we investigate CP190 in detail by performing domain analysis in cultured Drosophila S2 cells combined with protein structure determination by X-ray crystallography, in vitro biochemical characterization, and in vivo fixed and live imaging of cp190 mutant flies. Our analysis of CP190 identifies a novel N-terminal centrosome and microtubule (MT) targeting region, sufficient for spindle localization. This region consists of a highly conserved BTB domain and a linker region that serves as the MT binding domain. We present the 2.5 Å resolution structure of the CP190 N-terminal 126 amino acids, which adopts a canonical BTB domain fold and exists as a stable dimer in solution. The ability of the linker region to robustly localize to MTs requires BTB domain-mediated dimerization. Deletion of the linker region using CRISPR significantly alters spindle morphology and leads to DNA segregation errors in the developing Drosophila brain neuroblasts. Collectively, we highlight a multivalent MT-binding architecture in CP190, which confers distinct subcellular cytoskeletal localization and function during mitosis.

26641531	Gene drive systems that enable super-Mendelian inheritance of a transgene have the potential to modify insect populations over a timeframe of a few years. We describe CRISPR-Cas9 endonuclease constructs that function as gene drive systems in Anopheles gambiae, the main vector for malaria. We identified three genes (AGAP005958, AGAP011377 and AGAP007280) that confer a recessive female-sterility phenotype upon disruption, and inserted into each locus CRISPR-Cas9 gene drive constructs designed to target and edit each gene. For each targeted locus we observed a strong gene drive at the molecular level, with transmission rates to progeny of 91.4 to 99.6%. Population modeling and cage experiments indicate that a CRISPR-Cas9 construct targeting one of these loci, AGAP007280, meets the minimum requirement for a gene drive targeting female reproduction in an insect population. These findings could expedite the development of gene drives to suppress mosquito populations to levels that do not support malaria transmission.

26638527	Prokaryotic organisms possess numerous strategies that enable survival in hostile conditions. Among others, these conditions include the invasion of foreign nucleic acids such as bacteriophages and plasmids. The clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats-CRISPR-associated proteins (CRISPR-Cas) system provides the majority of bacteria and archaea with adaptive and hereditary immunity against this threat. This mechanism of immunity is based on short fragments of foreign DNA incorporated within the hosts genome. After transcription, these fragments guide protein complexes that target foreign nucleic acids and promote their degradation. The aim of this review is to summarize the current status of CRISPR-Cas research, including the mechanisms of action, the classification of different types and subtypes of these systems, and the development of new CRISPR-Cas-based molecular biology tools.

26634302	Human platelet alloantigens (HPAs) reside on functionally important platelet membrane glycoproteins and are caused by single nucleotide polymorphisms in the genes that encode them. Antibodies that form against HPAs are responsible for several clinically important alloimmune bleeding disorders, including fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia and posttransfusion purpura. The HPA-1a/HPA-1b alloantigen system, also known as the Pl(A1)/Pl(A2) polymorphism, is the most frequently implicated HPA among whites, and a single Leu33Pro amino acid polymorphism within the integrin β3 subunit is responsible for generating the HPA-1a/HPA-1b alloantigenic epitopes. HPA-1b/b platelets, like those bearing other low-frequency platelet-specific alloantigens, are relatively rare in the population and difficult to obtain for purposes of transfusion therapy and diagnostic testing. We used CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR associated protein 9) gene-editing technology to transform Leu33 (+) megakaryocytelike DAMI cells and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to the Pro33 allotype. CD41(+) megakaryocyte progenitors derived from these cells expressed the HPA-1b (Pl(A2)) alloantigenic epitope, as reported by diagnostic NciI restriction enzyme digestion, DNA sequencing, and western blot analysis using HPA-1b-specific human maternal alloantisera. Application of CRISPR/Cas9 technology to genetically edit this and other clinically-important HPAs holds great potential for production of designer platelets for diagnostic, investigative, and, ultimately, therapeutic use.

26632358	Two genetic technologies capable of making heritable changes to the human genome have revived interest in, and in some quarters a very familiar panic concerning, so-called germline interventions. These technologies are: most recently the use of CRISPR/Cas9 to edit genes in non-viable IVF zygotes and Mitochondrial Replacement Therapy (MRT) the use of which was approved in principle in a landmark vote earlier this year by the United Kingdom Parliament. The possibility of using either of these techniques in humans has encountered the most violent hostility and suspicion. However it is important to be aware that much of this hostility dates back to the fears associated with In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) and other reproductive technologies and by cloning; fears which were baseless at the time concerning both IVF and cloning the use of both of which have proved to be highly beneficial to humanity and which have been effectively regulated and controlled. This paper argues that CRISPR should by pursued through researh until it is safe enough for use in humans but there is no reason to suppose at this stage that such use will be unsafe or unethical (Collins 2015).

26632357	CRISPR germline editing therapies (CGETs) hold unprecedented potential to eradicate hereditary disorders. However, the prospect of altering the human germline has sparked a debate over the safety, efficacy, and morality of CGETs, triggering a funding moratorium by the NIH. There is an urgent need for practical paths for the evaluation of these capabilities. We propose a model regulatory framework for CGET research, clinical development, and distribution. Our model takes advantage of existing legal and regulatory institutions but adds elevated scrutiny at each stage of CGET development to accommodate the unique technical and ethical challenges posed by germline editing.

26632356	Recent experiments have been used to "edit" genomes of various plant, animal and other species, including humans, with unprecedented precision. Furthermore, editing the Cas9 endonuclease gene with a gene encoding the desired guide RNA into an organism, adjacent to an altered gene, could create a "gene drive" that could spread a trait through an entire population of organisms. These experiments represent advances along a spectrum of technological abilities that genetic engineers have been working on since the advent of recombinant DNA techniques. The scientific and bioethics communities have built substantial literatures about the ethical and policy implications of genetic engineering, especially in the age of bioterrorism. However, recent CRISPr/Cas experiments have triggered a rehashing of previous policy discussions, suggesting that the scientific community requires guidance on how to think about social responsibility. We propose a framework to enable analysis of social responsibility, using two examples of genetic engineering experiments.	PL Sankar|MK Cho
26632355	This essay focuses on possible nonhuman applications of CRISPR/Cas9 that are likely to be widely overlooked because they are unexpected and, in some cases, perhaps even "frivolous." We look at five uses for "CRISPR Critters": wild de-extinction, domestic de-extinction, personal whim, art, and novel forms of disease prevention. We then discuss the current regulatory framework and its possible limitations in those contexts. We end with questions about some deeper issues raised by the increased human control over life on earth offered by genome editing.	RA Charo|HT Greely

26628271	Live microbes have been isolated from rock salt up to Permian age. Only obligatory cellular functions can be performed in halite-buried cells. Consequently, their genomic sequences are likely to remain virtually unchanged. However, the available sequence information from these organisms is scarce and consists of mainly ribosomal 16S sequences. Here, live archaea were isolated from early Cretaceous (∼ 123 million years old) halite from the depth of 2000 m in Qianjiang Depression, Hubei Province, China. The sample was radiologically dated and subjected to rigorous surface sterilization before microbe isolation. The isolates represented a single novel species of Halobacterium, for which we suggest the name Halobacterium hubeiense, type strain Hbt. hubeiense JI20-1. The species was closely related to a Permian (225-280 million years old) isolate, Halobacterium noricense, originating from Alpine rock salt. This study is the first one to publish the complete genome of an organism originating from surface-sterilized ancient halite. In the future, genomic data from halite-buried microbes can become a key factor in understanding the mechanisms by which these organisms are able to survive in harsh conditions deep underground or possibly on other celestial bodies.

26626625	The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) consists of a tripartite synapse with a presynaptic nerve terminal, Schwann cells that ensheathe the terminal bouton, and a highly specialized postsynaptic membrane. Synaptic structural integrity is crucial for efficient signal transmission. Congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMSs) are a heterogeneous group of inherited disorders that result from impaired neuromuscular transmission, caused by mutations in genes encoding proteins that are involved in synaptic transmission and in forming and maintaining the structural integrity of NMJs. To identify further causes of CMSs, we performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) in families without an identified mutation in known CMS-associated genes. In two families affected by a previously undefined CMS, we identified homozygous loss-of-function mutations in COL13A1, which encodes the alpha chain of an atypical non-fibrillar collagen with a single transmembrane domain. COL13A1 localized to the human muscle motor endplate. Using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, modeling of the COL13A1 c.1171delG (p.Leu392Sfs(∗)71) frameshift mutation in the C2C12 cell line reduced acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clustering during myotube differentiation. This highlights the crucial role of collagen XIII in the formation and maintenance of the NMJ. Our results therefore delineate a myasthenic disorder that is caused by loss-of-function mutations in COL13A1, encoding a protein involved in organization of the NMJ, and emphasize the importance of appropriate symptomatic treatment for these individuals.

26623729	Recurrent somatic mutations of the epigenetic modifier and tumor suppressor ASXL1 are common in myeloid malignancies, including chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and are associated with poor clinical outcome. CRISPR/Cas9 has recently emerged as a powerful and versatile genome editing tool for genome engineering in various species. We have used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to correct the ASXL1 homozygous nonsense mutation present in the CML cell line KBM5, which lacks ASXL1 protein expression. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated ASXL1 homozygous correction resulted in protein re-expression with restored normal function, including down-regulation of Polycomb repressive complex 2 target genes. Significantly reduced cell growth and increased myeloid differentiation were observed in ASXL1 mutation-corrected cells, providing new insights into the role of ASXL1 in human myeloid cell differentiation. Mice xenografted with mutation-corrected KBM5 cells showed significantly longer survival than uncorrected xenografts. These results show that the sole correction of a driver mutation in leukemia cells increases survival in vivo in mice. This study provides proof-of-concept for driver gene mutation correction via CRISPR/Cas9 technology in human leukemia cells and presents a strategy to illuminate the impact of oncogenic mutations on cellular function and survival.

26620907	The interaction between centrosomes and mitotic spindle poles is important for efficient spindle formation, orientation, and cell polarity. However, our understanding of the dynamics of this relationship and implications for tissue homeostasis remains poorly understood. Here we report that Drosophila melanogaster calmodulin (CaM) regulates the ability of the microcephaly-associated protein, abnormal spindle (Asp), to cross-link spindle microtubules. Both proteins colocalize on spindles and move toward spindle poles, suggesting that they form a complex. Our binding and structure-function analysis support this hypothesis. Disruption of the Asp-CaM interaction alone leads to unfocused spindle poles and centrosome detachment. This behavior leads to randomly inherited centrosomes after neuroblast division. We further show that spindle polarity is maintained in neuroblasts despite centrosome detachment, with the poles remaining stably associated with the cell cortex. Finally, we provide evidence that CaM is required for Asp's spindle function; however, it is completely dispensable for Asp's role in microcephaly suppression.

26607397	Complete eradication of HIV-1 infection is impeded by the existence of cells that harbor chromosomally integrated but transcriptionally inactive provirus. These cells can persist for years without producing viral progeny, rendering them refractory to immune surveillance and antiretroviral therapy and providing a permanent reservoir for the stochastic reactivation and reseeding of HIV-1. Strategies for purging this latent reservoir are thus needed to eradicate infection. Here, we show that engineered transcriptional activation systems based on CRISPR/Cas9 can be harnessed to activate viral gene expression in cell line models of HIV-1 latency. We further demonstrate that complementing Cas9 activators with latency-reversing compounds can enhance latent HIV-1 transcription and that epigenome modulation using CRISPR-based acetyltransferases can also promote viral gene activation. Collectively, these results demonstrate that CRISPR systems are potentially effective tools for inducing latent HIV-1 expression and that their use, in combination with antiretroviral therapy, could lead to improved therapies for HIV-1 infection.

26603121	Gene targeting (GT) is of great significance for advancing basic plant research and crop improvement. Both TALENs (transcription activator-like effectors nucleases) and CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated 9) systems have been developed for genome editing in eukaryotes, including crop plants. In this work, we present the comparative analysis of these two technologies for two soybean genome editing targets, GmPDS11 and GmPDS18. We found GT in soybean hairy roots with a single targeting efficiency range of 17.5-21.1% by TALENs, 11.7-18.1% by CRISPR/Cas9 using the AtU6-26 promoter, and 43.4-48.1% by CRISPR/Cas9 using the GmU6-16g-1 promoter, suggesting that the CRISPR/Cas9 using the GmU6-16g-1 promoter is probably a much more efficient tool compared to the other technologies. Similarly, our double mutation GT efficiency experiment with these three technologies displayed a targeting efficiency of 6.25% by TALENs, 12.5% by CRISPR/Cas9 using the AtU6-26 promoter, and 43.4-48.1% by CRISPR/Cas9 using the GmU6-16g-1 promoter, suggesting that CRISPR/Cas9 is still a better choice for simultaneous editing of multiple homoeoalleles. Furthermore, we observed albino and dwarf buds (PDS knock-out) by soybean transformation in cotyledon nodes. Our results demonstrated that both TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 systems are powerful tools for soybean genome editing.	H Du|X Zeng|M Zhao|X Cui|Q Wang|H Yang|H Cheng|D Yu
26602035	Mammalian expression systems, due to their capacity in post-translational modification, are preferred systems for biopharmaceutical protein production. Several recombinant protein systems have been introduced to the market, most of which are under clinical development. In spite of significant improvements such as cell line engineering, introducing novel expression methods, gene silencing and process development, expression level is unpredictable and unstable because of the random location of integration in the genome. Site-specific recombination techniques are capable of producing stable and high producer clonal cells; therefore, they are gaining more importance in the biopharmaceutical production. Site-specific recombination methods increase the recombinant protein production by specifically inserting a vector at a locus with specific expression trait. The present review focused on the latest developments in site-specific recombination techniques, their specific features and comparisons.	M Ahmadi|N Damavandi|MR Akbari Eidgahi|F Davami
26598698	Genetic engineering technologies can be used both to create transgenic mosquitoes carrying antipathogen effector genes targeting human malaria parasites and to generate gene-drive systems capable of introgressing the genes throughout wild vector populations. We developed a highly effective autonomous Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-associated protein 9 (Cas9)-mediated gene-drive system in the Asian malaria vector Anopheles stephensi, adapted from the mutagenic chain reaction (MCR). This specific system results in progeny of males and females derived from transgenic males exhibiting a high frequency of germ-line gene conversion consistent with homology-directed repair (HDR). This system copies an ∼ 17-kb construct from its site of insertion to its homologous chromosome in a faithful, site-specific manner. Dual anti-Plasmodium falciparum effector genes, a marker gene, and the autonomous gene-drive components are introgressed into ∼ 99.5% of the progeny following outcrosses of transgenic lines to wild-type mosquitoes. The effector genes remain transcriptionally inducible upon blood feeding. In contrast to the efficient conversion in individuals expressing Cas9 only in the germ line, males and females derived from transgenic females, which are expected to have drive component molecules in the egg, produce progeny with a high frequency of mutations in the targeted genome sequence, resulting in near-Mendelian inheritance ratios of the transgene. Such mutant alleles result presumably from nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) events before the segregation of somatic and germ-line lineages early in development. These data support the design of this system to be active strictly within the germ line. Strains based on this technology could sustain control and elimination as part of the malaria eradication agenda.	VM Gantz|N Jasinskiene|O Tatarenkova|A Fazekas|VM Macias|E Bier|AA James
26595770	Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are conserved noncoding RNAs best studied as ribonucleoprotein (RNP) guides in RNA modification. To explore their role in cancer, we compared 5,473 tumor-normal genome pairs to identify snoRNAs with frequent copy number loss. The SNORD50A-SNORD50B snoRNA locus was deleted in 10-40% of 12 common cancers, where its loss was associated with reduced survival. A human protein microarray screen identified direct SNORD50A and SNORD50B RNA binding to K-Ras. Loss of SNORD50A and SNORD50B increased the amount of GTP-bound, active K-Ras and hyperactivated Ras-ERK1/ERK2 signaling. Loss of these snoRNAs also increased binding by farnesyltransferase to K-Ras and increased K-Ras prenylation, suggesting that KRAS mutation might synergize with SNORD50A and SNORD50B loss in cancer. In agreement with this hypothesis, CRISPR-mediated deletion of SNORD50A and SNORD50B in KRAS-mutant tumor cells enhanced tumorigenesis, and SNORD50A and SNORD50B deletion and oncogenic KRAS mutation co-occurred significantly in multiple human tumor types. SNORD50A and SNORD50B snoRNAs thus directly bind and inhibit K-Ras and are recurrently deleted in human cancer.

26592975	Type I interferons (IFNs) are key mediators of the innate antiviral response in mammalian cells. Elongation initiation factor 4E binding proteins (4E-BPs) are translational controllers of interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF-7), the "master regulator" of IFN transcription. Previous studies have suggested that mouse cells depleted of 4E-BPs are more sensitive to IFNβ treatment and had lower viral loads as compared to wild type (WT) cells. However, such approach has not been tested as an antiviral strategy in livestock species. In this study, we tested the antiviral activity of porcine cells depleted of 4E-BP1 by a Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein-9 nuclease (Cas9) genome engineering system. We found that 4E-BP1 knockout (KO) porcine cells had increased expression of IFNα and β, IFN stimulated genes, and significant reduction in vesicular stomatitis virus titer as compare to WT cells. No phenotypical changes associated with CRISPR/Cas9 manipulation were observed in 4E-BP1 KO cells.

Here we develop a chemically modified, 29-nucleotide synthetic CRISPR RNA (scrRNA), which in combination with unmodified transactivating crRNA (tracrRNA) is shown to functionally replace the natural guide RNA in the CRISPR-Cas9 nuclease system and to mediate efficient genome editing in human cells. Incorporation of rational chemical modifications known to protect against nuclease digestion and stabilize RNA-RNA interactions in the tracrRNA hybridization region of CRISPR RNA (crRNA) yields a scrRNA with enhanced activity compared with the unmodified crRNA and comparable gene disruption activity to the previously published single guide RNA. Taken together, these findings provide a platform for therapeutic applications, especially for nervous system disease, using successive application of cell-permeable, synthetic CRISPR RNAs to activate and then silence Cas9 nuclease activity.

26588350	In the recent decades, human genome engineering has been one of the major interesting research subjects, essentially because it raises new possibilities for personalized medicine and biotechnologies. With the development of engineered nucleases such as the Zinc Finger Nucleases (ZFNs), the Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and more recently the Clustered Regularly Interspaced short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR), the field of human genome edition has evolved very rapidly. Every new genetic tool is broadening the scope of applications on human tissues, even before we can completely master each of these tools. In this review, we will present the recent advances regarding human genome edition tools, we will discuss the numerous implications they have in research and medicine, and we will mention the limits and concerns about such technologies.

26586803	CRISPR immunity depends on acquisition of fragments of foreign DNA into CRISPR arrays. For type I-E CRISPR-Cas systems two modes of spacer acquisition, naïve and primed adaptation, were described. Naïve adaptation requires just two most conserved Cas1 and Cas2 proteins; it leads to spacer acquisition from both foreign and bacterial DNA and results in multiple spacers incapable of immune response. Primed adaptation requires all Cas proteins and a CRISPR RNA recognizing a partially matching target. It leads to selective acquisition of spacers from DNA molecules recognized by priming CRISPR RNA, with most spacers capable of protecting the host. Here, we studied spacer acquisition by a type I-F CRISPR-Cas system. We observe both naïve and primed adaptation. Both processes require not just Cas1 and Cas2, but also intact Csy complex and CRISPR RNA. Primed adaptation shows a gradient of acquisition efficiency as a function of distance from the priming site and a strand bias that is consistent with existence of single-stranded adaption intermediates. The results provide new insights into the mechanism of spacer acquisition and illustrate surprising mechanistic diversity of related CRISPR-Cas systems.

26586800	CRISPR-Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-CRISPR associated) systems allow bacteria to adapt to infection by acquiring 'spacer' sequences from invader DNA into genomic CRISPR loci. Cas proteins use RNAs derived from these loci to target cognate sequences for destruction through CRISPR interference. Mutations in the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) and seed regions block interference but promote rapid 'primed' adaptation. Here, we use multiple spacer sequences to reexamine the PAM and seed sequence requirements for interference and priming in the Escherichia coli Type I-E CRISPR-Cas system. Surprisingly, CRISPR interference is far more tolerant of mutations in the seed and the PAM than previously reported, and this mutational tolerance, as well as priming activity, is highly dependent on spacer sequence. We identify a large number of functional PAMs that can promote interference, priming or both activities, depending on the associated spacer sequence. Functional PAMs are preferentially acquired during unprimed 'naïve' adaptation, leading to a rapid priming response following infection. Our results provide numerous insights into the importance of both spacer and target sequences for interference and priming, and reveal that priming is a major pathway for adaptation during initial infection.

26585795	To expand the repertoire of Cas9s available for genome targeting, we present a new in vitro method for the simultaneous examination of guide RNA and protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) requirements. The method relies on the in vitro cleavage of plasmid libraries containing a randomized PAM as a function of Cas9-guide RNA complex concentration. Using this method, we accurately reproduce the canonical PAM preferences for Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus thermophilus CRISPR3 (Sth3), and CRISPR1 (Sth1). Additionally, PAM and sgRNA solutions for a novel Cas9 protein from Brevibacillus laterosporus are provided by the assay and are demonstrated to support functional activity in vitro and in plants.

26581162	HIV-1 provirus integration results in a persistent latently infected reservoir that is recalcitrant to combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) with lifelong treatment being the only option. The "shock and kill" strategy aims to eradicate latent HIV by reactivating proviral gene expression in the context of cART treatment. Gene-specific transcriptional activation can be achieved using the RNA-guided CRISPR-Cas9 system comprising single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) with a nuclease-deficient Cas9 mutant (dCas9) fused to the VP64 transactivation domain (dCas9-VP64). We engineered this system to target 23 sites within the long terminal repeat promoter of HIV-1 and identified a "hotspot" for activation within the viral enhancer sequence. Activating sgRNAs transcriptionally modulated the latent proviral genome across multiple different in vitro latency cell models including T cells comprising a clonally integrated mCherry-IRES-Tat (LChIT) latency system. We detected consistent and effective activation of latent virus mediated by activator sgRNAs, whereas latency reversal agents produced variable activation responses. Transcriptomic analysis revealed dCas9-VP64/sgRNAs to be highly specific, while the well-characterized chemical activator TNFα induced widespread gene dysregulation. CRISPR-mediated gene activation represents a novel system which provides enhanced efficiency and specificity in a targeted latency reactivation strategy and represents a promising approach to a "functional cure" of HIV/AIDS.

26576611	Targeted modification of genes ("gene editing") is made much easier by the recently developed CRISPR-Cas9 system. This has raised alarm about possible uses of this technology for germline modification of the human genome; however this technology has less controversial applications, notably for somatic gene therapy with already some striking demonstrations in animal systems. Because of its precision and relative ease of use, CRISPR can be expected to drive a revolution in gene therapy and to turn it into a more mainstream approach.	B Jordan
26576609	A new technology, called CRISPR, derived from the immune system of bacteria, uses a Cas9 nuclease and a guided RNA complementary to a 20 nucleotides sequence of a gene to induce double strand DNA breaks. This permits to modify specifically the targeted gene in plant, animal and human cells. Variants of the technique also permit to reduce or increase the expression of a selected gene. This technology may thus be used not only to understand the role of a gene but also to develop therapies for hereditary and acquired diseases.	JP Tremblay

26564855	The RNA-guided CRISPR-associated protein Cas9 is used for genome editing, transcriptional modulation, and live-cell imaging. Cas9-guide RNA complexes recognize and cleave double-stranded DNA sequences on the basis of 20-nucleotide RNA-DNA complementarity, but the mechanism of target searching in mammalian cells is unknown. Here, we use single-particle tracking to visualize diffusion and chromatin binding of Cas9 in living cells. We show that three-dimensional diffusion dominates Cas9 searching in vivo, and off-target binding events are, on average, short-lived (<1 second). Searching is dependent on the local chromatin environment, with less sampling and slower movement within heterochromatin. These results reveal how the bacterial Cas9 protein interrogates mammalian genomes and navigates eukaryotic chromatin structure.

26553871	Inflammasomes are high molecular weight protein complexes that assemble in the cytosol upon pathogen encounter. This results in caspase-1-dependent pro-inflammatory cytokine maturation, as well as a special type of cell death, known as pyroptosis. The Nlrp3 inflammasome plays a pivotal role in pathogen defense, but at the same time, its activity has also been implicated in many common sterile inflammatory conditions. To this effect, several studies have identified Nlrp3 inflammasome engagement in a number of common human diseases such as atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer disease, or gout. Although it has been shown that known Nlrp3 stimuli converge on potassium ion efflux upstream of Nlrp3 activation, the exact molecular mechanism of Nlrp3 activation remains elusive. Here, we describe a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen in immortalized mouse macrophages aiming at the unbiased identification of gene products involved in Nlrp3 inflammasome activation. We employed a FACS-based screen for Nlrp3-dependent cell death, using the ionophoric compound nigericin as a potassium efflux-inducing stimulus. Using a genome-wide guide RNA (gRNA) library, we found that targeting Nek7 rescued macrophages from nigericin-induced lethality. Subsequent studies revealed that murine macrophages deficient in Nek7 displayed a largely blunted Nlrp3 inflammasome response, whereas Aim2-mediated inflammasome activation proved to be fully intact. Although the mechanism of Nek7 functioning upstream of Nlrp3 yet remains elusive, these studies provide a first genetic handle of a component that specifically functions upstream of Nlrp3.

26549684	Eukaryotic transcription is pervasive, and many of the resulting RNAs are non-coding. It is unknown whether ubiquitous transcription is functional or simply reflects stochastic transcriptional noise. By single-molecule visualization of the dynamic interplay between coding and non-coding transcription at the GAL locus in living yeast cells, we show that antisense GAL10 ncRNA transcription can switch between functional and spurious under different conditions. During galactose induction, GAL10 sense transcription occurs in short stochastic bursts, which are unaffected by transcription of antisense GAL10 ncRNA, even when both are present simultaneously at the same locus. In contrast, when GAL10 is not induced, ncRNA transcription is critical to prevent transcriptional leakage of GAL1 and GAL10. Suppression of ncRNA transcription by strand-specific CRISPR/dCas9 results in transcriptional leakage of the inducer GAL1, leading to a more sensitive transcription activation threshold, an alteration of metabolic switching, and a fitness defect in competition experiments.

26540648	Altering endogenous genes in cells is an integral tool of modern cell biology. The ease-of-use of the CRISPR/Cas9 system to introduce genomic DNA breaks at specific sites in vivo has led to its rapid and wide adoption. In the absence of a DNA template, the lesion is repaired by nonhomologous end joining resolving as internal deletions. However, in the presence of a homologous DNA template, homology-directed repair occurs with variable efficiencies. Recent work has demonstrated that highly efficient gene targeting can be induced by combining CRISPR/Cas9 targeting of genomic loci with recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) to provide a single-stranded homologous DNA template. Here we review the current state of CRISPR/Cas-based gene editing and provide a practical guide to applying the CRISPR/Cas and rAAV system for highly efficient, time- and cost-effective gene targeting.

26538064	Current antiretroviral therapy does not eliminate the integrated and transcriptionally silent HIV-1 provirus in latently infected cells. Recently, a "shock and kill" strategy has been extensively explored to eradicate the HIV-1 latent reservoirs for a permanent cure of AIDS. The therapeutic efficacy of currently used agents remains disappointing because of low efficiency, non-specificity and cellular toxicity. Here we present a novel catalytically-deficient Cas9-synergistic activation mediator (dCas9-SAM) technology to selectively, potently and persistently reactivate the HIV-1 latent reservoirs. By screening 16 MS2-mediated single guide RNAs, we identified long terminal repeat (LTR)-L and O that surround the enhancer region (-165/-145 for L and -92/-112 for O) and induce robust reactivation of HIV-1 provirus in HIV-1 latent TZM-bI epithelial, Jurkat T lymphocytic and CHME5 microglial cells. This compulsory reactivation induced cellular suicide via toxic buildup of viral proteins within HIV-1 latent Jurkat T and CHME5 microglial cells. These results suggest that this highly effective and target-specific dCas9-SAM system can serve as a novel HIV-latency-reversing therapeutic tool for the permanent elimination of HIV-1 latent reservoirs.

26537785	Leptin receptor, which is encoded by the diabetes (db) gene and is highly expressed in the choroid plexus, regulatesenergy homeostasis, the balance between food intake and energy expenditure, fertility and bone mass. Here, using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we created the leptin receptor knockout rat. Homozygous leptin receptor null rats are characterized by obesity, hyperphagia, hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance, hyperinsulinemia and dyslipidemia. Due to long-term poor glycemic control, the leptin receptor knockout rats also develop some diabetic complications such as pancreatic, hepatic and renal lesions. In addition, the leptin receptor knockout rats show a significant decrease in bone volume and bone mineral density of the femur compared with their wild-type littermates. Our model has rescued some deficiency of the existing rodent models, such as the transient hyperglycemia of db/db mice in the C57BL/6J genetic background and the delayed onset of glucose intolerance in the Zucker rats, and it is proven to be a useful animal model for biomedical and pharmacological research on obesity and diabetes.

26527742	Pseudostratified airway epithelium of the lung is composed of polarized ciliated and secretory cells maintained by basal stem/progenitor cells. An important question is how lineage choice and differentiation are coordinated with apical-basal polarity and epithelial morphogenesis. Our previous studies indicated a key integrative role for the transcription factor Grainyhead-like 2 (Grhl2). In this study, we present further evidence for this model using conditional gene deletion during the regeneration of airway epithelium and clonal organoid culture. We also use CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in primary human basal cells differentiating into organoids and mucociliary epithelium in vitro. Loss of Grhl2 inhibits organoid morphogenesis and the differentiation of ciliated cells and reduces the expression of both notch and ciliogenesis genes (Mcidas, Rfx2, and Myb) with distinct Grhl2 regulatory sites. The genome editing of other putative target genes reveals roles for zinc finger transcription factor Znf750 and small membrane adhesion glycoprotein in promoting ciliogenesis and barrier function as part of a network of genes coordinately regulated by Grhl2.

26527377	Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is one of the most prevalent myopathies, affecting males and females of all ages. Both forms of the disease are linked by epigenetic derepression of the D4Z4 macrosatellite repeat array at chromosome 4q35, leading to aberrant expression of D4Z4-encoded RNAs in skeletal muscle. Production of full-length DUX4 (DUX4-fl) mRNA from the derepressed D4Z4 array results in misexpression of DUX4-FL protein and its transcriptional targets, and apoptosis, ultimately leading to accumulated muscle pathology. Returning the chromatin at the FSHD locus to its nonpathogenic, epigenetically repressed state would simultaneously affect all D4Z4 RNAs, inhibiting downstream pathogenic pathways, and is thus an attractive therapeutic strategy. Advances in CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing make it possible to target epigenetic modifiers to an endogenous disease locus, although reports to date have focused on more typical genomic regions. Here, we demonstrate that a CRISPR/dCas9 transcriptional inhibitor can be specifically targeted to the highly repetitive FSHD macrosatellite array and alter the chromatin to repress expression of DUX4-fl in primary FSHD myocytes. These results implicate the promoter and exon 1 of DUX4 as potential therapeutic targets and demonstrate the utility of CRISPR technology for correction of the epigenetic dysregulation in FSHD.

26518609	This study evaluates an improved scheme for Campylobacter genotyping based on the combination of true and questionable CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) elements. A total of 180 Campylobacter strains (Campylobacter jejuni n=93 and Campylobacter coli n=87), isolated from neck skin and caecal content of broilers, poultry meat and sewage water were analysed. Another 97 C. jejuni DNA samples from cases of human campylobacteriosis were assessed. Sixty-three genotypes were found in C. jejuni considering only true CRISPR, and 16 additional genotypes were identified when questionable CRISPR were also taken into account. Likewise in C. coli the number of genotypes increased from eight for only true CRISPR to 14 after including questionable CRISPR elements. The number of typeable C. jejuni and C. coli isolates was 115 (60.5%) and 17 (19.5%) respectively considering only true CRISPR. These percentages increased to 92.7% (n=176) and 39.1% (n=34) respectively when both true and questionable CRISPR were considered. 60.9% of the C. coli isolates were non-typeable by CRISPR due to the lack of any PCR amplifiable CRISPR loci, which raises questions about CRISPR analysis as an appropriate method for C. coli typing. However the assessment of true and questionable CRISPR has proved to be fairly useful for typing C. jejuni due to its high discriminatory power (Simpson's index=0.960) and typeability (92.7%) values. The results of the present work show that our genotyping method based on the combination of true and questionable CRISPR elements may be used as a suitable complementary tool to existing C. jejuni genotyping methods.

26517564	The specificity of RNA-guided nucleases has gathered considerable interest as they become broadly applied to basic research and therapeutic development. Reports of the simple generation of animal models and genome engineering of cells raised questions about targeting precision. Conflicting early reports led the field to believe that CRISPR/Cas9 system was promiscuous, leading to a variety of strategies for improving specificity and increasingly sensitive methods to detect off-target events. However, other studies have suggested that CRISPR/Cas9 is a highly specific genome-editing tool. This review will focus on deciphering and interpreting these seemingly opposing claims.

26517238	RNase L is a regulated endoribonuclease that functions in the interferon antiviral response. Activation of RNase L by 2', 5'-oligoadenylates has been linked to apoptosis, autophagy and inflammation. Genetic studies have also suggested the possible involvement of the RNase L gene (RNASEL) on chromosome 1q25.3 in several types of cancer. Here we report that ablation of RNase L in human prostate cancer PC3 cells by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology enhanced cell migration as determined both by transwell assays and scratch wound healing assays. In addition, RNase L knockdown by means of RNAi increased migration of PC3 and DU145 cells in response to either fibronectin or serum stimulation, as did homozygous disruption of the RNase L gene in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Serum or fibronectin stimulation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) autophosphorylation on tyrosine-397 was increased by either knockdown or ablation of RNase L. In contrast, a missense mutant RNase L (R667A) lacking catalytic activity failed to suppress cell migration in PC3 cells. However, a nuclease-inactive mutant mouse RNase L (W630A) was able to partially inhibit migration of mouse fibroblasts. Consistent with a role for the catalytic activity of RNase L, transfection of PC3 cells with the RNase L activator, 2', 5'-oligoadenylate, suppressed cell migration. RNase L knockdown in PC3 cells enhanced tumor growth and metastasis following implantation in the mouse prostate. Our results suggest that naturally occurring mutations in the RNase L gene might promote enhanced cell migration and metastasis.

26514343	A transcriptome study was performed on Sulfolobus islandicus REY15A actively undergoing CRISPR spacer acquisition from the crenarchaeal monocaudavirus STSV2 in rich and basal media over a 6 day period. Spacer acquisition preceded strong host growth retardation, altered transcriptional activity of four different CRISPR-Cas modules and changes in viral copy numbers, and with significant differences in the two media. Transcript levels of proteins involved in the cell cycle were reduced, whereas those of DNA replication, DNA repair, transcriptional regulation and some antitoxin-toxin pairs and transposases were unchanged or enhanced. Antisense RNAs were implicated in the transcriptional regulation of adaptation and interference modules of the type I-A CRISPR-Cas system, and evidence was found for the occurrence of functional co-ordination between the single CRISPR-Cas adaptation module and the functionally diverse interference modules.

26513700	The humble house mouse has long been a workhorse model system in biomedical research. The technology for introducing site-specific genome modifications led to Nobel Prizes for its pioneers and opened a new era of mouse genetics. However, this technology was very time-consuming and technically demanding. As a result, many investigators continued to employ easier genome manipulation methods, though resulting models can suffer from overlooked or underestimated consequences. Another breakthrough, invaluable for the molecular dissection of disease mechanisms, was the invention of high-throughput methods to measure the expression of a plethora of genes in parallel. However, the use of samples containing material from multiple cell types could obfuscate data, and thus interpretations. In this review we highlight some important issues in experimental approaches using mouse models for biomedical research. We then discuss recent technological advances in mouse genetics that are revolutionising human disease research. Mouse genomes are now easily manipulated at precise locations thanks to guided endonucleases, such as transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) or the CRISPR/Cas9 system, both also having the potential to turn the dream of human gene therapy into reality. Newly developed methods of cell type-specific isolation of transcriptomes from crude tissue homogenates, followed by detection with next generation sequencing (NGS), are vastly improving gene regulation studies. Taken together, these amazing tools simplify the creation of much more accurate mouse models of human disease, and enable the extraction of hitherto unobtainable data.	L Kaczmarczyk|WS Jackson
26503043	Bacteria and archaea generate adaptive immunity against phages and plasmids by integrating foreign DNA of specific 30-40-base-pair lengths into clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) loci as spacer segments. The universally conserved Cas1-Cas2 integrase complex catalyses spacer acquisition using a direct nucleophilic integration mechanism similar to retroviral integrases and transposases. How the Cas1-Cas2 complex selects foreign DNA substrates for integration remains unknown. Here we present X-ray crystal structures of the Escherichia coli Cas1-Cas2 complex bound to cognate 33-nucleotide protospacer DNA substrates. The protein complex creates a curved binding surface spanning the length of the DNA and splays the ends of the protospacer to allow each terminal nucleophilic 3'-OH to enter a channel leading into the Cas1 active sites. Phosphodiester backbone interactions between the protospacer and the proteins explain the sequence-nonspecific substrate selection observed in vivo. Our results uncover the structural basis for foreign DNA capture and the mechanism by which Cas1-Cas2 functions as a molecular ruler to dictate the sequence architecture of CRISPR loci.

26502932	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated genes (cas) are widely distributed among bacteria. These systems provide adaptive immunity against mobile genetic elements specified by the spacer sequences stored within the CRISPR.	The CRISPR-Cas system has been identified using Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) against other sequenced and annotated genomes and confirmed via CRISPRfinder program. Using Polymerase Chain Reactions (PCR) and Sanger DNA sequencing, we discovered CRISPRs in additional bacterial isolates of the same species of Bordetella. Transcriptional activity and processing of the CRISPR have been assessed via RT-PCR.	Here we describe a novel Type II-C CRISPR and its associated genes-cas1, cas2, and cas9-in several isolates of a newly discovered Bordetella species. The CRISPR-cas locus, which is absent in all other Bordetella species, has a significantly lower GC-content than the genome-wide average, suggesting acquisition of this locus via horizontal gene transfer from a currently unknown source. The CRISPR array is transcribed and processed into mature CRISPR RNAs (crRNA), some of which have homology to prophages found in closely related species B. hinzii.	Expression of the CRISPR-Cas system and processing of crRNAs with perfect homology to prophages present in closely related species, but absent in that containing this CRISPR-Cas system, suggest it provides protection against phage predation. The 3,117-bp cas9 endonuclease gene from this novel CRISPR-Cas system is 990 bp smaller than that of Streptococcus pyogenes, the 4,017-bp allele currently used for genome editing, and which may make it a useful tool in various CRISPR-Cas technologies.

26501517	Epigenome editing with the CRISPR (clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats)-Cas9 platform is a promising technology for modulating gene expression to direct cell phenotype and to dissect the causal epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation. Fusions of nuclease-inactive dCas9 to the Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) repressor (dCas9-KRAB) can silence target gene expression, but the genome-wide specificity and the extent of heterochromatin formation catalyzed by dCas9-KRAB are not known. We targeted dCas9-KRAB to the HS2 enhancer, a distal regulatory element that orchestrates the expression of multiple globin genes, and observed highly specific induction of H3K9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) at the enhancer and decreased chromatin accessibility of both the enhancer and its promoter targets. Targeted epigenetic modification of HS2 silenced the expression of multiple globin genes, with minimal off-target changes in global gene expression. These results demonstrate that repression mediated by dCas9-KRAB is sufficiently specific to disrupt the activity of individual enhancers via local modification of the epigenome.

26501275	Programmable nucleases, such as zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator like effector nucleases (TALENs), and clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeats associated protein-9 (CRISPR-Cas9), hold tremendous potential for applications in the clinical setting to treat genetic diseases or prevent infectious diseases. However, because the accuracy of DNA recognition by these nucleases is not always perfect, off-target mutagenesis may result in undesirable adverse events in treated patients such as cellular toxicity or tumorigenesis. Therefore, designing nucleases and analyzing their activity must be carefully evaluated to minimize off-target mutagenesis. Furthermore, rigorous genomic testing will be important to ensure the integrity of nuclease modified cells. In this review, we provide an overview of available nuclease designing platforms, nuclease engineering approaches to minimize off-target activity, and methods to evaluate both on- and off-target cleavage of CRISPR-Cas9.

26499803	Toxoplasma gondii, an important protozoan parasite, infects almost all warm-blooded animals and humans. Although treatments in T. gondii are limited by the lack of effective drugs, some calcium-dependent kinases were demonstrated as the promising drug targets to chemotherapy against T. gondii due to their essential roles in T. gondii and absence from their hosts. The objectives of the present study were to investigate the functions of six calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPK4, CDPK4A, CDPK5, CDPK6, CDPK8, and CDPK9) in T. gondii to assess whether they are suitable for designing as drug targets. We used the CRISPR-Cas9 system to disrupt six CDPK genes successfully by insertion of DHFR* at the guide RNA-targeted region in the six endogenous CDPK loci and successfully obtained the six knockout (KO)-CDPK strains. The biological characteristics of the six strains were evaluated by plaque assays, invasion, egress, replication, and virulence assays, respectively. The results indicated that there was no significant difference between the six KO-CDPK strains and wild-type strain in virulence and the lytic cycle including invasion, egress, and replication. The conclusion was the six CDPKs are not essential for T. gondii lytic cycle and also not virulence factors for mice, suggesting that the six CDPKs may participate in other functions in T. gondii.

26498723	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) are present in the genome of 40% bacteria and 90% archaea. CRISPR and accompanying Cas proteins constitute an adaptive immune system against disruptive mobile genetic elements. Two CRISPRs and 9 genes encoding CRISPR-associated proteins have been found in the genome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The CRISPR-associated Cas2 is an endoribonuclease required for the acquisition of new spacers. In this study, Cas2 encoded by Rv2816c was expressed in Mycobacterium smegmatis lacking CRISPR-Cas system and its role in stress responses of M. smegmatis in vitro and within macrophages was studied. We found that Cas2 mediated M. smegmatis stress response changes were associated with the altered expression of sigma factors which involved in mycobacterial stress response and virulence. We also found that Cas2 decreased the survival of M. smegmatis within macrophages. This study provides new insights on the role of Cas2.	Q Huang|H Luo|M Liu|J Zeng|AE Abdalla|X Duan|Q Li|J Xie
26495836	The bacterial defense system CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) has been explored as a powerful tool to edit genomic elements. In this study, we test the potential of CRISPR Csy4 RNA endoribonuclease for targeting HIV-1. We fused human codon-optimized Csy4 endoribonuclease with VPR, a HIV-1 viral preintegration complex protein. An HIV-1 cell model was modified to allow quantitative detection of active virus production. We found that the trans-expressing VPR-Csy4 almost completely blocked viral infection in two target cell lines (SupT1, Ghost). In the MAGI cell assay, where the HIV-1 LTR β-galactosidase is expressed under the control of the tat gene from an integrated provirus, VPR-Csy4 significantly blocked the activity of the provirus-activated HIV-1 reporter. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that Csy4 endoribonuclease is a promising tool that could be tailored further to target HIV-1.	R Guo|H Wang|J Cui|G Wang|W Li|JF Hu
26493500	Human-pluripotent-stem-cell-derived kidney cells (hPSC-KCs) have important potential for disease modelling and regeneration. Whether the hPSC-KCs can reconstitute tissue-specific phenotypes is currently unknown. Here we show that hPSC-KCs self-organize into kidney organoids that functionally recapitulate tissue-specific epithelial physiology, including disease phenotypes after genome editing. In three-dimensional cultures, epiblast-stage hPSCs form spheroids surrounding hollow, amniotic-like cavities. GSK3β inhibition differentiates spheroids into segmented, nephron-like kidney organoids containing cell populations with characteristics of proximal tubules, podocytes and endothelium. Tubules accumulate dextran and methotrexate transport cargoes, and express kidney injury molecule-1 after nephrotoxic chemical injury. CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of podocalyxin causes junctional organization defects in podocyte-like cells. Knockout of the polycystic kidney disease genes PKD1 or PKD2 induces cyst formation from kidney tubules. All of these functional phenotypes are distinct from effects in epiblast spheroids, indicating that they are tissue specific. Our findings establish a reproducible, versatile three-dimensional framework for human epithelial disease modelling and regenerative medicine applications.

26494554	Although varied drugs and therapies have been developed for lung cancer treatment, in the past 5 years overall survival rates have not improved much. It has also been reported that lung cancer is diagnosed in most of the patients when it is already in the advanced stages with heterogeneous tumors where single therapy is mostly ineffective. A combination of therapies are being administered and specific genes in specific tissues are targeted while protecting normal cell, but most of the therapies face drawbacks for the development of resistance against them and tumor progression. Therefore, therapeutic implications for various therapies need to be complemented by divergent strategies. This review frames utilization of CRISPR/Cas9 for molecular targeted gene therapy leading to long-term repression and activation or inhibition of molecular targets linked to lung cancer, avoiding the cycles of therapy.

26492136	Preclinical in vivo validation of target genes for therapeutic intervention requires careful selection and characterization of the most suitable animal model in order to assess the role of these genes in a particular process or disease. To this end, genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) are typically used. However, the appropriate engineering of these models is often cumbersome and time consuming. Recently, we and others described a modular approach for fast-track modification of existing GEMMs by re-derivation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) that can be modified by recombinase-mediated transgene insertion and subsequently used for the production of chimeric mice. This 'GEMM-ESC strategy' allows for rapid in vivo analysis of gene function in the chimeras and their offspring. Moreover, this strategy is compatible with CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing. This protocol describes when and how to use the GEMM-ESC strategy effectively, and it provides a detailed procedure for re-deriving and manipulating GEMM-ESCs under feeder- and serum-free conditions. This strategy produces transgenic mice with the desired complex genotype faster than traditional methods: generation of validated GEMM-ESC clones for controlled transgene integration takes 9-12 months, and recombinase-mediated transgene integration and chimeric cohort production takes 2-3 months. The protocol requires skills in embryology, stem cell biology and molecular biology, and it is ideally performed within, or in close collaboration with, a transgenic facility.

26481349	We have developed a new, sequence-specific DNA labeling strategy that will dramatically improve DNA mapping in complex and structurally variant genomic regions, as well as facilitate high-throughput automated whole-genome mapping. The method uses the Cas9 D10A protein, which contains a nuclease disabling mutation in one of the two nuclease domains of Cas9, to create a guide RNA-directed DNA nick in the context of an in vitro-assembled CRISPR-CAS9-DNA complex. Fluorescent nucleotides are then incorporated adjacent to the nicking site with a DNA polymerase to label the guide RNA-determined target sequences. This labeling strategy is very powerful in targeting repetitive sequences as well as in barcoding genomic regions and structural variants not amenable to current labeling methods that rely on uneven distributions of restriction site motifs in the DNA. Importantly, it renders the labeled double-stranded DNA available in long intact stretches for high-throughput analysis in nanochannel arrays as well as for lower throughput targeted analysis of labeled DNA regions using alternative methods for stretching and imaging the labeled long DNA molecules. Thus, this method will dramatically improve both automated high-throughput genome-wide mapping as well as targeted analyses of complex regions containing repetitive and structurally variant DNA.

26480473	The CRISPR-Cas9 system is commonly used in biomedical research; however, the precision of Cas9 is suboptimal for applications that involve editing a large population of cells (for example, gene therapy). Variations on the standard Cas9 system have yielded improvements in the precision of targeted DNA cleavage, but they often restrict the range of targetable sequences. It remains unclear whether these variants can limit lesions to a single site in the human genome over a large cohort of treated cells. Here we show that by fusing a programmable DNA-binding domain (pDBD) to Cas9 and attenuating Cas9's inherent DNA-binding affinity, we were able to produce a Cas9-pDBD chimera with dramatically improved precision and an increased targeting range. Because the specificity and affinity of this framework can be easily tuned, Cas9-pDBDs provide a flexible system that can be tailored to achieve extremely precise genome editing at nearly any genomic locus.

26476415	Previously, we demonstrated the association between autophagy and gossypol-induced growth inhibition of mutant BRAF melanoma cells. Here, we investigate the role of autophagy in ATG5 knockout cell lines generated by the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/Cas-mediated genome editing. The MTT assay revealed that the inhibitory effect of gossypol was weaker on ATG5 knockout cells than that on the wild type (WT) cells. The conversion of non-autophagic LC3-I to autophagic LC3-II and RT-PCR confirmed the functional gene knockout. However, Cyto-ID autophagy assay revealed that gossypol induced ATG5- and LC3-independent autophagy in ATG5 knockout cells. Moreover, gossypol acts as an autophagy inducer in ATG5 knockout cells while blocking the later stages of the autophagy process in WT cells, which was determined by measuring autophagic flux after co-treatment of gossypol with chloroquine (late-stage autophagy inhibitor). On the other hand, inhibition of autophagy with 3-MA or Beclin-1 siRNA caused a partial increase in the sensitivity to gossypol in ATG5 knockout cells, but not in the WT cells. Together, our findings suggest that the resistance to gossypol in ATG5 knockout cells is associated with increased cytoprotective autophagy, independent of ATG5.	NY Kim|BI Han|M Lee
26475194	The CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering system has ignited and swept through the scientific community like wildfire. Owing largely to its efficiency, specificity, and flexibility, the CRISPR/Cas9 system has quickly become the preferred genome-editing tool of plant scientists. In plants, much of the early CRISPR/Cas9 work has been limited to proof of concept and functional studies in model systems. These studies, along with those in other fields of biology, have led to the development of several utilities of CRISPR/Cas9 beyond single gene editing. Such utilities include multiplexing for inducing multiple cleavage events, controlling gene expression, and site specific transgene insertion. With much of the conceptual CRISPR/Cas9 work nearly complete, plant researchers are beginning to apply this gene editing technology for crop trait improvement. Before rational strategies can be designed to implement this technology to engineer a wide array of crops there is a need to expand the availability of crop-specific vectors, genome resources, and transformation protocols. We anticipate that these challenges will be met along with the continued evolution of the CRISPR/Cas9 system particularly in the areas of manipulation of large genomic regions, transgene-free genetic modification, development of breeding resources, discovery of gene function, and improvements upon CRISPR/Cas9 components. The CRISPR/Cas9 editing system appears poised to transform crop trait improvement.	SM Schaeffer|PA Nakata
26474066	Type II CRISPR systems defend against invasive DNA by using Cas9 as an RNA-guided nuclease that creates double-stranded DNA breaks. Dual RNAs (CRISPR RNA [crRNA] and tracrRNA) are required for Cas9's targeting activities observed to date. Targeting requires a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) and crRNA-DNA complementarity. Cas9 orthologs (including Neisseria meningitidis Cas9 [NmeCas9]) have also been adopted for genome engineering. Here we examine the DNA cleavage activities and substrate requirements of NmeCas9, including a set of unusually complex PAM recognition patterns. Unexpectedly, NmeCas9 cleaves single-stranded DNAs in a manner that is RNA guided but PAM and tracrRNA independent. Beyond the need for guide-target pairing, this "DNase H" activity has no apparent sequence requirements, and the cleavage sites are measured from the 5' end of the DNA substrate's RNA-paired region. These results indicate that tracrRNA is not strictly required for NmeCas9 enzymatic activation, and expand the list of targeting activities of Cas9 endonucleases.

26473830	Gene knock-in techniques have rapidly evolved in recent years, along with the development and maturation of genome editing technology using programmable nucleases. We recently reported a novel strategy for microhomology-mediated end-joining-dependent integration of donor DNA by using TALEN or CRISPR/Cas9 and optimized targeting vectors, named PITCh (Precise Integration into Target Chromosome) vectors. Here we describe TALEN and PITCh vector-mediated integration of long gene cassettes, including a single-chain Fv-Fc (scFv-Fc) gene, in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, with comparison of targeting and cloning efficiency among several donor design and culture conditions. We achieved 9.6-kb whole plasmid integration and 7.6-kb backbone-free integration into a defined genomic locus in CHO cells. Furthermore, we confirmed the reasonable productivity of recombinant scFv-Fc protein of the knock-in cells. Using our protocol, the knock-in cell clones could be obtained by a single transfection and a single limiting dilution using a 96-well plate, without constructing targeting vectors containing long homology arms. Thus, the study described herein provides a highly practical strategy for gene knock-in of large DNA in CHO cells, which accelerates high-throughput generation of cell lines stably producing any desired biopharmaceuticals, including huge antibody proteins.

26470680	Targeted nucleases are widely used as tools for genome editing. Two years ago the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-associated Cas9 nuclease was used for the first time, and since then has largely revolutionized the field. The tremendous success of the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tool is powered by the ease design principle of the guide RNA that targets Cas9 to the desired DNA locus, and by the high specificity and efficiency of CRISPR/Cas9-generated DNA breaks. Several studies recently used CRISPR/Cas9 to successfully modulate disease-causing alleles in vivo in animal models and ex vivo in somatic and induced pluripotent stem cells, raising hope for therapeutic genome editing in the clinics. In this review, we will summarize and discuss such preclinical CRISPR/Cas9 gene therapy reports.	N Savić|G Schwank
26465632	Thermus aquaticus Y51MC23 was isolated from a boiling spring in the Lower Geyser Basin of Yellowstone National Park. Remarkably, this T. aquaticus strain is able to grow anaerobically and produces multiple morphological forms. Y51MC23 is a Gram-negative, rod-shaped organism that grows well between 50°C and 80°C with maximum growth rate at 65°C to 70°C. Growth studies suggest that Y51MC23 primarily scavenges protein from the environment, supported by the high number of secreted and intracellular proteases and peptidases as well as transporter systems for amino acids and peptides. The genome was assembled de novo using a 350 bp fragment library (paired end sequencing) and an 8 kb long span mate pair library. A closed and finished genome was obtained consisting of a single chromosome of 2.15 Mb and four plasmids of 11, 14, 70, and 79 kb. Unlike other Thermus species, functions usually found on megaplasmids were identified on the chromosome. The Y51MC23 genome contains two full and two partial prophage as well as numerous CRISPR loci. The high identity and synteny between Y51MC23 prophage 2 and that of Thermus sp. 2.9 is interesting, given the 8,800 km separation of the two hot springs from which they were isolated. The anaerobic lifestyle of Y51MC23 is complex, with multiple morphologies present in cultures. The use of fluorescence microscopy reveals new details about these unusual morphological features, including the presence of multiple types of large and small spheres, often forming a confluent layer of spheres. Many of the spheres appear to be formed not from cell envelope or outer membrane components as previously believed, but from a remodeled peptidoglycan cell wall. These complex morphological forms may serve multiple functions in the survival of the organism, including food and nucleic acid storage as well as colony attachment and organization.

26464492	Mutations in the DAX1 locus cause X-linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita (AHC) and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH), which manifest with primary adrenal insufficiency and incomplete or absent sexual maturation, respectively. The associated defects in spermatogenesis can range from spermatogenic arrest to Sertoli cell only syndrome. Conclusions from Dax1 knockout mouse models provide only limited insight into AHC/HH disease mechanisms, because mouse models exhibit more extensive abnormalities in testicular development, including disorganized and incompletely formed testis cords with decreased number of peritubular myoid cells and male-to-female sex reversal. We previously reported successful clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9)-mediated genome targeting in cynomolgus monkeys. Here, we describe a male fetal monkey in which targeted genome editing using CRISPR/Cas9 produced Dax1-null mutations in most somatic tissues and in the gonads. This DAX1-deficient monkey displayed defects in adrenal gland development and abnormal testis architecture with small cords, expanded blood vessels and extensive fibrosis. Sertoli cell formation was not affected. This phenotype strongly resembles findings in human patients with AHC-HH caused by mutations in DAX1. We further detected upregulation of Wnt/β-catenin-VEGF signaling in the fetal Dax1-deficient testis, suggesting abnormal activation of signaling pathways in the absence of DAX1 as one mechanism of AHC-HH. Our study reveals novel insight into the role of DAX1 in HH and provides proof-of-principle for the generation of monkey models of human disease via CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene targeting.

26460902	CRISPR-Cas systems have rapidly transitioned from intriguing prokaryotic defense systems to powerful and versatile biomolecular tools. This article reviews how these systems have been translated into technologies to manipulate bacterial genetics, physiology, and communities. Recent applications in bacteria have centered on multiplexed genome editing, programmable gene regulation, and sequence-specific antimicrobials, while future applications can build on advances in eukaryotes, the rich natural diversity of CRISPR-Cas systems, and the untapped potential of CRISPR-based DNA acquisition. Overall, these systems have formed the basis of an ever-expanding genetic toolbox and hold tremendous potential for our future understanding and engineering of the bacterial world.

26455417	Streptococcus agalactiae, or Group B streptococcus (GBS), is a highly virulent pathogen in aquatic animals, causing huge mortalities worldwide. In Thailand, the serotype Ia, β-hemolytic GBS, belonging to sequence type (ST) 7 of clonal complex (CC) 7, was found to be the major cause of streptococcosis outbreaks in fish farms. In this study, we performed an in silico genomic comparison, aiming to investigate the phylogenetic relationship between the pathogenic fish strains of Thai ST7 and other ST7 from different hosts and geographical origins. In general, the genomes of Thai ST7 strains are closely related to other fish ST7s, as the core genome is shared by 92-95% of any individual fish ST7 genome. Among the fish ST7 genomes, we observed only small dissimilarities, based on the analysis of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs), surface protein markers, insertions sequence (IS) elements and putative virulence genes. The phylogenetic tree based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the core genome sequences clearly categorized the ST7 strains according to their geographical and host origins, with the human ST7 being genetically distant from other fish ST7 strains. A pan-genome analysis of ST7 strains detected a 48-kb gene island specifically in the Thai ST7 isolates. The orientations and predicted amino acid sequences of the genes in the island closely matched those of Tn5252, a streptococcal conjugative transposon, in GBS 2603V/R serotype V, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus suis. Thus, it was presumed that Thai ST7 acquired this Tn5252 homologue from related streptococci. The close phylogenetic relationship between the fish ST7 strains suggests that these strains were derived from a common ancestor and have diverged in different geographical regions and in different hosts.

26451892	Programmable CRISPR-Cas systems have augmented our ability to produce precise genome manipulations. Here we demonstrate and characterize the ability of CRISPR-Cas derived nickases to direct targeted recombination of both small and large genomic regions flanked by repetitive elements in Escherichia coli. While CRISPR directed double-stranded DNA breaks are highly lethal in many bacteria, we show that CRISPR-guided nickase systems can be programmed to make precise, nonlethal, single-stranded incisions in targeted genomic regions. This induces recombination events and leads to targeted deletion. We demonstrate that dual-targeted nicking enables deletion of 36 and 97 Kb of the genome. Furthermore, multiplex targeting enables deletion of 133 Kb, accounting for approximately 3% of the entire E. coli genome. This technology provides a framework for methods to manipulate bacterial genomes using CRISPR-nickase systems. We envision this system working synergistically with preexisting bacterial genome engineering methods.	K Standage-Beier|Q Zhang|X Wang

26449883	Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a degenerative muscle disease caused by genetic mutations that lead to the disruption of dystrophin in muscle fibers. There is no curative treatment for this devastating disease. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat/Cas9 (CRISPR/Cas9) has emerged as a powerful tool for genetic manipulation and potential therapy. Here we demonstrate that CRIPSR-mediated genome editing efficiently excised a 23-kb genomic region on the X-chromosome covering the mutant exon 23 in a mouse model of DMD, and restored dystrophin expression and the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex at the sarcolemma of skeletal muscles in live mdx mice. Electroporation-mediated transfection of the Cas9/gRNA constructs in the skeletal muscles of mdx mice normalized the calcium sparks in response to osmotic shock. Adenovirus-mediated transduction of Cas9/gRNA greatly reduced the Evans blue dye uptake of skeletal muscles at rest and after downhill treadmill running. This study provides proof evidence for permanent gene correction in DMD.	L Xu|KH Park|L Zhao|J Xu|M El Refaey|Y Gao|H Zhu|J Ma|R Han
26449676	Among strains of Shiga-toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), seven serogroups (O26, O45, O103, O111, O121, O145, and O157) are frequently associated with severe clinical illness in humans. The development of methods for their reliable detection from complex samples such as food has been challenging thus far, and is currently based on the PCR detection of the major virulence genes stx1, stx2, and eae, and O-serogroup-specific genes. However, this approach lacks resolution. Moreover, new STEC serotypes are continuously emerging worldwide. For example, in May 2011, strains belonging to the hitherto rarely detected STEC serotype O104:H4 were identified as causative agents of one of the world's largest outbreak of disease with a high incidence of hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome in the infected patients. Discriminant typing of pathogens is crucial for epidemiological surveillance and investigations of outbreaks, and especially for tracking and tracing in case of accidental and deliberate contamination of food and water samples. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) are composed of short, highly conserved DNA repeats separated by unique sequences of similar length. This distinctive sequence signature of CRISPRs can be used for strain typing in several bacterial species including STEC. This review discusses how CRISPRs have recently been used for STEC identification and typing.	S Delannoy|L Beutin|P Fach

26446995	Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STATs) are principal transcription factors downstream of cytokine receptors. Although STAT5A is expressed in most tissues it remains to be understood why its premier, non-redundant functions are restricted to prolactin-induced mammary gland development and function. We report that the ubiquitously expressed Stat5a/b locus is subject to additional lineage-specific transcriptional control in mammary epithelium. Genome-wide surveys of epigenetic status and transcription factor occupancy uncovered a putative mammary-specific enhancer within the intergenic sequences separating the two Stat5 genes. This region exhibited several hallmarks of genomic enhancers, including DNaseI hypersensitivity, H3K27 acetylation and binding by GR, NFIB, ELF5 and MED1. Mammary-specific STAT5 binding was obtained at two canonical STAT5 binding motifs. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing was used to delete these sites in mice and determine their biological function. Mutant animals exhibited an 80% reduction of Stat5 levels in mammary epithelium and a concomitant reduction of STAT5-dependent gene expression. Transcriptome analysis identified a class of mammary-restricted genes that was particularly dependent on high STAT5 levels as a result of the intergenic enhancer. Taken together, the mammary-specific enhancer enables a positive feedback circuit that contributes to the remarkable abundance of STAT5 and, in turn, to the efficacy of STAT5-dependent mammary physiology.

26446984	Increasing incidence of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease has become one of the most challenging health issues in ageing humans. One approach to combat this is to generate genetically modified animal models of neurodegenerative disorders for studying pathogenesis, prognosis, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Owing to the genetic, anatomic, physiologic, pathologic, and neurologic similarities between pigs and humans, genetically modified pig models of neurodegenerative disorders have been attractive large animal models to bridge the gap of preclinical investigations between rodents and humans. In this review, we provide a neuroanatomical overview in pigs and summarize and discuss the generation of genetically modified pig models of neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's diseases, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal muscular atrophy, and ataxia-telangiectasia. We also highlight how non-invasive bioimaging technologies such as positron emission tomography (PET), computer tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and behavioural testing have been applied to characterize neurodegenerative pig models. We further propose a multiplex genome editing and preterm recloning (MAP) approach by using the rapid growth of the ground-breaking precision genome editing technology CRISPR/Cas9 and somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). With this approach, we hope to shorten the temporal requirement in generating multiple transgenic pigs, increase the survival rate of founder pigs, and generate genetically modified pigs that will more closely resemble the disease-causing mutations and recapitulate pathological features of human conditions.

26446710	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) in conjunction with CRISPR-associated proteins (Cas) can be employed to introduce double stand breaks into mammalian genomes at user-defined loci. The endonuclease activity of the Cas complex can be targeted to a specific genomic region using a single guide RNA (sgRNA). We developed a ligation-independent cloning (LIC) assembly method for efficient and bias-free generation of large sgRNA libraries. Using this system, we performed an iterative shotgun cloning approach to generate an arrayed sgRNA library that targets one critical exon of almost every protein-coding human gene. An orthogonal mixing and deconvolution approach was used to obtain 19,506 unique sequence-validated sgRNAs (91.4% coverage). As tested in HEK 293T cells, constructs of this library have a median genome editing activity of 54.6% and employing sgRNAs of this library to generate knockout cells was successful for 19 out of 19 genes tested.

26444151	The on-going CRISPR craze is focused on the use of Cas9-based technologies for genome editing applications in eukaryotes, with high potential for translational medicine and next-generation gene therapy. Nevertheless, CRISPR-Cas systems actually provide adaptive immunity in bacteria, and have much promise for various applications in food bacteria that include high-resolution typing of pathogens, vaccination of starter cultures against phages, and the genesis of programmable and specific antibiotics that can selectively modulate bacterial population composition. Indeed, the molecular machinery from these DNA-encoded, RNA-mediated, DNA-targeting systems can be harnessed in native hosts, or repurposed in engineered systems for a plethora of applications that can be implemented in all organisms relevant to the food chain, including agricultural crops trait-enhancement, livestock breeding, and fermentation-based manufacturing, and for the genesis of next-generation food products with enhanced quality and health-promoting functionalities. CRISPR-based applications are now poised to revolutionize many fields within food science, from farm to fork. In this review, we describe CRISPR-Cas systems and highlight their potential for the development of enhanced foods.	K Selle|R Barrangou
26434948	While human gene therapy has gained significant attention for its therapeutic promise, CRISPR/Cas9 technology has made a breakthrough as an efficient genome editing tool by emulating prokaryotic immune defense mechanisms. Although many studies have found that CRISPR/Cas9 technology is more efficient, specific and manipulable than previous generations of gene editing tools, it can be further improved by elevating its overall efficiency in a higher frequency of genome modifications and reducing its off-target effects. Here, we review the development of CRISPR/Cas9 technology, focusing on enhancement of its sequence specificity, reduction of off-target effects and delivery systems. Moreover, we describe recent successful applications of CRISPR/Cas9 technology in laboratory and clinical studies.	YI Jo|B Suresh|H Kim|S Ramakrishna

CRISPR has quickly become the preferred tool for genetic manipulation, and shows incredible promise as a platform for studying gene function in vivo. I discuss the current application of CRISPR technology to create new in vivo disease models, with a particular focus on how these tools, derived from an adaptive bacterial immune system, are helping us to better model the complexity of human cancer.

26431037	Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Choleraesuis is a highly invasive pathogen of swine that frequently causes serious outbreaks, in particular in Asia, and can also cause severe invasive disease in humans. In this study, 21 S. Choleraesuis isolates, detected from 21 patients with diarrhea in China between 2010 and 2011, were found to include 19 H2S-negative S. Choleraesuis isolates and two H2S-positive isolates. This is the first report of H2S-negative S. Choleraesuis isolated from humans. The majority of H2S-negative isolates exhibited high resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, tetracycline, ticarcillin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, but only six isolates were resistant to norfloxacin. In contrast, all of the isolates were sensitive to cephalosporins. Fifteen isolates were found to be multidrug resistant. In norfloxacin-resistant isolates, we detected mutations in the gyrA and parC genes and identified two new mutations in the parC gene. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) analysis were employed to investigate the genetic relatedness of H2S-negative and H2S-positive S. Choleraesuis isolates. PFGE revealed two groups, with all 19 H2S-negative S. Choleraesuis isolates belonging to Group I and H2S-positive isolates belonging to Group II. By MLST analysis, the H2S-negative isolates were all found to belong to ST68 and H2S-positive isolates belong to ST145. By CRISPR analysis, no significant differences in CRISPR 1 were detected; however, one H2S-negative isolate was found to contain three new spacers in CRISPR 2. All 19 H2S-negative isolates also possessed a frame-shift mutation at position 760 of phsA gene compared with H2S-positive isolates, which may be responsible for the H2S-negative phenotype. Moreover, the 19 H2S-negative isolates have similar PFGE patterns and same mutation site in the phsA gene, these results indicated that these H2S-negative isolates may have been prevalent in China. These findings suggested that surveillance should be increased of H2S-negative S. Choleraesuis in China.	J Xie|S Yi|J Zhu|P Li|B Liang|H Li|X Yang|L Wang|R Hao|L Jia|Z Wu|S Qiu|H Song
26430154	Advances in genome engineering technologies have made the precise control over genome sequence and regulation possible across a variety of disciplines. These tools can expand our understanding of fundamental biological processes and create new opportunities for therapeutic designs. The rapid evolution of these methods has also catalyzed a new era of genomics that includes multiple approaches to functionally characterize and manipulate the regulation of genomic information. Here, we review the recent advances of the most widely adopted genome engineering platforms and their application to functional genomics. This includes engineered zinc finger proteins, TALEs/TALENs, and the CRISPR/Cas9 system as nucleases for genome editing, transcription factors for epigenome editing, and other emerging applications. We also present current and potential future applications of these tools, as well as their current limitations and areas for future advances.	IB Hilton|CA Gersbach

26416877	The THAP11 and ZNF143 transcription factors recognize overlapping DNA sequences and are reported to exhibit signs of both competitive and cooperative binding. HCFC1 serves as a scaffold protein, bridging interactions between transcription factors, including THAP11 and ZNF143, and transcriptional coregulators. The exact mechanism of how DNA sequences guide the recruitment of the THAP11/ZNF143/HCFC1 complex to chromatin is still controversial. In this study, we use chromosomally integrated synthetic constructs and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas9-mediated approaches in intact cells to elucidate the role of the DNA sequence in the recruitment of this complex and to establish its biological relevance. We show that the ACTACA submotif, shared by both THAP11 and ZNF143, directs the recruitment of THAP11 and HCFC1 to ZNF143-occupied loci. Importantly, its position, spacing, and orientation relative to the ZNF143 core motif are critical for this action. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated alterations of the ACTACA submotif at endogenous promoters recapitulated results obtained with synthetic constructs and resulted in altered gene transcription and histone modifications at targeted promoters. Our in vivo approaches provide strong evidence for the molecular role of the ACTACA submotif in THAP11, ZNF143, and HCFC1 cooperative recruitment to chromatin and its biological role in target gene expression.

26416740	The battle for survival between bacteria and the viruses that infect them (phages) has led to the evolution of many bacterial defence systems and phage-encoded antagonists of these systems. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and the CRISPR-associated (cas) genes comprise an adaptive immune system that is one of the most widespread means by which bacteria defend themselves against phages. We identified the first examples of proteins produced by phages that inhibit a CRISPR-Cas system. Here we performed biochemical and in vivo investigations of three of these anti-CRISPR proteins, and show that each inhibits CRISPR-Cas activity through a distinct mechanism. Two block the DNA-binding activity of the CRISPR-Cas complex, yet do this by interacting with different protein subunits, and using steric or non-steric modes of inhibition. The third anti-CRISPR protein operates by binding to the Cas3 helicase-nuclease and preventing its recruitment to the DNA-bound CRISPR-Cas complex. In vivo, this anti-CRISPR can convert the CRISPR-Cas system into a transcriptional repressor, providing the first example-to our knowledge-of modulation of CRISPR-Cas activity by a protein interactor. The diverse sequences and mechanisms of action of these anti-CRISPR proteins imply an independent evolution, and foreshadow the existence of other means by which proteins may alter CRISPR-Cas function.

26415723	Functional genomics (FG) screens, using RNAi or CRISPR technology, have become a standard tool for systematic, genome-wide loss-of-function studies for therapeutic target discovery. As in many large-scale assays, however, off-target effects, variable reagents' potency and experimental noise must be accounted for appropriately control for false positives. Indeed, rigorous statistical analysis of high-throughput FG screening data remains challenging, particularly when integrative analyses are used to combine multiple sh/sgRNAs targeting the same gene in the library.	We use large RNAi and CRISPR repositories that are publicly available to evaluate a novel meta-analysis approach for FG screens via Bayesian hierarchical modeling, Screening Bayesian Evaluation and Analysis Method (ScreenBEAM).	Results from our analysis show that the proposed strategy, which seamlessly combines all available data, robustly outperforms classical algorithms developed for microarray data sets as well as recent approaches designed for next generation sequencing technologies. Remarkably, the ScreenBEAM algorithm works well even when the quality of FG screens is relatively low, which accounts for about 80-95% of the public datasets.

26414877	The recent development of gene editing tools and methodology for use in livestock enables the production of new animal disease models. These tools facilitate site-specific mutation of the genome, allowing animals carrying known human disease mutations to be produced. In this review, we describe the various gene editing tools and how they can be used for a range of large animal models of diseases. This genomic technology is in its infancy but the expectation is that through the use of gene editing tools we will see a dramatic increase in animal model resources available for both the study of human disease and the translation of this knowledge into the clinic. Comparative pathology will be central to the productive use of these animal models and the successful translation of new therapeutic strategies.	CB Whitelaw|TP Sheets|SG Lillico|BP Telugu
26413608	Gene editing technology has been at its mature stage with the successful development of TALENs and CRISPR/Cas enzymes. The genetically modified endonucleases of ZFNs, TALENs, and CRISPR/Cas are widely used in the development of genetically modified cells or organisms. Among the enzymes that possess gene editing ability, CRISPR/Cas is the latest member with high efficiency in gene editing and simplicity in cloning. This review discusses the discovery of CRISPR, the development of the CRISPR/Cas system, and its applications as a new gene editing system.

26411613	In recent years the term 'Lamarckian evolution' has become a household name for processes that do not follow classical Mendelian pattern of inheritance, and it is seen as a relevant complement to Darwinism. In this article I argue that bringing back Lamarck is unjustified and misleading.	A Weiss
26406380	Bacteria and archaea have evolved sophisticated adaptive immune systems that reply on CRISPR loci and a diverse cassette of Cas genes that are classified into three main types and at least eleven subtypes. All CRISPR-Cas immune systems operate through three main stages: acquisition, biogenesis, and interference. This SnapShot summarizes our current knowledge of these fascinating immune systems.

26404154	RNA-guided Cas9 nucleases derived from clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas systems have recently been adapted as sequence-programmable tools for various purposes such as genome editing and transcriptional regulation. A critical aspect of the system is the selection and validation of spacer sequences that allow precise targeting of the guide RNA-Cas9 complex. We describe a procedure involving computational and experimental steps to identify and test potentially interesting spacer sequences in bacterial genomes.	F Grenier|JF Lucier|S Rodrigue
26398194	Clustered, Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats and their associated Cas proteins (CRISPR-Cas) provide prokaryotes with a mechanism for defense against mobile genetic elements (MGEs). A CRISPR locus is a molecular memory of MGE encounters. It contains an array of short sequences, called spacers, that generally have sequence identity to MGEs. Three different CRISPR loci have been identified among strains of the opportunistic pathogen Enterococcus faecalis. CRISPR1 and CRISPR3 are associated with the cas genes necessary for blocking MGEs, but these loci are present in only a subset of E. faecalis strains. The orphan CRISPR2 lacks cas genes and is ubiquitous in E. faecalis, although its spacer content varies from strain to strain. Because CRISPR2 is a variable locus occurring in all E. faecalis, comparative analysis of CRISPR2 sequences may provide information about the clonality of E. faecalis strains. We examined CRISPR2 sequences from 228 E. faecalis genomes in relationship to subspecies phylogenetic lineages (sequence types; STs) determined by multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and to a genome phylogeny generated for a representative 71 genomes. We found that specific CRISPR2 sequences are associated with specific STs and with specific branches on the genome tree. To explore possible applications of CRISPR2 analysis, we evaluated 14 E. faecalis bloodstream isolates using CRISPR2 analysis and MLST. CRISPR2 analysis identified two groups of clonal strains among the 14 isolates, an assessment that was confirmed by MLST. CRISPR2 analysis was also used to accurately predict the ST of a subset of isolates. We conclude that CRISPR2 analysis, while not a replacement for MLST, is an inexpensive method to assess clonality among E. faecalis isolates, and can be used in conjunction with MLST to identify recombination events occurring between STs.

26397828	Genome modification technologies are powerful tools for molecular biology and related areas. Advances in animal transgenesis and genome editing technologies during the past three decades allowed systematic interrogation of gene function that can help model how the genome influences cellular physiology. Genetic engineering via homologous recombination (HR) has been the standard method to modify genomic sequences. Nevertheless, nuclease-guided genome editing methods that were developed recently, such as ZFN, TALEN and CRISPR/Cas, opened new perspectives for biomedical research. Here, we present a brief historical perspective of genome modification methods, focusing on transgenic mice models. Moreover, we describe how new techniques were discovered and improved, present the paradigm shifts and discuss their limitations and applications for biomedical research as well as possible future directions.

26394009	Bacterial CRISPR-Cas systems provide insight into recent population history because they rapidly incorporate, in a unidirectional manner, short fragments (spacers) from coexisting infective virus populations into host chromosomes. Immunity is achieved by sequence identity between transcripts of spacers and their targets. Here, we used metagenomics to study the stability and dynamics of the type I-E CRISPR-Cas locus of Leptospirillum group II bacteria in biofilms sampled over 5 years from an acid mine drainage (AMD) system. Despite recovery of 452,686 spacers from CRISPR amplicons and metagenomic data, rarefaction curves of spacers show no saturation. The vast repertoire of spacers is attributed to phage/plasmid population diversity and retention of old spacers, despite rapid evolution of the targeted phage/plasmid genome regions (proto-spacers). The oldest spacers (spacers found at the trailer end) are conserved for at least 5 years, and 12% of these retain perfect or near-perfect matches to proto-spacer targets. The majority of proto-spacer regions contain an AAG proto-spacer adjacent motif (PAM). Spacers throughout the locus target the same phage population (AMDV1), but there are blocks of consecutive spacers without AMDV1 target sequences. Results suggest long-term coexistence of Leptospirillum with AMDV1 and periods when AMDV1 was less dominant. Metagenomics can be applied to millions of cells in a single sample to provide an extremely large spacer inventory, allow identification of phage/plasmids and enable analysis of previous phage/plasmid exposure. Thus, this approach can provide insights into prior bacterial environment and genetic interplay between hosts and their viruses.	CL Sun|BC Thomas|R Barrangou|JF Banfield
26390243	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most lethal human cancers and shows resistance to any therapeutic strategy used. Here we tested small-molecule inhibitors targeting chromatin regulators as possible therapeutic agents in PDAC. We show that JQ1, an inhibitor of the bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) family of proteins, suppresses PDAC development in mice by inhibiting both MYC activity and inflammatory signals. The histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor SAHA synergizes with JQ1 to augment cell death and more potently suppress advanced PDAC. Finally, using a CRISPR-Cas9-based method for gene editing directly in the mouse adult pancreas, we show that de-repression of p57 (also known as KIP2 or CDKN1C) upon combined BET and HDAC inhibition is required for the induction of combination therapy-induced cell death in PDAC. SAHA is approved for human use, and molecules similar to JQ1 are being tested in clinical trials. Thus, these studies identify a promising epigenetic-based therapeutic strategy that may be rapidly implemented in fatal human tumors.

26382709	Clinical diagnostic sequencing currently focuses on identifying causal mutations in the exome, wherein most disease-causing mutations are known to occur. The rest of the genome is mostly comprised of regulatory elements that control gene expression, but these have remained largely unexplored in clinical diagnostics due to the high cost of whole genome sequencing and interpretive challenges. The purpose of this review is to illustrate examples of diseases caused by mutations in regulatory elements and introduce the diagnostic potential for whole genome sequencing. Different classes of functional elements and chromatin structure are described to provide the clinician with a foundation for understanding the basis of these mutations.	The utilization of whole-genome sequence data, epigenomic maps and induced pluripotent stem (IPS) cell technologies facilitated the discovery that mutations in the pancreas-specific transcription factor 1a enhancer can cause isolated pancreatic agenesis. High resolution array comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH), whole-genome sequencing, maps of 3-D chromatin architecture, and mouse models generated using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas were used to show that disruption of topological-associated domain boundary elements cause limb defects. Structural variants that reposition enhancers in somatic cells have also been described in cancer.	Although not ready for diagnostics, new technologies, epigenomic maps, and improved knowledge of chromatin architecture will soon enable a better understanding and diagnostic solutions for currently unexplained genetic disorders.

26375006	Enhancers, critical determinants of cellular identity, are commonly recognized by correlative chromatin marks and gain-of-function potential, although only loss-of-function studies can demonstrate their requirement in the native genomic context. Previously, we identified an erythroid enhancer of human BCL11A, subject to common genetic variation associated with the fetal haemoglobin level, the mouse orthologue of which is necessary for erythroid BCL11A expression. Here we develop pooled clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas9 guide RNA libraries to perform in situ saturating mutagenesis of the human and mouse enhancers. This approach reveals critical minimal features and discrete vulnerabilities of these enhancers. Despite conserved function of the composite enhancers, their architecture diverges. The crucial human sequences appear to be primate-specific. Through editing of primary human progenitors and mouse transgenesis, we validate the BCL11A erythroid enhancer as a target for fetal haemoglobin reinduction. The detailed enhancer map will inform therapeutic genome editing, and the screening approach described here is generally applicable to functional interrogation of non-coding genomic elements.

26370991	Comprehensive understanding of genome functions requires identification of molecules (proteins, RNAs, genomic regions, etc.) bound to specific genomic regions of interest in vivo. To perform biochemical and molecular biological analysis of specific genomic regions, we developed engineered DNA-binding molecule-mediated chromatin immunoprecipitation (enChIP) to purify genomic regions of interest. In enChIP, specific genomic regions are tagged for biochemical purification using engineered DNA-binding molecules, such as transcription activator-like (TAL) proteins and a catalytically inactive form of the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) system. enChIP is a comprehensive approach that emphasizes non-biased search using next-generation sequencing (NGS), microarrays, mass spectrometry (MS), and other methods. Moreover, this approach is not restricted to cultured cell lines and can be easily extended to organisms. In this review, we discuss applications of enChIP to elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying genome functions.	H Fujii|T Fujita

26370509	CRISPR-Cas9 technology has rapidly changed the landscape for how biologists and bioengineers study and manipulate the genome. Derived from the bacterial adaptive immune system, CRISPR-Cas9 has been coopted and repurposed for a variety of new functions, including the activation or repression of gene expression (termed CRISPRa or CRISPRi, respectively). This represents an exciting alternative to previously used repression or activation technologies such as RNA interference (RNAi) or the use of gene overexpression vectors. We have only just begun exploring the possibilities that CRISPR technology offers for gene regulation and the control of cell identity and behavior. In this review, we describe the recent advances of CRISPR-Cas9 technology for gene regulation and outline advantages and disadvantages of CRISPRa and CRISPRi (CRISPRa/i) relative to alternative technologies.

26364721	In many bacteria and archaea, an adaptive immune system (CRISPR-Cas) provides immunity against foreign genetic elements. This system uses CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) derived from the CRISPR array, along with CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins, to target foreign nucleic acids. In most CRISPR systems, endonucleolytic processing of crRNA precursors (pre-crRNAs) is essential for the pathway. Here we study the Cas6 endonuclease responsible for crRNA processing in the Type III-A CRISPR-Cas system from Staphylococcus epidermidis RP62a, a model for Type III-A CRISPR-Cas systems, and define substrate requirements for SeCas6 activity. We find that SeCas6 is necessary and sufficient for full-length crRNA biogenesis in vitro, and that it relies on both sequence and stem-loop structure in the 3' half of the CRISPR repeat for recognition and processing.

26363124	In this review we briefly describe the development of CRISPR tools for genome editing and control of transcription in bacteria.

26360626	The Streptococcus-derived CRISPR/Cas9 system is being widely used to perform targeted gene modifications in plants. This customized endonuclease system has two components, the single-guide RNA (sgRNA) for target DNA recognition and the CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) for DNA cleavage. Ubiquitously expressed CRISPR/Cas9 systems (UC) generate targeted gene modifications with high efficiency but only those produced in reproductive cells are transmitted to the next generation. We report the design and characterization of a germ-line-specific Cas9 system (GSC) for Arabidopsis gene modification in male gametocytes, constructed using a SPOROCYTELESS (SPL) genomic expression cassette. Four loci in two endogenous genes were targeted by both systems for comparative analysis. Mutations generated by the GSC system were rare in T1 plants but were abundant (30%) in the T2 generation. The vast majority (70%) of the T2 mutant population generated using the UC system were chimeras while the newly developed GSC system produced only 29% chimeras, with 70% of the T2 mutants being heterozygous. Analysis of two loci in the T2 population showed that the abundance of heritable gene mutations was 37% higher in the GSC system compared to the UC system and the level of polymorphism of the mutations was also dramatically increased with the GSC system. Two additional systems based on germ-line-specific promoters (pDD45-GT and pLAT52-GT) were also tested, and one of them was capable of generating heritable homozygous T1 mutant plants. Our results suggest that future application of the described GSC system will facilitate the screening for targeted gene modifications, especially lethal mutations in the T2 population.

26358729	We present Cas-Designer, a user-friendly program to aid researchers in choosing appropriate target sites in a gene of interest for type II CRISPR/Cas-derived RNA-guided endonucleases, which are now widely used for biomedical research and biotechnology. Cas-Designer rapidly provides the list of all possible guide RNA sequences in a given input DNA sequence and their potential off-target sites including bulge-type sites in a genome of choice.

26355004	Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by next-generation DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) is a widely used technique for identifying transcription factor (TF) binding events throughout an entire genome. However, ChIP-seq is limited by the availability of suitable ChIP-seq grade antibodies, and the vast majority of commercially available antibodies fail to generate usable data sets. To ameliorate these technical obstacles, we present a robust methodological approach for performing ChIP-seq through epitope tagging of endogenous TFs. We used clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9-based genome editing technology to develop CRISPR epitope tagging ChIP-seq (CETCh-seq) of DNA-binding proteins. We assessed the feasibility of CETCh-seq by tagging several DNA-binding proteins spanning a wide range of endogenous expression levels in the hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2. Our data exhibit strong correlations between both replicate types as well as with standard ChIP-seq approaches that use TF antibodies. Notably, we also observed minimal changes to the cellular transcriptome and to the expression of the tagged TF. To examine the robustness of our technique, we further performed CETCh-seq in the breast adenocarcinoma cell line MCF7 as well as mouse embryonic stem cells and observed similarly high correlations. Collectively, these data highlight the applicability of CETCh-seq to accurately define the genome-wide binding profiles of DNA-binding proteins, allowing for a straightforward methodology to potentially assay the complete repertoire of TFs, including the large fraction for which ChIP-quality antibodies are not available.

26350210	Type I CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats)-Cas (CRISPR-associated) systems exist in bacterial and archaeal organisms and provide immunity against foreign DNA. The Cas protein content of the DNA interference complexes (termed Cascade) varies between different CRISPR-Cas subtypes. A minimal variant of the Type I-F system was identified in proteobacterial species including Shewanella putrefaciens CN-32. This variant lacks a large subunit (Csy1), Csy2 and Csy3 and contains two unclassified cas genes. The genome of S. putrefaciens CN-32 contains only five Cas proteins (Cas1, Cas3, Cas6f, Cas1821 and Cas1822) and a single CRISPR array with 81 spacers. RNA-Seq analyses revealed the transcription of this array and the maturation of crRNAs (CRISPR RNAs). Interference assays based on plasmid conjugation demonstrated that this CRISPR-Cas system is active in vivo and that activity is dependent on the recognition of the dinucleotide GG PAM (Protospacer Adjacent Motif) sequence and crRNA abundance. The deletion of cas1821 and cas1822 reduced the cellular crRNA pool. Recombinant Cas1821 was shown to form helical filaments bound to RNA molecules, which suggests its role as the Cascade backbone protein. A Cascade complex was isolated which contained multiple Cas1821 copies, Cas1822, Cas6f and mature crRNAs.	S Dwarakanath|S Brenzinger|D Gleditzsch|A Plagens|A Klingl|K Thormann|L Randau
26348136	Matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP13, collagenase-3) is a vital component for chondrocyte and osteoblast maturation, and is aberrantly expressed in numerous disease states. At the transcriptional level, Mmp13 is controlled by many different growth factors and hormones. Most notably, Mmp13 is regulated by the vitamin D hormone (1,25(OH)2D3), parathyroid hormone (PTH), and several cytokines. These activities occur through participation by the transcription factors VDR, RUNX2, FOS, JUN, and Osterix (OSX), respectively. Recently, we discovered that Mmp13 is regulated by elements quite distal to the transcriptional start site -10, -20, and -30kb upstream. These enhancers, along with minor contributions from the region proximal to the promoter, are responsible for the ligand inducible and, most strikingly, the basal activities of Mmp13 gene regulation. Here, we found that the actions of PTH and OSX do not occur through the -10kb VDR bound enhancer. Rather, the -30kb RUNX2 bound enhancer and the promoter proximal regions were essential for activity. Through RUNX2 deletion and OSX overexpression in cells, we showed a specific role for OSX in Mmp13 regulation. Finally, we created an in vivo CRISPR deleted -10kb enhancer mouse model. Despite normal bone density and growth, they fail to up-regulate Mmp13 in response to 1,25(OH)2D3. These data are consistent with those obtained through UAMS osteoblast cell culture and further define the specific roles of distal enhancers in the regulation of Mmp13.

26338188	CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats)-Cas (CRISPR-associated) systems are sequence-specific adaptive defenses against phages and plasmids which are widespread in prokaryotes. Here we have studied whether phylogenetic relatedness or sharing of environmental niches affects the distribution and dissemination of Type II CRISPR-Cas systems, first in 132 bacterial genomes from 15 phylogenetic classes, ranging from Proteobacteria to Actinobacteria. There was clustering of distinct Type II CRISPR-Cas systems in phylogenetically distinct genera with varying G+C%, which share environmental niches. The distribution of CRISPR-Cas within a genus was studied using a large collection of genome sequences of the closely related Campylobacter species Campylobacter jejuni (N = 3,746) and Campylobacter coli (N = 486). The Cas gene cas9 and CRISPR-repeat are almost universally present in C. jejuni genomes (98.0% positive) but relatively rare in C. coli genomes (9.6% positive). Campylobacter jejuni and agricultural C. coli isolates share the C. jejuni CRISPR-Cas system, which is closely related to, but distinct from the C. coli CRISPR-Cas system found in C. coli isolates from nonagricultural sources. Analysis of the genomic position of CRISPR-Cas insertion suggests that the C. jejuni-type CRISPR-Cas has been transferred to agricultural C. coli. Conversely, the absence of the C. coli-type CRISPR-Cas in agricultural C. coli isolates may be due to these isolates not sharing the same environmental niche, and may be affected by farm hygiene and biosecurity practices in the agricultural sector. Finally, many CRISPR spacer alleles were linked with specific multilocus sequence types, suggesting that these can assist molecular epidemiology applications for C. jejuni and C. coli.

26334116	Current antiviral therapies cannot cure hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection; successful HBV eradication would require inactivation of the viral genome, which primarily persists in host cells as episomal covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) and, to a lesser extent, as chromosomally integrated sequences. However, novel designer enzymes, such as the CRISPR/Cas9 RNA-guided nuclease system, provide technologies for developing advanced therapy strategies that could directly attack the HBV genome. For therapeutic application in humans, such designer nucleases should recognize various HBV genotypes and cause minimal off-target effects. Here, we identified cross-genotype conserved HBV sequences in the S and X region of the HBV genome that were targeted for specific and effective cleavage by a Cas9 nickase. This approach disrupted not only episomal cccDNA and chromosomally integrated HBV target sites in reporter cell lines, but also HBV replication in chronically and de novo infected hepatoma cell lines. Our data demonstrate the feasibility of using the CRISPR/Cas9 nickase system for novel therapy strategies aiming to cure HBV infection.

26327282	Clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) act as an adaptive RNA-mediated immune mechanism in bacteria. They can also be used for identification and evolutionary studies based on polymorphisms within the CRISPR locus. We amplified and analyzed 6 CRISPR loci from 237 Shigella strains belonging to the 4 species groups, as well as 13 Escherichia coli strains. The CRISPR-associated (cas) gene sequence arrays of these strains were screened and compared. The CRISPR sequences from Shigella were conserved among subtypes, suggesting that CRISPR may represent a new identification tool for the detection and discrimination of Shigella species. Secondary structure analysis showed a different stem-loop structure at the terminal repeat, suggesting a distinct recognition mechanism in the formation of crRNA. In addition, the presence of "self-target" spacers and polymorphisms within CRISPR in Shigella indicated a selective pressure for inhibition of this system, which has the potential to damage "self DNA." Homology analysis of spacers showed that CRISPR might be involved in the regulation of virulence transmission. Phylogenetic analysis based on CRISPR sequences from Shigella and E. coli indicated that although phenotypic properties maintain convergent evolution, the 4 Shigella species do not represent natural groupings. Surprisingly, comparative analysis of Shigella repeats with other species provided new evidence for CRISPR horizontal transfer. Our results suggested that CRISPR analysis is applicable for the detection of Shigella species and for investigation of evolutionary relationships.

26324940	Direct visualization of genomic loci in the 3D nucleus is important for understanding the spatial organization of the genome and its association with gene expression. Various DNA FISH methods have been developed in the past decades, all involving denaturing dsDNA and hybridizing fluorescent nucleic acid probes. Here we report a novel approach that uses in vitro constituted nuclease-deficient clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated caspase 9 (Cas9) complexes as probes to label sequence-specific genomic loci fluorescently without global DNA denaturation (Cas9-mediated fluorescence in situ hybridization, CASFISH). Using fluorescently labeled nuclease-deficient Cas9 (dCas9) protein assembled with various single-guide RNA (sgRNA), we demonstrated rapid and robust labeling of repetitive DNA elements in pericentromere, centromere, G-rich telomere, and coding gene loci. Assembling dCas9 with an array of sgRNAs tiling arbitrary target loci, we were able to visualize nonrepetitive genomic sequences. The dCas9/sgRNA binary complex is stable and binds its target DNA with high affinity, allowing sequential or simultaneous probing of multiple targets. CASFISH assays using differently colored dCas9/sgRNA complexes allow multicolor labeling of target loci in cells. In addition, the CASFISH assay is remarkably rapid under optimal conditions and is applicable for detection in primary tissue sections. This rapid, robust, less disruptive, and cost-effective technology adds a valuable tool for basic research and genetic diagnosis.	W Deng|X Shi|R Tjian|T Lionnet|RH Singer
26322839	CRISPR-Cas9 technology provides a powerful system for genome engineering. However, variable activity across different single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) remains a significant limitation. We analyzed the molecular features that influence sgRNA stability, activity and loading into Cas9 in vivo. We observed that guanine enrichment and adenine depletion increased sgRNA stability and activity, whereas differential sgRNA loading, nucleosome positioning and Cas9 off-target binding were not major determinants. We also identified sgRNAs truncated by one or two nucleotides and containing 5' mismatches as efficient alternatives to canonical sgRNAs. On the basis of these results, we created a predictive sgRNA-scoring algorithm, CRISPRscan, that effectively captures the sequence features affecting the activity of CRISPR-Cas9 in vivo. Finally, we show that targeting Cas9 to the germ line using a Cas9-nanos 3' UTR led to the generation of maternal-zygotic mutants, as well as increased viability and decreased somatic mutations. These results identify determinants that influence Cas9 activity and provide a framework for the design of highly efficient sgRNAs for genome targeting in vivo.

26321643	Mutations of the Janus family kinase JAK3 gene cause severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). JAK3 deficiency in humans is characterized by the absence of circulating T cells and natural killer (NK) cells with normal numbers of poorly functioning B cells (T(-)B(+)NK(-)). Using SCID patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and a T cell in vitro differentiation system, we demonstrate a complete block in early T cell development of JAK3-deficient cells. Correction of the JAK3 mutation by CRISPR/Cas9-enhanced gene targeting restores normal T cell development, including the production of mature T cell populations with a broad T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire. Whole-genome sequencing of corrected cells demonstrates no CRISPR/Cas9 off-target modifications. These studies describe an approach for the study of human lymphopoiesis and provide a foundation for gene correction therapy in humans with immunodeficiencies.

26310292	CRISPR-Cas9 represents a promising platform for genome editing, yet means for its safe and efficient delivery remain to be fully realized. A novel vehicle that simultaneously delivers the Cas9 protein and single guide RNA (sgRNA) is based on DNA nanoclews, yarn-like DNA nanoparticles that are synthesized by rolling circle amplification. The biologically inspired vehicles were efficiently loaded with Cas9/sgRNA complexes and delivered the complexes to the nuclei of human cells, thus enabling targeted gene disruption while maintaining cell viability. Editing was most efficient when the DNA nanoclew sequence and the sgRNA guide sequence were partially complementary, offering a design rule for enhancing delivery. Overall, this strategy provides a versatile method that could be adapted for delivering other DNA-binding proteins or functional nucleic acids.	W Sun|W Ji|JM Hall|Q Hu|C Wang|CL Beisel|Z Gu
26305040	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 technology is an important tool for genome editing because the Cas9 endonuclease can induce targeted DNA double-strand breaks. Targeting of the DNA break is typically controlled by a single-guide RNA (sgRNA), a chimeric RNA containing a structural segment important for Cas9 binding and a 20mer guide sequence that hybridizes to the genomic DNA target. Previous studies have demonstrated that CRISPR-Cas9 technology can be used for efficient, marker-free genome editing in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, introducing the 20mer guide sequence into yeast sgRNA expression vectors often requires cloning procedures that are complex, time-consuming and/or expensive. To simplify this process, we have developed a new sgRNA expression cassette with internal restriction enzyme sites that permit rapid, directional cloning of 20mer guide sequences. Here we describe a flexible set of vectors based on this design for cloning and expressing sgRNAs (and Cas9) in yeast using different selectable markers. We anticipate that the Cas9-sgRNA expression vector with the URA3 selectable marker (pML104) will be particularly useful for genome editing in yeast, since the Cas9 machinery can be easily removed by counter-selection using 5-fluoro-orotic acid (5-FOA) following successful genome editing. The availability of new vectors that simplify and streamline the technical steps required for guide sequence cloning should help accelerate the use of CRISPR-Cas9 technology in yeast genome editing.

26299960	Lung disease is a major cause of death in the United States, with current therapeutic approaches serving only to manage symptoms. The most common chronic and life-threatening genetic disease of the lung is cystic fibrosis (CF) caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR). We have generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from CF patients carrying a homozygous deletion of F508 in the CFTR gene, which results in defective processing of CFTR to the cell membrane. This mutation was precisely corrected using CRISPR to target corrective sequences to the endogenous CFTR genomic locus, in combination with a completely excisable selection system, which significantly improved the efficiency of this correction. The corrected iPSCs were subsequently differentiated to mature airway epithelial cells where recovery of normal CFTR expression and function was demonstrated. This isogenic iPSC-based model system for CF could be adapted for the development of new therapeutic approaches.

26297561	Bacteria encode clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) and CRISPR-associated genes (cas), which collectively form an RNA-guided adaptive immune system against invasive genetic elements. In silico surveys have revealed that lactic acid bacteria harbour a prolific and diverse set of CRISPR-Cas systems. Thus, the natural evolutionary role of CRISPR-Cas systems may be investigated in these ecologically, industrially, scientifically and medically important microbes. In this study, 17 Lactobacillus gasseri strains were investigated and 6 harboured a type II-A CRISPR-Cas system, with considerable diversity in array size and spacer content. Several of the spacers showed similarity to phage and plasmid sequences, which are typical targets of CRISPR-Cas immune systems. Aligning the protospacers facilitated inference of the protospacer adjacent motif sequence, determined to be 5'-NTAA-3' flanking the 3' end of the protospacer. The system in L. gasseri JV-V03 and NCK 1342 interfered with transforming plasmids containing sequences matching the most recently acquired CRISPR spacers in each strain. We report the distribution and function of a native type II-A CRISPR-Cas system in the commensal species L. gasseri. Collectively, these results open avenues for applications for bacteriophage protection and genome modification in L. gasseri, and contribute to the fundamental understanding of CRISPR-Cas systems in bacteria.

26297141	The relative ease, speed, and biological scope of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated Protein9 (Cas9)-based reagents for genomic manipulations are revolutionizing virtually all areas of molecular biosciences, including functional genomics, genetics, applied biomedical research, and agricultural biotechnology. In plant systems, however, a number of hurdles currently exist that limit this technology from reaching its full potential. For example, significant plant molecular biology expertise and effort is still required to generate functional expression constructs that allow simultaneous editing, and especially transcriptional regulation, of multiple different genomic loci or multiplexing, which is a significant advantage of CRISPR/Cas9 versus other genome-editing systems. To streamline and facilitate rapid and wide-scale use of CRISPR/Cas9-based technologies for plant research, we developed and implemented a comprehensive molecular toolbox for multifaceted CRISPR/Cas9 applications in plants. This toolbox provides researchers with a protocol and reagents to quickly and efficiently assemble functional CRISPR/Cas9 transfer DNA constructs for monocots and dicots using Golden Gate and Gateway cloning methods. It comes with a full suite of capabilities, including multiplexed gene editing and transcriptional activation or repression of plant endogenous genes. We report the functionality and effectiveness of this toolbox in model plants such as tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana), Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), and rice (Oryza sativa), demonstrating its utility for basic and applied plant research.

26287746	Genomewide association studies can be used to identify disease-relevant genomic regions, but interpretation of the data is challenging. The FTO region harbors the strongest genetic association with obesity, yet the mechanistic basis of this association remains elusive.	We examined epigenomic data, allelic activity, motif conservation, regulator expression, and gene coexpression patterns, with the aim of dissecting the regulatory circuitry and mechanistic basis of the association between the FTO region and obesity. We validated our predictions with the use of directed perturbations in samples from patients and from mice and with endogenous CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing in samples from patients.	Our data indicate that the FTO allele associated with obesity represses mitochondrial thermogenesis in adipocyte precursor cells in a tissue-autonomous manner. The rs1421085 T-to-C single-nucleotide variant disrupts a conserved motif for the ARID5B repressor, which leads to derepression of a potent preadipocyte enhancer and a doubling of IRX3 and IRX5 expression during early adipocyte differentiation. This results in a cell-autonomous developmental shift from energy-dissipating beige (brite) adipocytes to energy-storing white adipocytes, with a reduction in mitochondrial thermogenesis by a factor of 5, as well as an increase in lipid storage. Inhibition of Irx3 in adipose tissue in mice reduced body weight and increased energy dissipation without a change in physical activity or appetite. Knockdown of IRX3 or IRX5 in primary adipocytes from participants with the risk allele restored thermogenesis, increasing it by a factor of 7, and overexpression of these genes had the opposite effect in adipocytes from nonrisk-allele carriers. Repair of the ARID5B motif by CRISPR-Cas9 editing of rs1421085 in primary adipocytes from a patient with the risk allele restored IRX3 and IRX5 repression, activated browning expression programs, and restored thermogenesis, increasing it by a factor of 7.	Our results point to a pathway for adipocyte thermogenesis regulation involving ARID5B, rs1421085, IRX3, and IRX5, which, when manipulated, had pronounced pro-obesity and anti-obesity effects.

26286746	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression through partial complementary base-pairing to the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of target mRNAs. Inhibition of translation initiation has been identified as an early event of miRNA-mediated gene repression, but the underlying mechanistic details of this process are not well understood. Recently, eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4AII was identified as a critical modulator of miRNA activity with depletion of this factor alleviating miRNA-mediated gene repression. Using the CRISPR/Cas9-editing system, we generated a novel cell line in which expression of eIF4AII was eliminated. The absence of eIF4AII does not affect cell viability, proliferation, or global mRNA translation. Importantly, we show that eIF4AII is dispensable for miRNA-mediated gene silencing.

26278489	In recent years, several new genome editing technologies have been developed. Of these the zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and the CRISPR/Cas9 RNA-guided endonuclease system are the most widely described. Each of these technologies utilizes restriction enzymes to introduce a DNA double stranded break at a targeted location with the guide of homologous binding proteins or RNA. Such targeting is viewed as a significant advancement compared to current gene therapy methods that lack such specificity. Proof-of-concept studies have been performed to treat multiple disorders, including in vivo experiments in mammals and even early phase human trials. Careful consideration and investigation of delivery strategies will be required so that the therapeutic potential for gene editing is achieved. In this review, the mechanisms of each of these gene editing technologies and evidence of therapeutic potential will be briefly described and a comprehensive list of past studies will be provided. The pharmaceutical approaches of each of these technologies are discussed along with the current delivery obstacles. The topics and information reviewed herein provide an outline of the groundbreaking research that is being performed, but also highlights the potential for progress yet to be made using these gene editing technologies.

26277216	Gene-targeted knockout technologies are invaluable tools for understanding the functions of genes in vivo. CRISPR/Cas9 system of RNA-guided genome editing is revolutionizing genetics research in a wide spectrum of organisms. Here, we combined CRISPR with in vivo electroporation in the chicken embryo to efficiently target the transcription factor PAX7 in tissues of the developing embryo. This approach generated mosaic genetic mutations within a wild-type cellular background. This series of proof-of-principle experiments indicate that in vivo CRISPR-mediated cell genome engineering is an effective method to achieve gene loss-of-function in the tissues of the chicken embryo and it completes the growing genetic toolbox to study the molecular mechanisms regulating development in this important animal model.

26276636	CTCF and the associated cohesin complex play a central role in insulator function and higher-order chromatin organization of mammalian genomes. Recent studies identified a correlation between the orientation of CTCF-binding sites (CBSs) and chromatin loops. To test the functional significance of this observation, we combined CRISPR/Cas9-based genomic-DNA-fragment editing with chromosome-conformation-capture experiments to show that the location and relative orientations of CBSs determine the specificity of long-range chromatin looping in mammalian genomes, using protocadherin (Pcdh) and β-globin as model genes. Inversion of CBS elements within the Pcdh enhancer reconfigures the topology of chromatin loops between the distal enhancer and target promoters and alters gene-expression patterns. Thus, although enhancers can function in an orientation-independent manner in reporter assays, in the native chromosome context, the orientation of at least some enhancers carrying CBSs can determine both the architecture of topological chromatin domains and enhancer/promoter specificity. These findings reveal how 3D chromosome architecture can be encoded by linear genome sequences.

26275230	Members of genus Bifidobacterium are Gram-positive bacteria, representing a large part of the human infant microbiota and moderately common in adults. However, our knowledge about their diversity, intraspecific phylogeny and long-term persistence in humans is still limited. Bifidobacterium longum is generally considered to be the most common and prevalent species in the intestinal microbiota. In this work we studied whole genome sequences of 28 strains of B. longum, including 8 sequences described in this paper. Part of these strains were isolated from healthy children during a long observation period (up to 10 years between isolation from the same patient). The three known subspecies (longum, infantis and suis) could be clearly divided using sequence-based phylogenetic methods, gene content and the average nucleotide identity. The profiles of glycoside hydrolase genes reflected the different ecological specializations of these three subspecies. The high impact of horizontal gene transfer on genomic diversity was observed, which is possibly due to a large number of prophages and rapidly spreading plasmids. The pan-genome characteristics of the subspecies longum corresponded to the open pan-genome model. While the major part of the strain-specific genetic loci represented transposons and phage-derived regions, a large number of cell envelope synthesis genes were also observed within this category, representing high variability of cell surface molecules. We observed the cases of isolation of high genetically similar strains of B. longum from the same patients after long periods of time, however, we didn't succeed in the isolation of genetically identical bacteria: a fact, reflecting the high plasticity of microbiota in children.

26269544	Targeted mutagenesis, editing of endogenous maize (Zea mays) genes, and site-specific insertion of a trait gene using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated (Cas)-guide RNA technology are reported in maize. DNA vectors expressing maize codon-optimized Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 endonuclease and single guide RNAs were cointroduced with or without DNA repair templates into maize immature embryos by biolistic transformation targeting five different genomic regions: upstream of the liguleless1 (LIG1) gene, male fertility genes (Ms26 and Ms45), and acetolactate synthase (ALS) genes (ALS1 and ALS2). Mutations were subsequently identified at all sites targeted, and plants containing biallelic multiplex mutations at LIG1, Ms26, and Ms45 were recovered. Biolistic delivery of guide RNAs (as RNA molecules) directly into immature embryo cells containing preintegrated Cas9 also resulted in targeted mutations. Editing the ALS2 gene using either single-stranded oligonucleotides or double-stranded DNA vectors as repair templates yielded chlorsulfuron-resistant plants. Double-strand breaks generated by RNA-guided Cas9 endonuclease also stimulated insertion of a trait gene at a site near LIG1 by homology-directed repair. Progeny showed expected Mendelian segregation of mutations, edits, and targeted gene insertions. The examples reported in this study demonstrate the utility of Cas9-guide RNA technology as a plant genome editing tool to enhance plant breeding and crop research needed to meet growing agriculture demands of the future.

26268927	Xenopus tropicalis is an emerging vertebrate genetic model. A gene knock-in method has not yet been reported in this species. Here, we report that heritable targeted integration can be achieved in this diploid frog using a concurrent cleavage strategy mediated by the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) system. The key point of the strategy is the addition of a Cas9/guide RNA cleavage site in the donor vector, allowing simultaneous cutting of the chromosomal target site and circular donor DNA in vivo. For the 3 distinct loci tested, all showed efficient targeted integration that was verified by both germ-line transmission and Southern blot analyses. By designing the target sites in introns, we were able to get precise editing of the tyrosinase coding sequence and green fluorescent protein expression from endogenous n-tubulin promoter and enhancers. We were unable to detect off-target effects with the T7 endonuclease I assay. Precise editing of protein coding sequences in X. tropicalis expands the utility of this diploid frog, such as for establishing models to study human inherited diseases.

26264708	Polarized airway epithelial cell cultures modelling Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR) defect are crucial for CF and biomedical research. RNA interference has proven its value to generate knockdown models for various pathologies. More recently, genome editing using CRISPR-Cas9 artificial endonuclease was a valuable addition to the toolbox of gene inactivation.	Calu-3 cells and primary HAECs were transduced with HIV-1-derived lentiviral vectors (LVV) encoding small hairpin RNA (shRNA) sequence or CRISPR-Cas9 components targeting CFTR alongside GFP. After sorting of GFP-positive cells, CFTR expression was measured by RT-qPCR and Western blot in polarized or differentiated cells. CFTR channel function was assessed in Ussing chambers. Il-8 secretion, proliferation and cell migration were also studied in transduced cells.	shRNA interference and CRISPRCas9 strategies efficiently decreased CFTR expression in Calu-3 cells. Strong CFTR knockdown was confirmed at the functional level in CRISPR-Cas9-modified cells. CFTR-specific shRNA sequences did not reduce gene expression in primary HAECs, whereas CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene modification activity was correlated with a reduction of transepithelial secretion and response to a CFTR inhibitor. CFTR inactivation in the CRISPR-Cas9-modified Calu-3 cells did not affect migration and proliferation but slightly increased basal interleukin-8 secretion.	We generated CFTR inactivated cell lines and demonstrated that CRISPR-Cas9 vectorised in a single LVV efficiently promotes CFTR inactivation in primary HAECs. These results provide a new protocol to engineer CF primary epithelia with their isogenic controls and pave the way for manipulation of CFTR expression in these cultures.

26260320	The adeno-associated virus site 1 (AAVS1) locus in the human genome is a strong candidate for gene therapy by insertion of an exogenous gene into the locus. The AAVS1 locus includes the coding region for myosin binding subunit 85 (MBS85). Although the function of MBS85 is not well understood, myosin II-dependent contractile force may be affected by altered expression of MBS85. The effect of altered expression of MBS85 on cellular contractile force should be examined prior to the application of gene therapy. In this study, we show that transgene integration into AAVS1 and consequent reduction of MBS85 expression changes myosin II-dependent cellular contractile force. We established a human fibroblast cell line with exogenous DNA knocked-in to AAVS1 (KI cells) using the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system. Western blotting analysis showed that KI cells had significantly reduced MBS85 expression. KI cells also showed greater cellular contractile force than control cells. The increased contractile force was associated with phosphorylation of the myosin II regulatory light chain (MRLC). Transfection of KI cells with an MBS85 expression plasmid restored cellular contractile force and phosphorylation of MRLC to the levels in control cells. These data suggest that transgene integration into the human AAVS1 locus induces an increase in cellular contractile force and thus should be considered as a gene therapy to effect changes in cellular contractile force.

26246379	Ex vivo expansion of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) would benefit clinical applications in several aspects, to improve patient survival, utilize cord blood stem cells for adult applications, and selectively propagate stem cell populations after genetic manipulation. In this review we summarize and discuss recent advances in the culture systems of mouse and human HSCs, which include stroma/HSC co-culture, continuous perfusion and fed-batch cultures, and those supplemented with extrinsic ligands, membrane transportable transcription factors, complement components, protein modification enzymes, metabolites, or small molecule chemicals. Some of the expansion systems have been tested in clinical trials. The optimal condition for ex vivo expansion of the primitive and functional human HSCs is still under development. An improved understanding of the mechanisms for HSC cell fate determination and the HSC culture characteristics will guide development of new strategies to overcome difficulties. In the future, development of a combination treatment regimen with agents that enhance self-renewal, block differentiation, and improve homing will be critical. Methods to enhance yields and lower cost during collection and processing should be employed. The employment of an efficient system for ex vivo expansion of HSCs will facilitate the further development of novel strategies for cell and gene therapies including genome editing.	J Xie|C Zhang
26243775	In bacteria and archaea, short fragments of foreign DNA are integrated into Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeat (CRISPR) loci, providing a molecular memory of previous encounters with foreign genetic elements. In Escherichia coli, short CRISPR-derived RNAs are incorporated into a multi-subunit surveillance complex called Cascade (CRISPR-associated complex for antiviral defense). Recent structures of Cascade capture snapshots of this seahorse-shaped RNA-guided surveillance complex before and after binding to a DNA target. Here we determine a 3.2 Å x-ray crystal structure of Cascade in a new crystal form that provides insight into the mechanism of double-stranded DNA binding. Molecular dynamic simulations performed using available structures reveal functional roles for residues in the tail, backbone and belly subunits of Cascade that are critical for binding double-stranded DNA. Structural comparisons are used to make functional predictions and these predictions are tested in vivo and in vitro. Collectively, the results in this study reveal underlying mechanisms involved in target-induced conformational changes and highlight residues important in DNA binding and protospacer adjacent motif recognition.

26242611	Knockdown mouse models, where gene dosages can be modulated, provide valuable insights into gene function. Typically, such models are generated by embryonic stem (ES) cell-based targeted insertion, or pronuclear injection, of the knockdown expression cassette. However, these methods are associated with laborious and time-consuming steps, such as the generation of large constructs with elements needed for expression of a functional RNAi-cassette, ES-cell handling, or screening for mice with the desired knockdown effect. Here, we demonstrate that reliable knockdown models can be generated by targeted insertion of artificial microRNA (amiRNA) sequences into a specific locus in the genome [such as intronic regions of endogenous eukaryotic translation elongation factor 2 (eEF-2) gene] using the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats/Crispr associated 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) system. We used in vitro synthesized single-stranded DNAs (about 0.5-kb long) that code for amiRNA sequences as repair templates in CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis. Using this approach we demonstrate that amiRNA cassettes against exogenous (eGFP) or endogenous [orthodenticle homeobox 2 (Otx2)] genes can be efficiently targeted to a predetermined locus in the genome and result in knockdown of gene expression. We also provide a strategy to establish conditional knockdown models with this method.	H Miura|CB Gurumurthy|T Sato|M Sato|M Ohtsuka
26241388	Fused lobes (FDL) is an enzyme that simultaneously catalyzes a key trimming reaction and antagonizes elongation reactions in the insect N-glycan processing pathway. Accordingly, FDL function accounts, at least in part, for major differences in the N-glycosylation patterns of glycoproteins produced by insect and mammalian cells. In this study, we used the CRISPR-Cas9 system to edit the fdl gene in Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells. CRISPR-Cas9 editing produced a high frequency of site-specific nucleotide insertions and deletions, reduced the production of insect-type, paucimannosidic products (Man3GlcNAc2), and led to the production of partially elongated, mammalian-type complex N-glycans (GlcNAc2Man3GlcNAc2) in S2 cells. As CRISPR-Cas9 has not been widely used to analyze or modify protein glycosylation pathways or edit insect cell genes, these results underscore its broad utility as a tool for these purposes. Our results also confirm the key role of FDL at the major branch point distinguishing insect and mammalian N-glycan processing pathways. Finally, the new FDL-deficient S2 cell derivative produced in this study will enable future bottom-up glycoengineering efforts designed to isolate insect cell lines that can efficiently produce recombinant glycoproteins with chemically predefined oligosaccharide side-chain structures.

26240362	Infertility is a prevalent health issue, affecting ∼15% of couples of childbearing age. Nearly one-half of idiopathic infertility cases are thought to have a genetic basis, but the underlying causes are largely unknown. Traditional methods for studying inheritance, such as genome-wide association studies and linkage analyses, have been confounded by the genetic and phenotypic complexity of reproductive processes. Here we describe an association- and linkage-free approach to identify segregating infertility alleles, in which CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing is used to model putatively deleterious nonsynonymous SNPs (nsSNPs) in the mouse orthologs of fertility genes. Mice bearing "humanized" alleles of four essential meiosis genes, each predicted to be deleterious by most of the commonly used algorithms for analyzing functional SNP consequences, were examined for fertility and reproductive defects. Only a Cdk2 allele mimicking SNP rs3087335, which alters an inhibitory WEE1 protein kinase phosphorylation site, caused infertility and revealed a novel function in regulating spermatogonial stem cell maintenance. Our data indicate that segregating infertility alleles exist in human populations. Furthermore, whereas computational prediction of SNP effects is useful for identifying candidate causal mutations for diverse diseases, this study underscores the need for in vivo functional evaluation of physiological consequences. This approach can revolutionize personalized reproductive genetics by establishing a permanent reference of benign vs. infertile alleles.	P Singh|JC Schimenti
26238567	In recent years the emergence of multidrug resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae strains has been an increasingly common event. This opportunistic species is one of the five main bacterial pathogens that cause hospital infections worldwide and multidrug resistance has been associated with the presence of high molecular weight plasmids. Plasmids are generally acquired through horizontal transfer and therefore is possible that systems that prevent the entry of foreign genetic material are inactive or absent. One of these systems is CRISPR/Cas. However, little is known regarding the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and their associated Cas proteins (CRISPR/Cas) system in K. pneumoniae. The adaptive immune system CRISPR/Cas has been shown to limit the entry of foreign genetic elements into bacterial organisms and in some bacteria it has been shown to be involved in regulation of virulence genes. Thus in this work we used bioinformatics tools to determine the presence or absence of CRISPR/Cas systems in available K. pneumoniae genomes.	The complete CRISPR/Cas system was identified in two out of the eight complete K. pneumoniae genomes sequences and in four out of the 44 available draft genomes sequences. The cas genes in these strains comprises eight cas genes similar to those found in Escherichia coli, suggesting they belong to the type I-E group, although their arrangement is slightly different. As for the CRISPR sequences, the average lengths of the direct repeats and spacers were 29 and 33 bp, respectively. BLAST searches demonstrated that 38 of the 116 spacer sequences (33%) are significantly similar to either plasmid, phage or genome sequences, while the remaining 78 sequences (67%) showed no significant similarity to other sequences. The region where the CRISPR/Cas systems were located is the same in all the Klebsiella genomes containing it, it has a syntenic architecture, and is located among genes encoding for proteins likely involved in metabolism and resistance to antibiotics.	The CRISPR/Cas system is not widely distributed in K. pneumoniae genomes, those present most likely belong to type I-E with few differences from the arrangement of the cse3 gene and most of the spacers have not been are not described yet. Given that the CRISPR/Cas system is scarcely distributed among K. pneumoniae genomes it is not clear whether it is involved in either immunity against foreign genetic material or virulence. We consider that this study represents a first step to understand the role of CRISPR/Cas in K. pneumoniae.	ML Ostria-Hernández|CJ Sánchez-Vallejo|JA Ibarra|G Castro-Escarpulli
26230606	CRISPR-Cas systems constitute adaptive immune systems for antiviral defense in bacteria. We investigated the occurrence and diversity of CRISPR-Cas systems in 48 Bifidobacterium genomes to gain insights into the diversity and co-evolution of CRISPR-Cas systems within the genus and investigate CRISPR spacer content. We identified the elements necessary for the successful targeting and inference of foreign DNA in select Type II CRISPR-Cas systems, including the tracrRNA and target PAM sequence. Bifidobacterium species have a very high frequency of CRISPR-Cas occurrence (77%, 37 of 48). We found that many Bifidobacterium species have unusually large and diverse CRISPR-Cas systems that contain spacer sequences showing homology to foreign genetic elements like prophages. A large number of CRISPR spacers in bifidobacteria show perfect homology to prophage sequences harbored in the chromosomes of other species of Bifidobacterium, including some spacers that self-target the chromosome. A correlation was observed between strains that lacked CRISPR-Cas systems and the number of times prophages in that chromosome were targeted by other CRISPR spacers. The presence of prophage-targeting CRISPR spacers and prophage content may shed light on evolutionary processes and strain divergence. Finally, elements of Type II CRISPR-Cas systems, including the tracrRNA and crRNAs, set the stage for the development of genome editing and genetic engineering tools.

26216948	T-cell genome engineering holds great promise for cell-based therapies for cancer, HIV, primary immune deficiencies, and autoimmune diseases, but genetic manipulation of human T cells has been challenging. Improved tools are needed to efficiently "knock out" genes and "knock in" targeted genome modifications to modulate T-cell function and correct disease-associated mutations. CRISPR/Cas9 technology is facilitating genome engineering in many cell types, but in human T cells its efficiency has been limited and it has not yet proven useful for targeted nucleotide replacements. Here we report efficient genome engineering in human CD4(+) T cells using Cas9:single-guide RNA ribonucleoproteins (Cas9 RNPs). Cas9 RNPs allowed ablation of CXCR4, a coreceptor for HIV entry. Cas9 RNP electroporation caused up to ∼40% of cells to lose high-level cell-surface expression of CXCR4, and edited cells could be enriched by sorting based on low CXCR4 expression. Importantly, Cas9 RNPs paired with homology-directed repair template oligonucleotides generated a high frequency of targeted genome modifications in primary T cells. Targeted nucleotide replacement was achieved in CXCR4 and PD-1 (PDCD1), a regulator of T-cell exhaustion that is a validated target for tumor immunotherapy. Deep sequencing of a target site confirmed that Cas9 RNPs generated knock-in genome modifications with up to ∼20% efficiency, which accounted for up to approximately one-third of total editing events. These results establish Cas9 RNP technology for diverse experimental and therapeutic genome engineering applications in primary human T cells.

26211322	To detect clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) in Shigella, and to analyze its relationship to drug resistance.	Four pairs of primers were used for the detection of convincing CRISPR structures CRISPR-S2 and CRISPR-S4, questionable CRISPR structures CRISPR-S1 and CRISPR-S3 in 60 Shigella strains. All primers were designed using sequences in CRISPR database. CRISPR Finder was used to analyze CRISPR and susceptibilities of Shigella strains were tested by agar diffusion method. Furthermore, we analyzed the relationship between drug resistance and CRISPR-S4.	The positive rate of convincing CRISPR structures was 95%. The four CRISPR loci formed 12 spectral patterns (A-L), all of which contained convincing CRISPR structures except type K. We found one new repeat and 12 new spacers. The multi-drug resistance rate was 53. 33% . We found no significant difference between CRISPR-S4 and drug resistant. However, the repeat sequence of CRISPR-S4 in multi- or TE-resistance strains was mainly R4.1 with AC deletions in the 3' end, and the spacer sequences of CRISPR-S4 in multi-drug resistance strains were mainly Sp5.1, Sp6.1 and Sp7.	CRISPR was common in Shigella. Variations df repeat sequences and diversities of spacer sequences might be related to drug resistance in Shigella.	L Wang|Y Wang|G Duan|Z Xue|X Guo|P Wang|Y Xi|H Yang
26211252	This study was aimed to explore the features of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) structures in Shigella by using bioinformatics. We used bioinformatics methods, including BLAST, alignment and RNA structure prediction, to analyze the CRISPR structures of Shigella genomes. The results showed that the CRISPRs existed in the four groups of Shigella, and the flanking sequences of upstream CRISPRs could be classified into the same group with those of the downstream. We also found some relatively conserved palindromic motifs in the leader sequences. Repeat sequences had the same group with corresponding flanking sequences, and could be classified into two different types by their RNA secondary structures, which contain "stem" and "ring". Some spacers were found to homologize with part sequences of plasmids or phages. The study indicated that there were correlations between repeat sequences and flanking sequences, and the repeats might act as a kind of recognition mechanism to mediate the interaction between foreign genetic elements and Cas proteins.

26209430	The CRISPR/Cas9 system was recently developed as a powerful and flexible technology for targeted genome engineering, including genome editing (altering the genetic sequence) and gene regulation (without altering the genetic sequence). These applications require the design of single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) that are efficient and specific. However, this remains challenging, as it requires the consideration of many criteria. Several sgRNA design tools have been developed for gene editing, but currently there is no tool for the design of sgRNAs for gene regulation. With accumulating experimental data on the use of CRISPR/Cas9 for gene editing and regulation, we implement a comprehensive computational tool based on a set of sgRNA design rules summarized from these published reports.

26203860	Human pluripotent stem cells provide a versatile platform for regenerative studies, drug testing and disease modeling. That the expression of only four transcription factors, Oct4, Klf4, Sox2 and c-Myc (OKSM), is sufficient for generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from differentiated somatic cells has revolutionized the field and also highlighted the importance of OKSM as targets for genome editing. A number of novel genome-editing systems have been developed recently. In this review, we focus on successful applications of several such systems for generation of iPSCs. In particular, we discuss genome-editing systems based on zinc-finger fusion proteins (ZFs), transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) and an RNA-guided DNA-specific nuclease, Cas9, derived from the bacterial defense system against viruses that utilizes clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR).

26189575	The RNA Polymerase II C-terminal domain (CTD) kinase CDK12 has been implicated as a tumor suppressor and regulator of DNA damage response genes. Although much has been learned about CDK12 and its activity, due to the lack of a specific inhibitor and the complications posed by long term RNAi depletion, much is still unknown about the particulars of CDK12 function. Therefore gaining a better understanding of CDK12's roles at the molecular level will be challenging without the development of additional tools. In order to address these issues we have used the CRISPR/Cas gene engineering system to create a mammalian cell line in which the only functional copy of CDK12 is selectively inhibitable by a cell-permeable adenine analog (analog-sensitive CDK12). Inhibition of CDK12 results in a perturbation of the phosphorylation patterns on the CTD and an arrest in cellular proliferation. This cell line should serve as a powerful tool for future studies.

26188514	Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is a common pathogen that can cause serious infections, even death. Because of the horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of antibiotic resistance genes, the drug resistant condition is becoming increasingly prevalent. Recently, an adaptive immunity system, named clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR), was discovered and demonstrated to confer a defense against foreign invading elements that may carry the antibiotic resistance genes. In this study, we reveal the features of 45 identified CRISPR loci and the CRISPR associated gene (Cas) in 32 S. aureus strains from CRISPR database. Five spacers of S. aureus 08BA02176 and MSHR1132 were homologous with foreign genetic sequences from phages or plasmids, even containing a spacer sequence identical to part of some phages' genomes containing lukPV gene that encodes the PVL toxin. Many S. aureus strains with the same CRISPR type shared the same MLST type. CRISPR loci that had 3 or more similar protein loci mostly belonged to the same CRISPR type. We came to the conclusion that the CRISPR/Cas of strains 08BA02176 and MSHR1132 were inherited from a common ancestor or recombined from Staphylococcus lugdunensis. CRISPR loci can be mobilized and can transfer among different but closely related species, and the same types of MLST strains exhibit a higher affinity to the same types of CRISPR loci. Bacteriophages may be the predominant challenge facing S. aureus. The CRISPR/Cas structure may limit the transmission of bacterial virulence among S. aureus.	S Yang|J Liu|F Shao|P Wang|G Duan|H Yang
26186289	In a recent issue of Nature Methods, Shechner et al. (2015) reported the development of CRISPR Display (CRISP-Disp), which is a sophisticated, flexible, modular, and multiplexable platform for targeting different types of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) to genomic loci. CRISP-Disp will facilitate synthetic-biology applications and enable the elucidation of ncRNA functions.	P Perez-Pinera|MF Jones|A Lal|TK Lu
26182359	CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat) systems provide bacteria and archaea with adaptive immunity to repel invasive genetic elements. Type I systems use 'cascade' [CRISPR-associated (Cas) complex for antiviral defence] ribonucleoprotein complexes to target invader DNA, by base pairing CRISPR RNA (crRNA) to protospacers. Cascade identifies PAMs (protospacer adjacent motifs) on invader DNA, triggering R-loop formation and subsequent DNA degradation by Cas3. Cas8 is a candidate PAM recognition factor in some cascades. We analysed Cas8 homologues from type IB CRISPR systems in archaea Haloferax volcanii (Hvo) and Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus (Mth). Cas8 was essential for CRISPR interference in Hvo and purified Mth Cas8 protein responded to PAM sequence when binding to nucleic acids. Cas8 interacted physically with Cas5-Cas7-crRNA complex, stimulating binding to PAM containing substrates. Mutation of conserved Cas8 amino acid residues abolished interference in vivo and altered catalytic activity of Cas8 protein in vitro. This is experimental evidence that Cas8 is important for targeting Cascade to invader DNA.	SD Cass|KA Haas|B Stoll|OS Alkhnbashi|K Sharma|H Urlaub|R Backofen|A Marchfelder|EL Bolt
26178787	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a genomically diverse, prevalent, and almost invariably fatal malignancy. Although conventional genetically engineered mouse models of human PDAC have been instrumental in understanding pancreatic cancer development, these models are much too labor-intensive, expensive, and slow to perform the extensive molecular analyses needed to adequately understand this disease. Here we demonstrate that retrograde pancreatic ductal injection of either adenoviral-Cre or lentiviral-Cre vectors allows titratable initiation of pancreatic neoplasias that progress into invasive and metastatic PDAC. To enable in vivo CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene inactivation in the pancreas, we generated a Cre-regulated Cas9 allele and lentiviral vectors that express Cre and a single-guide RNA. CRISPR-mediated targeting of Lkb1 in combination with oncogenic Kras expression led to selection for inactivating genomic alterations, absence of Lkb1 protein, and rapid tumor growth that phenocopied Cre-mediated genetic deletion of Lkb1. This method will transform our ability to rapidly interrogate gene function during the development of this recalcitrant cancer.

26177297	Botulinum neurotoxins produced by Clostridium botulinum cause flaccid paralysis by inhibiting neurotransmitter release at peripheral nerve terminals. Previously, we found that neurons derived from the murine P19 embryonal carcinoma cell line exhibited high sensitivity to botulinum neurotoxin type C. In order to prove the utility of P19 cells for the study of the intracellular mechanism of botulinum neurotoxins, ganglioside-knockout neurons were generated by deletion of the gene encoding beta-1,4 N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 1 in P19 cells using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats combined with Cas9 (CRISPR/Cas9) system. By using this system, knockout cells could be generated more easily than with previous methods. The sensitivity of the generated beta-1,4 N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 1-depleted P19 neurons to botulinum neurotoxin type C was decreased considerably, and the exogenous addition of the gangliosides GD1a, GD1b, and GT1b restored the susceptibility of P19 cells to botulinum neurotoxin type C. In particular, addition of a mixture of these three ganglioside more effectively recovered the sensitivity of knockout cells compared to independent addition of GD1a, GD1b, or GT1b. Consequently, the genome-edited P19 cells generated by the CRISPR/Cas9 system were useful for identifying and defining the intracellular molecules involved in the toxic action of botulinum neurotoxins.

26175431	The ability to rapidly and specifically modify the genome of mammalian cells has been a long-term goal of biomedical researchers. Recently, the clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 system from bacteria has been exploited for genome engineering in human cells. The CRISPR system directs the RNA-guided Cas9 nuclease to a specific genomic locus to induce a DNA double-strand break that may be subsequently repaired by homology-directed repair using an exogenous DNA repair template. Here we describe a protocol using CRISPR/Cas9 to achieve bi-allelic insertion of a point mutation in human cells. Using this method, homozygous clonal cell lines can be constructed in 5-6 weeks. This method can also be adapted to insert larger DNA elements, such as fluorescent proteins and degrons, at defined genomic locations. CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering offers exciting applications in both basic science and translational research.	TC Moyer|AJ Holland
26167643	We developed an in vivo library-on-library methodology to simultaneously assess single guide RNA (sgRNA) activity across ∼1,400 genomic loci. Assaying across multiple human cell types and end-processing enzymes as well as two Cas9 orthologs, we unraveled underlying nucleotide sequence and epigenetic parameters. Our results and software (http://crispr.med.harvard.edu/sgRNAScorer) enable improved design of reagents, shed light on mechanisms of genome targeting, and provide a generalizable framework to study nucleic acid-nucleic acid interactions and biochemistry in high throughput.

26165496	The simplicity of the CRISPR/Cas9 system of genome engineering has opened up the possibility of performing genome-wide targeted mutagenesis in cell lines, enabling screening for cellular phenotypes resulting from genetic aberrations. Drosophila cells have proven to be highly effective in identifying genes involved in cellular processes through similar screens using partial knockdown by RNAi. This is in part due to the lower degree of redundancy between genes in this organism, whilst still maintaining highly conserved gene networks and orthologs of many human disease-causing genes. The ability of CRISPR to generate genetic loss of function mutations not only increases the magnitude of any effect over currently employed RNAi techniques, but allows analysis over longer periods of time which can be critical for certain phenotypes. In this study, we have designed and built a genome-wide CRISPR library covering 13,501 genes, among which 8989 genes are targeted by three or more independent single guide RNAs (sgRNAs). Moreover, we describe strategies to monitor the population of guide RNAs by high throughput sequencing (HTS). We hope that this library will provide an invaluable resource for the community to screen loss of function mutations for cellular phenotypes, and as a source of guide RNA designs for future studies.

26160901	Gene-editing techniques are revolutionizing the way we conduct genetics in many organisms. The CRISPR/Cas nuclease has emerged as a highly versatile, efficient and affordable tool for targeting chosen sites in the genome. Beyond its applications in established model organisms, CRISPR technology provides a platform for genetic intervention in a wide range of species, limited only by our ability to deliver it to cells and to select mutations efficiently. Here, we test the CRISPR technology in an emerging insect model and pest, the beetle Tribolium castaneum. We use simple assays to test CRISPR/Cas activity, we demonstrate efficient expression of guide RNAs and Cas9 from Tribolium U6 and hsp68 promoters and we test the efficiency of knockout and knock-in approaches in Tribolium. We find that 55-80% of injected individuals carry mutations (indels) generated by non-homologous end joining, including mosaic bi-allelic knockouts; 71-100% carry such mutations in their germ line and transmit them to the next generation. We show that CRISPR-mediated gene knockout of the Tribolium E-cadherin gene causes defects in dorsal closure, which is consistent with RNAi-induced phenotypes. Homology-directed knock-in of marker transgenes was observed in 14% of injected individuals and transmitted to the next generation by 6% of injected individuals. Previous work in Tribolium mapped a large number of transgene insertions associated with developmental phenotypes and enhancer traps. We present an efficient method for re-purposing these insertions, via CRISPR-mediated replacement of these transgenes by new constructs.	AF Gilles|JB Schinko|M Averof
26156133	The recent development of designer nucleases allows for the efficient and precise introduction of genetic change into livestock genomes. Most studies so far have focused on the introduction of random mutations in cultured cells and the use of nuclear transfer to generate animals with edited genotypes. To circumvent the intrinsic uncertainties of random mutations and the inefficiencies of nuclear transfer we directed our efforts to the introduction of specific genetic changes by homology-driven repair directly in in vitro produced embryos. Initially, we injected zinc finger nuclease (ZFN)-encoding mRNA or DNA into bovine zygotes to verify cleavage activity at their target site within the gene for beta-lactoglobulin (LGB) and detected ZFN-induced random mutations in 30% to 80% of embryos. Next, to precisely change the LGB sequence, we co-injected ZFNs or transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) with DNA oligonucleotides (ODNs). Analysis of co-injected embryos showed targeted changes in up to 33% (ZFNs) and 46% (TALENs) of blastocysts. Deep sequence analysis of selected embryos revealed contributions of the targeted LGB allele can reach 100% which implies that genome editing by zygote injections can facilitate the one-step generation of non-mosaic livestock animals with pre-designed biallelic modifications.

26150355	Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) is a secreted glycoprotein with a major role in shaping the extracellular matrix and a detailed understanding of the secretory mechanism could help identify methods to correct diseases resulting from dysregulation of secretion. MMP-9 appears to follow a canonical secretory pathway through a quality control cycle in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) before transport of the properly folded protein to the Golgi apparatus and beyond for secretion. Through a complementation assay, we determined that LMAN1, a well-studied lectin-carrier protein, interacts with a secretion-competent N-glycosylated MMP-9 in the ER while N-glycosylation-deficient secretion-compromised MMP-9 does not. In contrast, co-immunoprecipitation demonstrated protein interaction between LMAN1 and secretion-compromised N-glycosylation-deficient MMP-9. MMP-9 secretion was reduced in the LMAN1 knockout cell line compared to control cells confirming the functional role of LMAN1. These observations support the role of LMAN1 as a lectin-carrier protein mediating efficient MMP-9 secretion.	T Duellman|J Burnett|A Shin|J Yang
26148499	One of the bottlenecks in production of biochemicals and pharmaceuticals in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is stable and homogeneous expression of pathway genes. Integration of genes into the genome of the production organism is often a preferred option when compared to expression from episomal vectors. Existing approaches for achieving stable simultaneous genome integrations of multiple DNA fragments often result in relatively low integration efficiencies and furthermore rely on the use of selection markers.	Here, we have developed a novel method, CrEdit (CRISPR/Cas9 mediated genome Editing), which utilizes targeted double strand breaks caused by CRISPR/Cas9 to significantly increase the efficiency of homologous integration in order to edit and manipulate genomic DNA. Using CrEdit, the efficiency and locus specificity of targeted genome integrations reach close to 100% for single gene integration using short homology arms down to 60 base pairs both with and without selection. This enables direct and cost efficient inclusion of homology arms in PCR primers. As a proof of concept, a non-native β-carotene pathway was reconstructed in S. cerevisiae by simultaneous integration of three pathway genes into individual intergenic genomic sites. Using longer homology arms, we demonstrate highly efficient and locus-specific genome integration even without selection with up to 84% correct clones for simultaneous integration of three gene expression cassettes.	The CrEdit approach enables fast and cost effective genome integration for engineering of S. cerevisiae. Since the choice of the targeting sites is flexible, CrEdit is a powerful tool for diverse genome engineering applications.

26147622	African Americans have a disproportionate risk for developing nephropathy. This disparity has been attributed to coding variants (G1 and G2) in apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1); however, there is little functional evidence supporting the role of this protein in renal function. Here, we combined genetics and in vivo modeling to examine the role of apol1 in glomerular development and pronephric filtration and to test the pathogenic potential of APOL1 G1 and G2. Translational suppression or CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing of apol1 in zebrafish embryos results in podocyte loss and glomerular filtration defects. Complementation of apol1 morphants with wild-type human APOL1 mRNA rescues these defects. However, the APOL1 G1 risk allele does not ameliorate defects caused by apol1 suppression and the pathogenicity is conferred by the cis effect of both individual variants of the G1 risk haplotype (I384M/S342G). In vivo complementation studies of the G2 risk allele also indicate that the variant is deleterious to protein function. Moreover, APOL1 G2, but not G1, expression alone promotes developmental kidney defects, suggesting a possible dominant-negative effect of the altered protein. In sickle cell disease (SCD) patients, we reported previously a genetic interaction between APOL1 and MYH9. Testing this interaction in vivo by co-suppressing both transcripts yielded no additive effects. However, upon genetic or chemical induction of anemia, we observed a significantly exacerbated nephropathy phenotype. Furthermore, concordant with the genetic interaction observed in SCD patients, APOL1 G2 reduces myh9 expression in vivo, suggesting a possible interaction between the altered APOL1 and myh9. Our data indicate a critical role for APOL1 in renal function that is compromised by nephropathy-risk encoding variants. Moreover, our interaction studies indicate that the MYH9 locus is also relevant to the phenotype in a stressed microenvironment and suggest that consideration of the context-dependent functions of both proteins will be required to develop therapeutic paradigms.

26147218	The European hazelnut (Corylus avellana) is threatened in Europe by several pseudomonads which cause symptoms ranging from twig dieback to tree death. A comparison of the draft genomes of nine Pseudomonas strains isolated from symptomatic C. avellana trees was performed to identify common and distinctive genomic traits. The thorough assessment of genetic relationships among the strains revealed two clearly distinct clusters: P. avellanae and P. syringae. The latter including the pathovars avellanae, coryli and syringae. Between these two clusters, no recombination event was found. A genomic island of approximately 20 kb, containing the hrp/hrc type III secretion system gene cluster, was found to be present without any genomic difference in all nine pseudomonads. The type III secretion system effector repertoires were remarkably different in the two groups, with P. avellanae showing a higher number of effectors. Homologue genes of the antimetabolite mangotoxin and ice nucleation activity clusters were found solely in all P. syringae pathovar strains, whereas the siderophore yersiniabactin was only present in P. avellanae. All nine strains have genes coding for pectic enzymes and sucrose metabolism. By contrast, they do not have genes coding for indolacetic acid and anti-insect toxin. Collectively, this study reveals that genomically different Pseudomonas can converge on the same host plant by suppressing the host defence mechanisms with the use of different virulence weapons. The integration into their genomes of a horizontally acquired genomic island could play a fundamental role in their evolution, perhaps giving them the ability to exploit new ecological niches.

26141150	Engineering cellular metabolism for improved production of valuable chemicals requires extensive modulation of bacterial genome to explore complex genetic spaces. Here, we report the development of a CRISPR-Cas9 based method for iterative genome editing and metabolic engineering of Escherichia coli. This system enables us to introduce various types of genomic modifications with near 100% editing efficiency and to introduce three mutations simultaneously. We also found that cells with intact mismatch repair system had reduced chance to escape CRISPR mediated cleavage and yielded increased editing efficiency. To demonstrate its potential, we used our method to integrate the β-carotene synthetic pathway into the genome and to optimize the methylerythritol-phosphate (MEP) pathway and central metabolic pathways for β-carotene overproduction. We collectively tested 33 genomic modifications and constructed more than 100 genetic variants for combinatorially exploring the metabolic landscape. Our best producer contained15 targeted mutations and produced 2.0 g/L β-carotene in fed-batch fermentation.	Y Li|Z Lin|C Huang|Y Zhang|Z Wang|YJ Tang|T Chen|X Zhao
26138589	The CRISPR/Cas9 system has enabled the editing of mammalian genomes; however, its applicability and efficiency in the pig genome has not been studied in depth. The α-gal epitope synthesized by α-1,3-galactosyltransferase gene (GGTA1) is known as a xenoantigen obtained upon pig-to-human xenotransplantation. We here employed the CRISPR/Cas9 system-mediated knock-in of endogenous GGTA1 via targeted homologous recombination (HR). Linearized donors with ~800-bp homology flanking the CRISPR/Cas9 target site [exon 4 (containing ATG) of GGTA1] served as a template for gene targeting by HR. Using a targeted toxin strategy to select clones lacking α-gal epitope expression, we successfully obtained several knock-in clones within 3 weeks of initial transfection. These results suggest that the use of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated HR to knock-in a mutated fragment at defined loci represents an efficient strategy to achieve the rapid modulation of genes of interest in swine cells and is a promising tool for the creation of KO piglets.

26136211	Guide RNA molecules (crRNA) produced from clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) arrays, altogether with effector proteins (Cas) encoded by cognate cas (CRISPR associated) genes, mount an interference mechanism (CRISPR-Cas) that limits acquisition of foreign DNA in Bacteria and Archaea. The specificity of this action is provided by the repeat intervening spacer carried in the crRNA, which upon hybridization with complementary sequences enables their degradation by a Cas endonuclease. Moreover, CRISPR arrays are dynamic landscapes that may gain new spacers from infecting elements or lose them for example during genome replication. Thus, the spacer content of a strain determines the diversity of sequences that can be targeted by the corresponding CRISPR-Cas system reflecting its functionality. Most Escherichia coli strains possess either type I-E or I-F CRISPR-Cas systems. To evaluate their impact on the pathogenicity of the species, we inferred the pathotype and pathogenic potential of 126 strains of this and other closely related species and analyzed their repeat content. Our results revealed a negative correlation between the number of I-E CRISPR units in this system and the presence of pathogenicity traits: the median number of repeats was 2.5-fold higher for commensal isolates (with 29.5 units, range 0-53) than for pathogenic ones (12.0, range 0-42). Moreover, the higher the number of virulence factors within a strain, the lower the repeat content. Additionally, pathogenic strains of distinct ecological niches (i.e., intestinal or extraintestinal) differ in repeat counts. Altogether, these findings support an evolutionary connection between CRISPR and pathogenicity in E. coli.	E García-Gutiérrez|C Almendros|FJ Mojica|NM Guzmán|J García-Martínez
26134856	Frequency of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated targeted mutagenesis varies depending on Cas9 expression level and culture period of rice callus. Recent reports have demonstrated that the CRISPR/Cas9 system can function as a sequence-specific nuclease in various plant species. Induction of mutation in proliferating tissue during embryogenesis or in germline cells is a practical means of generating heritable mutations. In the case of plant species in which cultured cells are used for transformation, non-chimeric plants can be obtained when regeneration occurs from mutated cells. Since plantlets are regenerated from both mutated and non-mutated cells in a random manner, any increment in the proportion of mutated cells in Cas9- and guide RNA (gRNA)-expressing cells will help increase the number of plants containing heritable mutations. In this study, we examined factors affecting mutation frequency in rice calli. Following sequential transformation of rice calli with Cas9- and gRNA- expression constructs, the mutation frequency in independent Cas9 transgenic lines was analyzed. A positive correlation between Cas9 expression level and mutation frequency was found. This positive relationship was observed regardless of whether the transgene or an endogenous gene was used as the target for CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis. Furthermore, we found that extending the culture period increased the proportion of mutated cells as well as the variety of mutations obtained. Because mutated and non-mutated cells might proliferate equally, these results suggest that a prolonged tissue culture period increases the chance of inducing de novo mutations in non-mutated cells. This fundamental knowledge will help improve systems for obtaining non-chimeric regenerated plants in many plant species.	M Mikami|S Toki|M Endo
26134098	Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) represent an appealing cell source to develop disease-modeling assays, drug testing assays and cell-based replacement therapies especially for cardiac disorders.	The development of efficient protocols to generate pure populations of cardiac myocytes is a prerequisite to provide reproducible, robust and valid assays. Different techniques have been recently proposed that allow production of high-yield high-quality cardiomyocytes. In addition, the newly developed genome-editing techniques offer multiple opportunities to manipulate the genome of patient-specific iPSC thus generating syngeneic iPSC lines. Genome-editing techniques will also allow engineering of iPSC to make them suitable for replacement therapies.	Since their discovery, iPSCs have shown promise to revolutionize the way human diseases are studied. During the last years, different protocols have been developed to achieve reproducible and efficient differentiation of iPSCs including in cardiac and vascular cells. The recent introduction of the genome-editing techniques now allow targeted manipulation of the genome of patient-specific and control iPSCs lines. This approach would help to address a couple of current limitations, including the generation of isogenic lines for disease modeling and of clinical-grade lines for replacement therapy.

26122099	Human pluripotent stem cells represent a unique source for cell-based therapies and regenerative medicine. The intrinsic features of these cells such as their easy accessibility and their capacity to be expanded indefinitely overcome some limitations of conventional adult stem cells. Furthermore, the possibility to derive patient-specific induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells in combination with the current development of gene modification methods could be used for autologous cell therapies of some genetic diseases. In particular, muscular dystrophies are considered to be a good candidate due to the lack of efficacious therapeutic treatments for patients to date, and in view of the encouraging results arising from recent preclinical studies. Some hurdles, including possible genetic instability and their efficient differentiation into muscle progenitors through vector/transgene-free methods have still to be overcome or need further optimization. Additionally, engraftment and functional contribution to muscle regeneration in pre-clinical models need to be carefully assessed before clinical translation. This review offers a summary of the advanced methods recently developed to derive muscle progenitors from pluripotent stem cells, as well as gene therapy by gene addition and gene editing methods using ZFNs, TALENs or CRISPR/Cas9. We have also discussed the main issues that need to be addressed for successful clinical translation of genetically corrected patient-specific pluripotent stem cells in autologous transplantation trials for skeletal muscle disorders.

26121415	CRISPR-Cas-mediated genome editing relies on guide RNAs that direct site-specific DNA cleavage facilitated by the Cas endonuclease. Here we report that chemical alterations to synthesized single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) enhance genome editing efficiency in human primary T cells and CD34(+) hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Co-delivering chemically modified sgRNAs with Cas9 mRNA or protein is an efficient RNA- or ribonucleoprotein (RNP)-based delivery method for the CRISPR-Cas system, without the toxicity associated with DNA delivery. This approach is a simple and effective way to streamline the development of genome editing with the potential to accelerate a wide array of biotechnological and therapeutic applications of the CRISPR-Cas technology.

26113724	Bacterial adaptive immunity uses CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-associated (Cas) proteins together with CRISPR transcripts for foreign DNA degradation. In type II CRISPR-Cas systems, activation of Cas9 endonuclease for DNA recognition upon guide RNA binding occurs by an unknown mechanism. Crystal structures of Cas9 bound to single-guide RNA reveal a conformation distinct from both the apo and DNA-bound states, in which the 10-nucleotide RNA "seed" sequence required for initial DNA interrogation is preordered in an A-form conformation. This segment of the guide RNA is essential for Cas9 to form a DNA recognition-competent structure that is poised to engage double-stranded DNA target sequences. We construe this as convergent evolution of a "seed" mechanism reminiscent of that used by Argonaute proteins during RNA interference in eukaryotes.	F Jiang|K Zhou|L Ma|S Gressel|JA Doudna
26109795	Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major global health problem. Although current therapies, such as the use of nucleos(t)ide analogs, inhibit HBV replication efficiently, they do not eliminate covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), which persists in hepatocyte nuclei. As HBV cccDNA is a viral transcription template, novel therapeutic approaches to directly target HBV cccDNA are necessary to completely eradicate persistent HBV infections. HBV cccDNA levels in HBV-infected human liver cells are extremely low; thus, more reliable and simple measurement methods are needed to correctly monitor their levels during therapeutic treatment. Although reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction or Southern blot procedures are currently used in research studies, these methods are not completely reliable and are also time-consuming and labor-intensive. Genome editing technologies, such as zinc finger nucleases, transcription activator-like effector nucleases, and the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/Cas9 (CRISPR/Cas9) system, which are designed to target specific DNA sequences, represent highly promising potential therapeutic tools. In particular, the CRISPR/Cas9 system is an easily customizable sequence-specific nuclease with high flexibility and may be the most feasible approach to target HBV cccDNA. Further research to develop easier, safer, and more effective protocols should be pursued.	M Ohno|M Otsuka|T Kishikawa|T Yoshikawa|A Takata|K Koike
26109514	Viruses are highly abundant in marine subsurface sediments and can even exceed the number of prokaryotes. However, their activity and quantitative impact on microbial populations are still poorly understood. Here, we use gene expression data from published continental margin subseafloor metatranscriptomes to qualitatively assess viral diversity and activity in sediments up to 159 metres below seafloor (mbsf). Mining of the metatranscriptomic data revealed 4651 representative viral homologues (RVHs), representing 2.2% of all metatranscriptome sequence reads, which have close translated homology (average 77%, range 60-97% amino acid identity) to viral proteins. Archaea-infecting RVHs are exclusively detected in the upper 30 mbsf, whereas RVHs for filamentous inoviruses predominate in the deepest sediment layers. RVHs indicative of lysogenic phage-host interactions and lytic activity, notably cell lysis, are detected at all analysed depths and suggest a dynamic virus-host association in the marine deep biosphere studied here. Ongoing lytic viral activity is further indicated by the expression of clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeat-associated cascade genes involved in cellular defence against viral attacks. The data indicate the activity of viruses in subsurface sediment of the Peruvian margin and suggest that viruses indeed cause cell mortality and may play an important role in the turnover of subseafloor microbial biomass.

26103720	Technique of homologous recombination based gene targeting developed in the late 1980s and won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2007. However, this technique could only performed in mice which embryonic stem (ES) cells could keep in the potential of multifunction in vitro. Therefore gene knockout technology was difficult to be applied in other species of animals for a long time. Since 2008, with the development of the new technologies, such as the new ES cell gene targeting, zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and clusters of regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/Cas9 (CRISPR/Cas9), building gene knockout in large and medium animals models which are similar to human in disease research becomes possible. This review describes some new gene knockout technologies in large and medium animal models for recent years.	XJ Liu|H Wang|F Yan|MM Gao|GQ Liu|W Huang
26098369	Although CRISPR-Cas9 nucleases are widely used for genome editing, the range of sequences that Cas9 can recognize is constrained by the need for a specific protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). As a result, it can often be difficult to target double-stranded breaks (DSBs) with the precision that is necessary for various genome-editing applications. The ability to engineer Cas9 derivatives with purposefully altered PAM specificities would address this limitation. Here we show that the commonly used Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) can be modified to recognize alternative PAM sequences using structural information, bacterial selection-based directed evolution, and combinatorial design. These altered PAM specificity variants enable robust editing of endogenous gene sites in zebrafish and human cells not currently targetable by wild-type SpCas9, and their genome-wide specificities are comparable to wild-type SpCas9 as judged by GUIDE-seq analysis. In addition, we identify and characterize another SpCas9 variant that exhibits improved specificity in human cells, possessing better discrimination against off-target sites with non-canonical NAG and NGA PAMs and/or mismatched spacers. We also find that two smaller-size Cas9 orthologues, Streptococcus thermophilus Cas9 (St1Cas9) and Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 (SaCas9), function efficiently in the bacterial selection systems and in human cells, suggesting that our engineering strategies could be extended to Cas9s from other species. Our findings provide broadly useful SpCas9 variants and, more importantly, establish the feasibility of engineering a wide range of Cas9s with altered and improved PAM specificities.

26096991	Microinjection is considered the gold standard technique for delivery of nucleic acids (NAs; transgenes or genome editing tools such as CRISPR/Cas9 systems) into embryos, for creating genetically modified organisms. It requires sophisticated equipment as well as well-trained and highly skilled personnel to perform the micro-injection technique. Here, we describe a novel and simple microinjection-independent technique, called Genome-editing via Oviductal Nucleic Acids Delivery (GONAD). Using GONAD, we show that NAs (e.g., eGFP mRNA or Cas9 mRNA/sgRNAs) can be effectively delivered to pre-implantation embryos within the intact mouse oviduct by a simple electroporation method, and result in the desired genetic modification in the embryos. Thus GONAD can bypass many complex steps in transgenic technology such as isolation of zygotes, microinjection of NAs into them, and their subsequent transfer to pseudo-pregnant animals. Furthermore, this method can potentially be used for genome editing in species other than mice.	G Takahashi|CB Gurumurthy|K Wada|H Miura|M Sato|M Ohtsuka

26087476	NANOG expression in prostate cancer is highly correlated with cancer stem cell characteristics and resistance to androgen deprivation. However, it is not clear whether NANOG or its pseudogenes contribute to the malignant potential of cancer. We established NANOG- and NANOGP8-knockout DU145 prostate cancer cell lines using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Knockouts of NANOG and NANOGP8 significantly attenuated malignant potential, including sphere formation, anchorage-independent growth, migration capability, and drug resistance, compared to parental DU145 cells. NANOG and NANOGP8 knockout did not inhibit in vitro cell proliferation, but in vivo tumorigenic potential decreased significantly. These phenotypes were recovered in NANOG- and NANOGP8-rescued cell lines. These results indicate that NANOG and NANOGP8 proteins are expressed in prostate cancer cell lines, and NANOG and NANOGP8 equally contribute to the high malignant potential of prostate cancer.

26086867	CRISPR/Cas9 derived from the bacterial adaptive immunity pathway is a powerful tool for genome editing, but the safety profiles of in vivo delivered Cas9 (including host immune responses to the bacterial Cas9 protein) have not been comprehensively investigated in model organisms. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a prevalent human liver disease characterized by excessive fat accumulation in the liver. In this study, we used adenovirus (Ad) vector to deliver a Streptococcus pyogenes-derived Cas9 system (SpCas9) targeting Pten, a gene involved in NASH and a negative regulator of the PI3K-AKT pathway, in mouse liver. We found that the Ad vector mediated efficient Pten gene editing even in the presence of typical Ad vector-associated immunotoxicity in the liver. Four months after vector infusion, mice receiving the Pten gene-editing Ad vector showed massive hepatomegaly and features of NASH, consistent with the phenotypes following Cre-loxP-induced Pten deficiency in mouse liver. We also detected induction of humoral immunity against SpCas9 and the potential presence of an SpCas9-specific cellular immune response. Our findings provide a strategy to model human liver diseases in mice and highlight the importance considering Cas9-specific immune responses in future translational studies involving in vivo delivery of CRISPR/Cas9.

26085541	CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) is a microbial immune system against foreign DNA. Recognition sequences (spacers) encoded within the CRISPR array mediate the immune reaction in a sequence-specific manner. The known mechanisms for the evolution of CRISPR arrays include spacer acquisition from foreign DNA elements at the time of invasion and array erosion through spacer deletion. Here, we consider the contribution of genetic recombination between homologous CRISPR arrays to the evolution of spacer repertoire. Acquisition of spacers from exogenic arrays via recombination may confer the recipient with immunity against unencountered antagonists. For this purpose, we develop a novel method for the detection of recombination in CRISPR arrays by modeling the spacer order in arrays from multiple strains from the same species. Because the evolutionary signal of spacer recombination may be similar to that of pervasive spacer deletions or independent spacer acquisition, our method entails a robustness analysis of the recombination inference by a statistical comparison to resampled and perturbed data sets. We analyze CRISPR data sets from four bacterial species: two Gammaproteobacteria species harboring CRISPR type I and two Streptococcus species harboring CRISPR type II loci. We find that CRISPR array evolution in Escherichia coli and Streptococcus agalactiae can be explained solely by vertical inheritance and differential spacer deletion. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we find an excess of single spacers potentially incorporated into the CRISPR locus during independent acquisition events. In Streptococcus thermophilus, evidence for spacer acquisition by recombination is present in 5 out of 70 strains. Genetic recombination has been proposed to accelerate adaptation by combining beneficial mutations that arose in independent lineages. However, for most species under study, we find that CRISPR evolution is shaped mainly by spacer acquisition and loss rather than recombination. Since the evolution of spacer content is characterized by a rapid turnover, it is likely that recombination is not beneficial for improving phage resistance in the strains under study, or that it cannot be detected in the resolution of intraspecies comparisons.

26080436	Genomic analysis of Streptococcus thermophilus revealed that mobile genetic elements (MGEs) likely contributed to gene acquisition and loss during evolutionary adaptation to milk. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-CRISPR-associated genes (CRISPR-Cas), the adaptive immune system in bacteria, limits genetic diversity by targeting MGEs including bacteriophages, transposons, and plasmids. CRISPR-Cas systems are widespread in streptococci, suggesting that the interplay between CRISPR-Cas systems and MGEs is one of the driving forces governing genome homeostasis in this genus. To investigate the genetic outcomes resulting from CRISPR-Cas targeting of integrated MGEs, in silico prediction revealed four genomic islands without essential genes in lengths from 8 to 102 kbp, totaling 7% of the genome. In this study, the endogenous CRISPR3 type II system was programmed to target the four islands independently through plasmid-based expression of engineered CRISPR arrays. Targeting lacZ within the largest 102-kbp genomic island was lethal to wild-type cells and resulted in a reduction of up to 2.5-log in the surviving population. Genotyping of Lac(-) survivors revealed variable deletion events between the flanking insertion-sequence elements, all resulting in elimination of the Lac-encoding island. Chimeric insertion sequence footprints were observed at the deletion junctions after targeting all of the four genomic islands, suggesting a common mechanism of deletion via recombination between flanking insertion sequences. These results established that self-targeting CRISPR-Cas systems may direct significant evolution of bacterial genomes on a population level, influencing genome homeostasis and remodeling.

26078042	Like most of the tools that enable modern life science research, the recent genome-editing revolution has its biological roots in the world of bacteria and archaea. Clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) loci are found in the genomes of many bacteria and most archaea, and underlie an adaptive immune system that protects the host cell against invasive nucleic acids such as viral genomes. In recent years, engineered versions of these systems have enabled efficient DNA targeting in living cells from dozens of species (including humans and other eukaryotes), and the exploitation of the resulting endogenous DNA repair pathways has provided a route to fast, easy, and affordable genome editing. In only three years after RNA-guided DNA cleavage was first harnessed, the ability to edit genomes via simple, user-defined RNA sequences has already revolutionized nearly all areas of biological science. CRISPR-based technologies are now poised to similarly revolutionize many facets of clinical medicine, and even promise to advance the long-term goal of directly editing genomic sequences of patients with inherited disease. In this review, we describe the biological and mechanistic basis for these remarkable immune systems, and how their engineered derivatives are revolutionizing basic and clinical research.

26071038	Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes play important roles in the cell by mediating basic cellular processes, including gene expression and its regulation. Understanding the molecular details of these processes requires the identification and characterization of protein-RNA interactions. Over the years various approaches have been used to investigate these interactions, including computational analyses to look for RNA binding domains, gel-shift mobility assays on recombinant and mutant proteins as well as co-crystallization and NMR studies for structure elucidation. Here we report a more specialized and direct approach using UV-induced cross-linking coupled with mass spectrometry. This approach permits the identification of cross-linked peptides and RNA moieties and can also pin-point exact RNA contact sites within the protein. The power of this method is illustrated by the application to different single- and multi-subunit RNP complexes belonging to the prokaryotic adaptive immune system, CRISPR-Cas (CRISPR: clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats; Cas: CRISPR associated). In particular, we identified the RNA-binding sites within three Cas7 protein homologs and mapped the cross-linking results to reveal structurally conserved Cas7 - RNA binding interfaces. These results demonstrate the strong potential of UV-induced cross-linking coupled with mass spectrometry analysis to identify RNA interaction sites on the RNA binding proteins.

26070541	Recently established, custom-designed nuclease technologies such as the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-associated system provide attractive genome editing tools. Targeted gene mutagenesis using the CRISPR/Cas9 system has been achieved in several orders of insects. However, outside of studies on Drosophila melanogaster and the lepidopteron model insect Bombyx mori, little success has been reported, which is largely due to a lack of effective genetic manipulation tools that can be used in other insect orders. To create a simple and effective method of gene knockout analysis, especially for dissecting gene functioning during insect embryogenesis, we performed a functional analysis of the Bombyx Wnt1 (BmWnt1) gene using Cas9/sgRNA-mediated gene mutagenesis. The Wnt1 gene is required for embryonic patterning in various organisms, and its crucial roles during embryogenesis have been demonstrated in several insect orders. Direct injection of Cas9 mRNA and BmWnt1-specific sgRNA into Bombyx embryos induced a typical Wnt-deficient phenotype: injected embryos could not hatch and exhibited severe defects in body segmentation and pigmentation in a dose-dependent manner. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed that Hox genes were down-regulated after BmWnt1 depletion. Furthermore, large deletion, up to 18Kb, ware generated. The current study demonstrates that using the CRISPR/Cas9 system is a promising approach to achieve targeted gene mutagenesis during insect embryogenesis.	Z Zhang|AF Aslam|X Liu|M Li|Y Huang|A Tan
26069964	Yersinia pestis is the causative agent of human plague and is endemic in various African, Asian and American countries. In Madagascar, the disease represents a significant public health problem with hundreds of human cases a year. Unfortunately, poor infrastructure makes outbreak investigations challenging.	DNA was extracted directly from 93 clinical samples from patients with a clinical diagnosis of plague in Madagascar in 2007. The extracted DNAs were then genotyped using three molecular genotyping methods, including, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) typing, multi-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA), and Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) analysis. These methods provided increasing resolution, respectively. The results of these analyses revealed that, in 2007, ten molecular groups, two newly described here and eight previously identified, were responsible for causing human plague in geographically distinct areas of Madagascar.	Plague in Madagascar is caused by numerous distinct types of Y. pestis. Genotyping method choice should be based upon the discriminatory power needed, expense, and available data for any desired comparisons. We conclude that genotyping should be a standard tool used in epidemiological investigations of plague outbreaks.

26068752	The programmable RNA-guided DNA cleavage activity of the bacterial CRISPR-associated endonuclease Cas9 is the basis of genome editing applications in numerous model organisms and cell types. In a binary complex with a dual crRNA:tracrRNA guide or single-molecule guide RNA, Cas9 targets double-stranded DNAs harboring sequences complementary to a 20-nucleotide segment in the guide RNA. Recent structural studies of the enzyme have uncovered the molecular mechanism of RNA-guided DNA recognition. Here, we provide protocols for electrophoretic mobility shift and fluorescence-detection size exclusion chromatography assays used to probe DNA binding by Cas9 that allowed us to reconstitute and crystallize the enzyme in a ternary complex with a guide RNA and a bona fide target DNA. The procedures can be used for further mechanistic investigations of the Cas9 endonuclease family and are potentially applicable to other multicomponent protein-nucleic acid complexes.

26068008	Genome editing using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR associated 9 (Cas9) technology is revolutionizing the study of gene function and likely will give rise to an entire new class of therapeutics for a wide range of diseases. Achieving this goal requires not only characterization of the technology for efficacy and specificity but also optimization of its delivery to the target cells for each disease indication. In this review we survey the various methods by which the CRISPR-Cas9 components have been delivered to cells and highlight some of the more clinically relevant approaches. Additionally, we discuss the methods available for assessing the specificity of Cas9 editing; an important safety consideration for development of the technology.

26065872	Gene targeting is a critical approach for characterizing gene functions in modern biomedical research. However, the efficiency of gene targeting in human cells has been low, which prevents the generation of human cell lines at a desired rate. The past two years have witnessed a rapid progression on improving efficiency of genetic manipulation by genome editing tools such as the CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats)/Cas (CRISPR-associated) system. This manuscript describes a protocol for generating lineage specific human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) reporters using CRISPR/Cas system assisted homologous recombination. Procedures for obtaining necessary components for making neural lineage reporter lines using the CRISPR/Cas system, focusing on construction of targeting vectors and single guide RNAs, are described. This protocol can be extended to platform establishment and mutation correction in hiPSCs.	S Li|H Xue|B Long|L Sun|T Truong|Y Liu
26063738	The CRISPR/Cas9 system has revolutionized mammalian somatic cell genetics. Genome-wide functional screens using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout or dCas9 fusion-mediated inhibition/activation (CRISPRi/a) are powerful techniques for discovering phenotype-associated gene function. We systematically assessed the DNA sequence features that contribute to single guide RNA (sgRNA) efficiency in CRISPR-based screens. Leveraging the information from multiple designs, we derived a new sequence model for predicting sgRNA efficiency in CRISPR/Cas9 knockout experiments. Our model confirmed known features and suggested new features including a preference for cytosine at the cleavage site. The model was experimentally validated for sgRNA-mediated mutation rate and protein knockout efficiency. Tested on independent data sets, the model achieved significant results in both positive and negative selection conditions and outperformed existing models. We also found that the sequence preference for CRISPRi/a is substantially different from that for CRISPR/Cas9 knockout and propose a new model for predicting sgRNA efficiency in CRISPRi/a experiments. These results facilitate the genome-wide design of improved sgRNA for both knockout and CRISPRi/a studies.	H Xu|T Xiao|CH Chen|W Li|CA Meyer|Q Wu|D Wu|L Cong|F Zhang|JS Liu|M Brown|XS Liu
26060300	The increasing threat of pathogen resistance to antibiotics requires the development of novel antimicrobial strategies. Here we present a proof of concept for a genetic strategy that aims to sensitize bacteria to antibiotics and selectively kill antibiotic-resistant bacteria. We use temperate phages to deliver a functional clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated (Cas) system into the genome of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The delivered CRISPR-Cas system destroys both antibiotic resistance-conferring plasmids and genetically modified lytic phages. This linkage between antibiotic sensitization and protection from lytic phages is a key feature of the strategy. It allows programming of lytic phages to kill only antibiotic-resistant bacteria while protecting antibiotic-sensitized bacteria. Phages designed according to this strategy may be used on hospital surfaces and hand sanitizers to facilitate replacement of antibiotic-resistant pathogens with sensitive ones.

26059412	Genome engineering and human iPS cells are two powerful technologies, which can be combined to highlight phenotypic differences and identify pathological mechanisms of complex diseases by providing isogenic cellular material. However, very few data are available regarding precise gene correction in human iPS cells. Here, we describe an optimized stepwise protocol to deliver CRISPR/Cas9 plasmids in human iPS cells. We highlight technical issues especially those associated to human stem cell culture and to the correction of a point mutation to obtain isogenic iPS cell line, without inserting any resistance cassette. Based on a two-steps clonal isolation protocol (mechanical picking followed by enzymatic dissociation), we succeed to select and expand corrected human iPS cell line with a great efficiency (more than 2% of the sequenced colonies). This protocol can also be used to obtain knock-out cell line from healthy iPS cell line by the NHEJ pathway (with about 15% efficiency) and reproduce disease phenotype. In addition, we also provide protocols for functional validation tests after every critical step.	B Grobarczyk|B Franco|K Hanon|B Malgrange
26057804	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-derived RNA (crRNA) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins constitute a prokaryotic adaptive immune system (CRISPR-Cas system) that targets and degrades invading genetic elements. The type III-B CRISPR-Cas Cmr complex, composed of the six Cas proteins (Cmr1-Cmr6) and a crRNA, captures and cleaves RNA complementary to the crRNA guide sequence. Here, a Cmr1-deficient functional Cmr (CmrΔ1) complex composed of Pyrococcus furiosus Cmr2-Cmr3, Archaeoglobus fulgidus Cmr4-Cmr5-Cmr6 and the 39-mer P. furiosus 7.01-crRNA was prepared. The CmrΔ1 complex was cocrystallized with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) complementary to the crRNA guide by the vapour-diffusion method. The crystals diffracted to 2.1 Å resolution using synchrotron radiation at the Photon Factory. The crystals belonged to the triclinic space group P1, with unit-cell parameters a = 75.5, b = 76.2, c = 139.2 Å, α = 90.3, β = 104.8, γ = 118.6°. The asymmetric unit of the crystals is expected to contain one CmrΔ1-ssDNA complex, with a Matthews coefficient of 2.03 Å(3) Da(-1) and a solvent content of 39.5%.	T Osawa|H Inanaga|T Numata
26057433	Genome editing, which introduces mutations in genes of interest using artificial DNA nucleases such as the ZFN, TALEN, and CRISPR/Cas9 systems in living cells, is a useful tool for generating mutant animals. Although CRISPR/Cas9 provides advantages over the two other systems, such as an easier vector construction and high efficiency of genome editing, it raises concerns of off-target effects when single guide RNA (gRNA) is used. Recently, FokI-dCas9 (fCas9), a fusion protein comprised of the inactivated mutant form of Cas9 and the DNA nuclease domain of FokI, has been developed. It enables genome editing with reduced risks of off-target effects in mammalian cultured cell lines, as fCas9 requires gRNAs to bind opposite strands with an appropriate distance between them. Here, we demonstrated that fCas9 efficiently generates living mutant mice through microinjection of its mRNA and gRNAs into zygotes. A comparison of the relative efficiencies of genome editing using fCas9 and other modified Cas9s showed that these mutagenesis efficiencies are similar when the targets of two gRNAs are separated by an appropriate distance, suggesting that in addition to the ease of vector construction, fCas9 exhibit high efficiency in producing mutant mice and in reducing risks of off-target effects.

26048892	For more than a decade, RNA interference (RNAi) has brought about an entirely new approach to functional genomics screening. Enabling high-throughput loss-of-function (LOF) screens against the human genome, identifying new drug targets, and significantly advancing experimental biology, RNAi is a fast, flexible technology that is compatible with existing high-throughput systems and processes; however, the recent advent of clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas, a powerful new precise genome-editing (PGE) technology, has opened up vast possibilities for functional genomics. CRISPR-Cas is novel in its simplicity: one piece of easily engineered guide RNA (gRNA) is used to target a gene sequence, and Cas9 expression is required in the cells. The targeted double-strand break introduced by the gRNA-Cas9 complex is highly effective at removing gene expression compared to RNAi. Together with the reduced cost and complexity of CRISPR-Cas, there is the realistic opportunity to use PGE to screen for phenotypic effects in a total gene knockout background. This review summarizes the exciting development of CRISPR-Cas as a high-throughput screening tool, comparing its future potential to that of well-established RNAi screening techniques, and highlighting future challenges and opportunities within these disciplines. We conclude that the two technologies actually complement rather than compete with each other, enabling greater understanding of the genome in relation to drug discovery.	J Taylor|S Woodcock
26048003	The pathway of CRISPR-Cas immunity redefines the roles of RNA in the flow of genetic information and ignites excitement for next-generation gene therapy tools. CRISPR-Cas machineries offer a fascinating set of new enzyme assemblies from which one can learn principles of molecular interactions and chemical activities. The interference step of the CRISPR-Cas immunity pathway congregates proteins, RNA, and DNA into a single molecular entity that selectively destroys invading nucleic acids. Although much remains to be discovered, a picture of how the interference process takes place is emerging. This review focuses on the current structural data for the three known types of RNA-guided nucleic acid interference mechanisms. In it, we describe key features of individual complexes and we emphasize comparisons across types and along functional stages. We aim to provide readers with a set of core principles learned from the three types of interference complexes and a deep appreciation of the diversity among them.	TK Tsui|H Li
26044730	Precise genome editing by the Cas9 nuclease depends on exogenously provided templates for homologous recombination. Here, we compare oligonucleotides with short homology and circular DNA molecules with extensive homology to genomic targets as templates for homology-based repair of CRISPR/Cas9 induced double-strand breaks. We find oligonucleotides to be templates of choice for introducing small sequence changes into the genome based on editing efficiency and ease of use. We show that polarity of oligonucleotide templates greatly affects repair efficiency: oligonucleotides in the sense orientation with respect to the target gene are better templates. In addition, combining a gene loss-of-function phenotype screen with detection of integrated fluorescent markers, we demonstrate that targeted knock-ins in Caenorhabditis elegans also can be achieved by homology-independent repair.

26043872	Targeted knockout of genes in primary human cells using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome-editing represents a powerful approach to study gene function and to discern molecular mechanisms underlying complex human diseases. We used lentiviral delivery of CRISPR-Cas9 machinery and conditional reprogramming culture methods to knockout the MUC18 gene in human primary nasal airway epithelial cells (AECs). Massively parallel sequencing technology was used to confirm that the genome of essentially all cells in the edited AEC populations contained coding region insertions and deletions (indels). Correspondingly, we found mRNA expression of MUC18 was greatly reduced and protein expression was absent. Characterization of MUC18 knockout cell populations stimulated with TLR2, 3 and 4 agonists revealed that IL-8 (a proinflammatory chemokine) responses of AECs were greatly reduced in the absence of functional MUC18 protein. Our results show the feasibility of CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene knockouts in AEC culture (both submerged and polarized), and suggest a proinflammatory role for MUC18 in airway epithelial response to bacterial and viral stimuli.

26039254	Plant trait engineering requires efficient targeted genome-editing technologies. Clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats (CRISPRs)/ CRISPR associated (Cas) type II system is used for targeted genome-editing applications across eukaryotic species including plants. Delivery of genome engineering reagents and recovery of mutants remain challenging tasks for in planta applications. Recently, we reported the development of Tobacco rattle virus (TRV)-mediated genome editing in Nicotiana benthamiana. TRV infects the growing points and possesses small genome size; which facilitate cloning, multiplexing, and agroinfections. Here, we report on the persistent activity and specificity of the TRV-mediated CRISPR/Cas9 system for targeted modification of the Nicotiana benthamiana genome. Our data reveal the persistence of the TRV- mediated Cas9 activity for up to 30 d post-agroinefection. Further, our data indicate that TRV-mediated genome editing exhibited no off-target activities at potential off-targets indicating the precision of the system for plant genome engineering. Taken together, our data establish the feasibility and exciting possibilities of using virus-mediated CRISPR/Cas9 for targeted engineering of plant genomes.	Z Ali|A Abul-Faraj|M Piatek|MM Mahfouz
26035832	Small RNAs, including siRNAs, gRNAs and miRNAs, modulate gene expression and serve as potential therapies for human diseases. Delivery to target cells remains the fundamental limitation for use of these RNAs in humans. To address this challenge, we have developed a nanocapsule delivery technology that encapsulates small DNA molecules encoding RNAs into a small (30 nm) polymer nanocapsule. For proof of concept, we transduced DNA expression cassettes for three small RNAs. In one application, the DNA cassette encodes an shRNA transcriptional unit that downregulates CCR5 and protects from HIV-1 infection. The DNA cassette nanocapsules were further engineered for timed release of the DNA cargo for prolonged knockdown of CCR5. Secondly, the nanocapsules provide an efficient means for delivery of gRNAs in the CRISPR/Cas9 system to mutate integrated HIV-1. Finally, delivery of microRNA-125b to mobilized human CD34+ cells enhances survival and expansion of the CD34+ cells in culture.	M Yan|J Wen|M Liang|Y Lu|M Kamata|IS Chen
26035283	Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is prevalent, deadly, and seldom cured due to the persistence of viral episomal DNA (cccDNA) in infected cells. Newly developed genome engineering tools may offer the ability to directly cleave viral DNA, thereby promoting viral clearance. Here, we show that the CRISPR/Cas9 system can specifically target and cleave conserved regions in the HBV genome, resulting in robust suppression of viral gene expression and replication. Upon sustained expression of Cas9 and appropriately chosen guide RNAs, we demonstrate cleavage of cccDNA by Cas9 and a dramatic reduction in both cccDNA and other parameters of viral gene expression and replication. Thus, we show that directly targeting viral episomal DNA is a novel therapeutic approach to control the virus and possibly cure patients.

26035392	Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is a recessive autosomal ataxia caused by reduced levels of frataxin (FXN), an essential mitochondrial protein that is highly conserved from bacteria to primates. The exact role of frataxin and its primary function remain unclear although this information would be very valuable to design a therapeutic approach for FRDA. A main difficulty encountered so far has been that of establishing a clear temporal relationship between the different observations that could allow a distinction between causes and secondary effects, and provide a clear link between aging and disease development. To approach this problem, we developed a cellular model in which we can switch off/on in a time-controlled way the frataxin gene partially mimicking what happens in the disease. We exploited the TALEN and CRISPR methodologies to engineer a cell line where the presence of an exogenous, inducible FXN gene rescues the cells from the knockout of the two endogenous FXN genes. This system allows the possibility of testing the progression of disease and is a valuable tool for following the phenotype with different newly acquired markers.

26032266	Mosaic mutations and off-target effects caused by CRISPR/Cas9 have led to concerns about the efficiency and specificity of this new technique in non-human primates and other large animals.

26030444	Noncoding RNAs play diverse roles throughout biology and exhibit broad functional capacity. To investigate and harness these capabilities, we developed clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Display (CRISP-Disp), a targeted localization method that uses Cas9 to deploy large RNA cargos to DNA loci. We demonstrate that functional RNA domains up to at least 4.8 kb long can be inserted in CRISPR guide RNA at multiple points, allowing the construction of Cas9 complexes with protein-binding cassettes, artificial aptamers, pools of random sequences and natural long noncoding RNAs. A unique feature of CRISP-Disp is the multiplexing of distinct functions at multiple targets, limited only by the availability of functional RNA motifs. We anticipate the use of CRISP-Disp for ectopically targeting functional RNAs and ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes to genomic loci.	DM Shechner|E Hacisuleyman|ST Younger|JL Rinn
26028539	Bacteria and archaea rely on CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) RNA-guided adaptive immune systems for targeted elimination of foreign nucleic acids. These immune systems have been divided into three main types, and the first atomic-resolution structure of a type III RNA-guided immune complex provides new insights into the mechanisms of nucleic acid degradation. Here we compare the crystal structure of a type III complex to recently determined structures of DNA-targeting type I CRISPR complexes. Structural comparisons support previous assertions that type I and type III systems share a common ancestor and reveal how a conserved structural chassis is used to support RNA-, DNA-, or both RNA- and DNA-targeting mechanisms.

26028531	The development of new gene-editing tools, in particular the CRISPR/Cas system, has greatly facilitated site-specific mutagenesis in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), including the introduction or correction of patient-specific mutations for disease modeling. However, integration of a reporter gene into an endogenous locus in hESCs still requires a lengthy and laborious two-step strategy that involves first drug selection to identify correctly targeted clones and then excision of the drug-resistance cassette. Through the use of iCRISPR, an efficient gene-editing platform we recently developed, this study demonstrates a knockin strategy without drug selection for both active and silent genes in hESCs. Lineage-specific hESC reporter lines are useful for real-time monitoring of cell-fate decisions and lineage tracing, as well as enrichment of specific cell populations during hESC differentiation. Thus, this selection-free knockin strategy is expected to greatly facilitate the use of hESCs for developmental studies, disease modeling, and cell-replacement therapy.

26018130	Although chromosomal deletions and inversions are important in cancer, conventional methods for detecting DNA rearrangements require laborious indirect assays. Here we develop fluorescent reporters to rapidly quantify CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletions and inversions. We find that inversion depends on the non-homologous end-joining enzyme LIG4. We also engineer deletions and inversions for a 50 kb Pten genomic region in mouse liver. We discover diverse yet sequence-specific indels at the rearrangement fusion sites. Moreover, we detect Cas9 cleavage at the fourth nucleotide on the non-complementary strand, leading to staggered instead of blunt DNA breaks. These reporters allow mechanisms of chromosomal rearrangements to be investigated.

26013482	The CRISPR-Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated genes) system provides prokaryotic cells with an adaptive and heritable immune response to foreign genetic elements, such as viruses, plasmids, and transposons. It is present in the majority of Archaea and almost half of species of Bacteria. Porphyromonas gingivalis is an important human pathogen that has been proven to be an etiological agent of periodontitis and has been linked to systemic conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and cardiovascular disease. At least 95% of clinical strains of P. gingivalis carry CRISPR arrays, suggesting that these arrays play an important function in vivo. Here we show that all four CRISPR arrays present in the P. gingivalis W83 genome are transcribed. For one of the arrays, we demonstrate in vivo activity against double-stranded DNA constructs containing protospacer sequences accompanied at the 3' end by an NGG protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM). Most of the 44 spacers present in the genome of P. gingivalis W83 share no significant similarity with any known sequences, although 4 spacers are similar to sequences from bacteria found in the oral cavity and the gastrointestinal tract. Four spacers match genomic sequences of the host; however, none of these is flanked at its 3' terminus by the appropriate PAM element.	The CRISPR-Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated genes) system is a unique system that provides prokaryotic cells with an adaptive and heritable immunity. In this report, we show that the CRISPR-Cas system of P. gingivalis, an important human pathogen associated with periodontitis and possibly also other conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and cardiovascular disease, is active and provides protection from foreign genetic elements. Importantly, the data presented here may be useful for better understanding the communication between cells in larger bacterial communities and, consequently, the process of disease development and progression.

26003884	CRISPR-Cas9 systems provide a platform for high efficiency genome editing that are enabling innovative applications of mammalian cell engineering. However, the delivery of Cas9 and synthesis of guide RNA (gRNA) remain as steps that can limit overall efficiency and ease of use. Here we describe methods for rapid synthesis of gRNA and for delivery of Cas9 protein/gRNA ribonucleoprotein complexes (Cas9 RNPs) into a variety of mammalian cells through liposome-mediated transfection or electroporation. Using these methods, we report nuclease-mediated indel rates of up to 94% in Jurkat T cells and 87% in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) for a single target. When we used this approach for multigene targeting in Jurkat cells we found that two-locus and three-locus indels were achieved in approximately 93% and 65% of the resulting isolated cell lines, respectively. Further, we found that the off-target cleavage rate is reduced using Cas9 protein when compared to plasmid DNA transfection. Taken together, we present a streamlined cell engineering workflow that enables gRNA design to analysis of edited cells in as little as four days and results in highly efficient genome modulation in hard-to-transfect cells. The reagent preparation and delivery to cells is amenable to high throughput, multiplexed genome-wide cell engineering.

26000842	Few discoveries transform a discipline overnight, but biologists today can manipulate cells in ways never possible before, thanks to a peculiar form of prokaryotic adaptive immunity mediated by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR). From elegant studies that deciphered how these immune systems function in bacteria, researchers quickly uncovered the technological potential of Cas9, an RNA-guided DNA cleaving enzyme, for genome engineering. Here we highlight the recent explosion in visionary applications of CRISPR-Cas9 that promises to usher in a new era of biological understanding and control.	SH Sternberg|JA Doudna
25999583	The Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeat/CRISPR associated (CRISPR/Cas) technology allows rapid, site-specific genome modification in a wide variety of organisms . Proof-of-principle studies in Drosophila melanogaster have used various CRISPR/Cas tools and experimental designs, leading to significant uncertainty in the community about how to put this technology into practice. Moreover, it is unclear what proportion of genomic target sites can be modified with high efficiency. Here, we address these issues by systematically evaluating available CRISPR/Cas reagents and methods in Drosophila. Our findings allow evidence-based choices of Cas9 sources and strategies for generating knock-in alleles. We perform gene editing at a large number of target sites using a highly active Cas9 line and a collection of transgenic gRNA strains. The vast majority of target sites can be mutated with remarkable efficiency using these tools. We contrast our method to recently developed autonomous gene drive technology for somatic and germline genome engineering and conclude that optimized CRISPR with independent transgenes is as efficient, more versatile, and does not represent a biosafety risk.

25999371	Sex determination in the mosquito Aedes aegypti is governed by a dominant male-determining factor (M factor) located within a Y chromosome-like region called the M locus. Here, we show that an M-locus gene, Nix, functions as an M factor in A. aegypti. Nix exhibits persistent M linkage and early embryonic expression, two characteristics required of an M factor. Nix knockout with clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 resulted in largely feminized genetic males and the production of female isoforms of two key regulators of sexual differentiation: doublesex and fruitless. Ectopic expression of Nix resulted in genetic females with nearly complete male genitalia. Thus, Nix is both required and sufficient to initiate male development. This study provides a foundation for mosquito control strategies that convert female mosquitoes into harmless males.

25998815	A high-resolution functional metagenomic analysis of a representative single sample of a Brazilian spontaneous cocoa bean fermentation process was carried out to gain insight into its bacterial community functioning. By reconstruction of microbial meta-pathways based on metagenomic data, the current knowledge about the metabolic capabilities of bacterial members involved in the cocoa bean fermentation ecosystem was extended. Functional meta-pathway analysis revealed the distribution of the metabolic pathways between the bacterial members involved. The metabolic capabilities of the lactic acid bacteria present were most associated with the heterolactic fermentation and citrate assimilation pathways. The role of Enterobacteriaceae in the conversion of substrates was shown through the use of the mixed-acid fermentation and methylglyoxal detoxification pathways. Furthermore, several other potential functional roles for Enterobacteriaceae were indicated, such as pectinolysis and citrate assimilation. Concerning acetic acid bacteria, metabolic pathways were partially reconstructed, in particular those related to responses toward stress, explaining their metabolic activities during cocoa bean fermentation processes. Further, the in-depth metagenomic analysis unveiled functionalities involved in bacterial competitiveness, such as the occurrence of CRISPRs and potential bacteriocin production. Finally, comparative analysis of the metagenomic data with bacterial genomes of cocoa bean fermentation isolates revealed the applicability of the selected strains as functional starter cultures.

25998712	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are critical regulators of gene expression. Amplification and overexpression of individual 'oncomiRs' or genetic loss of tumour suppressor miRNAs are associated with human cancer and are sufficient to drive tumorigenesis in mouse models. Furthermore, global miRNA depletion caused by genetic and epigenetic alterations in components of the miRNA biogenesis machinery is oncogenic. This, together with the recent identification of novel miRNA regulatory factors and pathways, highlights the importance of miRNA dysregulation in cancer.	S Lin|RI Gregory
25998428	The RNA-guided Cas9 nuclease from microbial clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) adaptive immune system has been used to facilitate efficient genome engineering in eukaryotic cells. The specific targeted genome is recognized and cut by gRNA-directed CRISPR/Cas9 complex, specifically by the endonuclease Cas9. The targeted gene locus could be repaired either by homology-directed repair or nonhomologous end joining, thus achieving a desired editing outcome. Viruses infect cells through specific receptors, and then the viral genome is transcribed, replicated and translated to complete its life cycle. As a result, some DNA virus and retrovirus genomes are integrated into the cellular genome. Gene therapy is a new trend to treat viral infected diseases. Given its designable sequence-specific editing of the targeted genome, CRISPR/Cas9 has tremendous potential in treating persistent and latent viral infections. In this review, we summarize the mechanism and progresses of CRISPR/Cas9, and also highlight its therapeutic application in infectious diseases.	LJ Yin|SQ Hu|F Guo
25994645	Gene disruption technology has long been beneficial for the study of male reproductive biology. However, because of the time and cost involved, this technology was not a viable method except in specialist laboratories. The advent of the CRISPR/Cas9 system of gene disruption has ushered in a new era of genetic investigation. Now, it is possible to generate gene-disrupted mouse models in very little time and at very little cost. This Highlight article discusses the application of this technology to study the genetics of male fertility and looks at some of the future uses of this system that could be used to reveal the essential and nonessential genetic components of male reproductive mechanisms.

25994611	CRISPR-Cas is an RNA-mediated adaptive immune system that defends bacteria and archaea against mobile genetic elements. Short mature CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) are key elements in the interference step of the immune pathway. A CRISPR array composed of a series of repeats interspaced by spacer sequences acquired from invading mobile genomes is transcribed as a precursor crRNA (pre-crRNA) molecule. This pre-crRNA undergoes one or two maturation steps to generate the mature crRNAs that guide CRISPR-associated (Cas) protein(s) to cognate invading genomes for their destruction. Different types of CRISPR-Cas systems have evolved distinct crRNA biogenesis pathways that implicate highly sophisticated processing mechanisms. In Types I and III CRISPR-Cas systems, a specific endoribonuclease of the Cas6 family, either standalone or in a complex with other Cas proteins, cleaves the pre-crRNA within the repeat regions. In Type II systems, the trans-acting small RNA (tracrRNA) base pairs with each repeat of the pre-crRNA to form a dual-RNA that is cleaved by the housekeeping RNase III in the presence of the protein Cas9. In this review, we present a detailed comparative analysis of pre-crRNA recognition and cleavage mechanisms involved in the biogenesis of guide crRNAs in the three CRISPR-Cas types.

25994215	Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPRs) are active in acquired resistance against bacteriophage and plasmids in a number of environments. In the human mouth, CRISPR loci evolve to counteract oral phage, but the expression of these CRISPR loci has not previously been investigated. We sequenced cDNA from CRISPR loci found in numerous different oral bacteria and compared with oral phage communities to determine whether the transcription of CRISPR loci is specifically targeted towards highly abundant phage present in the oral environment.	We found that of the 529,027 CRISPR spacer groups studied, 88 % could be identified in transcripts, indicating that the vast majority of CRISPR loci in the oral cavity were transcribed. There were no strong associations between CRISPR spacer repertoires and oral health status or nucleic acid type. We also compared CRISPR repertoires with oral bacteriophage communities, and found that there was no significant association between CRISPR transcripts and oral phage, regardless of the CRISPR type being evaluated. We characterized highly expressed CRISPR spacers and found that they were no more likely than other spacers to match oral phage. By reassembling the CRISPR-bearing reads into longer CRISPR loci, we found that the majority of the loci did not have spacers matching viruses found in the oral cavities of the subjects studied. For some CRISPR types, loci containing spacers matching oral phage were significantly more likely to have multiple spacers rather than a single spacer matching oral phage.	These data suggest that the transcription of oral CRISPR loci is relatively ubiquitous and that highly expressed CRISPR spacers do not necessarily target the most abundant oral phage.

25988366	Once an engineered organism completes its task, it is useful to degrade the associated DNA to reduce environmental release and protect intellectual property. Here we present a genetically encoded device (DNAi) that responds to a transcriptional input and degrades user-defined DNA. This enables engineered regions to be obscured when the cell enters a new environment. DNAi is based on type-IE CRISPR biochemistry and a synthetic CRISPR array defines the DNA target(s). When the input is on, plasmid DNA is degraded 10(8)-fold. When the genome is targeted, this causes cell death, reducing viable cells by a factor of 10(8). Further, the CRISPR nuclease can direct degradation to specific genomic regions (for example, engineered or inserted DNA), which could be used to complicate recovery and sequencing efforts. DNAi can be stably carried in an engineered organism, with no impact on cell growth, plasmid stability or DNAi inducibility even after passaging for >2 months.	BJ Caliando|CA Voigt
25987504	Targeted genome editing mediated by clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated nuclease 9 (Cas9) technology has emerged as one of the most powerful tools to study gene functions, and with potential to treat genetic disorders. Hearing loss is one of the most common sensory disorders, affecting approximately 1 in 500 newborns with no treatment. Mutations of inner ear genes contribute to the largest portion of genetic deafness. The simplicity and robustness of CRISPR/Cas9-directed genome editing in human cells and model organisms such as zebrafish, mice and primates make it a promising technology in hearing research. With CRISPR/Cas9 technology, functions of inner ear genes can be studied efficiently by the disruption of normal gene alleles through non-homologous-end-joining (NHEJ) mechanism. For genetic hearing loss, CRISPR/Cas9 has potential to repair gene mutations by homology-directed-repair (HDR) or to disrupt dominant mutations by NHEJ, which could restore hearing. Our recent work has shown CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing can be efficiently performed in the mammalian inner ear in vivo. Thus, application of CRISPR/Cas9 in hearing research will open up new avenues for understanding the pathology of genetic hearing loss and provide new routes in the development of treatment to restore hearing. In this review, we describe major methodologies currently used for genome editing. We will highlight applications of these technologies in studies of genetic disorders and discuss issues pertaining to applications of CRISPR/Cas9 in auditory systems implicated in genetic hearing loss.

25985872	Programmable nucleases, which include zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and RNA-guided engineered nucleases (RGENs) repurposed from the type II clustered, regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) system are now widely used for genome editing in higher eukaryotic cells and whole organisms, revolutionising almost every discipline in biological research, medicine, and biotechnology. All of these nucleases, however, induce off-target mutations at sites homologous in sequence with on-target sites, limiting their utility in many applications including gene or cell therapy. In this review, we compare methods for detecting nuclease off-target mutations. We also review methods for profiling genome-wide off-target effects and discuss how to reduce or avoid off-target mutations.	T Koo|J Lee|JS Kim
25981485	Clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) interference (CRISPRi) is a powerful technology for sequence-specifically repressing gene expression in bacterial cells. CRISPRi requires only a single protein and a custom-designed guide RNA for specific gene targeting. In Escherichia coli, CRISPRi repression efficiency is high (~300-fold), and there are no observable off-target effects. The method can be scaled up as a general strategy for the repression of many genes simultaneously using multiple designed guide RNAs. Here we provide a protocol for efficient guide RNA design, cloning, and assay of the CRISPRi system in E. coli. In principle, this protocol can be used to construct CRISPRi systems for gene repression in other species of bacteria.	JS Hawkins|S Wong|JM Peters|R Almeida|LS Qi
25981482	Advances in sequencing technology have allowed for the study of complex and previously unexplored microbial and viral populations; however, linking host-phage partners using in silico techniques has been challenging. Here, we describe the flow-through for creation of a virome, and its subsequent analysis with the viral assembly and analysis module "Viritas," which we have recently developed. This module allows for binning of contigs based on tetranucleotide frequencies, putative phage-host partner identification by CRISPR spacer matching, and identification of ORFs.	M Davison|D Bhaya
25981476	Infection of archaea with phylogenetically diverse single viruses, performed in different laboratories, has failed to activate spacer acquisition into host CRISPR loci. The first successful uptake of archaeal de novo spacers was observed on infection of Sulfolobus solfataricus P2 with an environmental virus mixture isolated from Yellowstone National Park (Erdmann and Garrett, Mol Microbiol 85:1044-1056, 2012). Experimental studies of isolated genetic elements from this mixture revealed that SMV1 (S ulfolobus Monocauda Virus 1), a tailed spindle-shaped virus, can induce spacer acquisition in CRISPR loci of Sulfolobus species from a second coinfecting conjugative plasmid or virus (Erdmann and Garrett, Mol Microbiol 85:1044-1056, 2012; Erdmann et al. Mol Microbiol 91:900-917, 2014). Here we describe, firstly, the isolation of archaeal virus mixtures from terrestrial hot springs and the techniques used both to infect laboratory strains with these virus mixtures and to obtain purified virus particles. Secondly, we present the experimental conditions required for activating SMV1-induced spacer acquisition in two different Sulfolobus species.	S Erdmann|RA Garrett
25981475	CRISPR-Cas systems provide immunity in bacteria and archaea against nucleic acids in the form of viral genomes and plasmids, and influence their coevolution. The first main step of CRISPR-Cas activity is the immune adaptation through spacer(s) acquisition into an active CRISPR locus. This step is also mandatory for the final stage of CRISPR-Cas activity, namely interference. This chapter describes general procedures for studying the CRISPR adaptation step, accomplished by producing bacteriophage-insensitive mutants (BIMs) or plasmid-interfering mutants (PIMs) using various spacer acquisition analyses and experiments. Since each bacterial or archaeal species (and even strain) needs specific conditions to optimize the acquisition process, the protocols described below should be thought of as general guidelines and may not be applicable universally, without modification. Because Streptococcus thermophilus was used as the model system in the first published study on novel spacer acquisition and in many studies ever since, the protocols in this chapter describe specific conditions, media, and buffers that have been used with this microorganism. Details for other species will be given when possible, but readers should first evaluate the best growth and storage conditions for each bacterium-foreign element pair (named the procedure settings) and bear in mind the specificity and variability of CRISPR-Cas types and subtypes. Also, we suggest to be mindful of the fact that some CRISPR-Cas systems are not "naturally" active in terms of the ability to acquire novel CRISPR spacers, and that some systems may require specific conditions to induce the CRISPR-Cas activity for spacer acquisition.

25981470	Mass spectrometry is a powerful tool for characterizing RNA. Here we describe a method for the identification and characterisation of crRNA using liquid chromatography interfaced with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC ESI MS). The direct purification of crRNA from the Cascade-crRNA complex was performed using denaturing ion pair reverse phase chromatography. Following purification of the crRNA, the intact mass was determined by LC ESI MS. Using this approach, a significant reduction in metal ion adduct formation of the crRNA was observed. In addition, RNase mapping of the crRNA was performed using RNase digestion in conjunction with liquid chromatography tandem MS analysis. Using the intact mass of the crRNA, in conjunction with RNase mapping experiments enabled the identification and characterisation of the crRNA, providing further insight into crRNA processing in a number of type I CRISPR-Cas systems.

25981469	Macroarray-based analysis is a powerful and economic format to study variations in "clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)" loci in bacteria. To date, it was used almost exclusively for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and was named spoligotyping (spacer oligonucleotides typing). Here, we describe the pipeline of this approach that includes search of loci and selection of spacers, preparation of the membrane with immobilized probes and spoligotyping itself (PCR and reverse hybridization).	I Mokrousov|N Rastogi
25981468	Spoligotyping was developed almost 18 years ago and still remains a popular first-lane genotyping technique to identify and subtype Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) clinical isolates at a phylogeographic level. For other pathogens, such as Salmonella enterica, recent studies suggest that specifically designed spoligotyping techniques could be interesting for public health purposes. Spoligotyping was in its original format a reverse line-blot hybridization method using capture probes designed on "spacers" and attached to a membrane's surface and a PCR product obtained from clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs). Cowan et al. and Fabre et al. were the first to propose a high-throughput Spoligotyping method based on microbeads for MTC and S. enterica serotype Typhimurium, respectively. The main advantages of the high-throughput Spoligotyping techniques we describe here are their low cost, their robustness, and the existence (at least for MTC) of very large databases that allow comparisons between spoligotypes from anywhere.

25981467	The CRISPR-Cas systems in bacteria and archaea provide protection by targeting foreign nucleic acids. The sequence of the "spacers" within CRISPR arrays specifically determines the targets in invader genomes. These spacers provide the short specific RNA nucleotide sequences within the guide crRNAs. In addition to complementarity in the spacer-target (protospacer) interaction, short flanking protospacer adjacent motifs (PAMs), or mismatching flanks have a discriminatory role in accurate target detection. Here, we describe a bioinformatic method, called CRISPRTarget, to use the sequence of a CRISPR array (e.g., predicted via CRISPRDetect/CRISPRDirection) to identify the foreign nucleic acids it targets.

25981466	The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas (CRISPR-associated proteins) is a prokaryotic adaptive immune system that is represented in most archaea and many bacteria. Among the currently known prokaryotic defense systems, the CRISPR-Cas genomic loci show unprecedented complexity and diversity. Classification of CRISPR-Cas variants that would capture their evolutionary relationships to the maximum possible extent is essential for comparative genomic and functional characterization of this theoretically and practically important system of adaptive immunity. To this end, a multipronged approach has been developed that combines phylogenetic analysis of the conserved Cas proteins with comparison of gene repertoires and arrangements in CRISPR-Cas loci. This approach led to the current classification of CRISPR-Cas systems into three distinct types and ten subtypes for each of which signature genes have been identified. Comparative genomic analysis of the CRISPR-Cas systems in new archaeal and bacterial genomes performed over the 3 years elapsed since the development of this classification makes it clear that new types and subtypes of CRISPR-Cas need to be introduced. Moreover, this classification system captures only part of the complexity of CRISPR-Cas organization and evolution, due to the intrinsic modularity and evolutionary mobility of these immunity systems, resulting in numerous recombinant variants. Moreover, most of the cas genes evolve rapidly, complicating the family assignment for many Cas proteins and the use of family profiles for the recognition of CRISPR-Cas subtype signatures. Further progress in the comparative analysis of CRISPR-Cas systems requires integration of the most sensitive sequence comparison tools, protein structure comparison, and refined approaches for comparison of gene neighborhoods.

25981465	We have examined the processing of precursor-clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) RNAs (pre-crRNAs) of the Type I CRISPR-Cas system by incubation of radiolabeled model RNAs with recombinant CRISPR-associated (Cas) endoribonucleases, followed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) of the products. Determination of cleavage position is based on comparison with RNase T1 digestion and base hydrolysis products. The mechanism of cleavage is investigated by chemical and enzymatic characterization of the reaction products as well as by the demonstration that a specific 2'-deoxy substitution 5' to the scissile phosphate blocks endonucleolytic cleavage.

25981463	The development of deep sequencing technology has greatly facilitated transcriptome analyses of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), which is based on massively parallel sequencing of cDNAs, has been used to annotate transcript boundaries and revealed widespread antisense transcription as well as a wealth of novel noncoding transcripts in many bacteria. Moreover, RNA-seq is nowadays widely used for gene expression profiling and about to replace hybridization-based approaches such as microarrays. RNA-seq has also informed about the biogenesis and function of CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) of different types of bacterial RNA-based CRISPR-Cas immune systems. Here we describe several studies that employed RNA-seq for crRNA analyses, with a particular focus on a differential RNA-seq (dRNA-seq) approach, which can distinguish between primary and processed transcripts and allows for a genome-wide annotation of transcriptional start sites. This approach helped to identify a new crRNA biogenesis pathway of Type II CRISPR-Cas systems that involves a trans-encoded small RNA, tracrRNA, and the host factor RNase III.

25979474	The rapid development of CRISPR-Cas9 mediated genome editing techniques has given rise to a number of online and stand-alone tools to find and score CRISPR sites for whole genomes. Here we describe the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute Genome Editing database (WGE), which uses novel methods to compute, visualize and select optimal CRISPR sites in a genome browser environment. The WGE database currently stores single and paired CRISPR sites and pre-calculated off-target information for CRISPRs located in the mouse and human exomes. Scoring and display of off-target sites is simple, and intuitive, and filters can be applied to identify high-quality CRISPR sites rapidly. WGE also provides a tool for the design and display of gene targeting vectors in the same genome browser, along with gene models, protein translation and variation tracks. WGE is open, extensible and can be set up to compute and present CRISPR sites for any genome.

25968642	The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (CRISPR/Cas) system is an adaptive immune system present in many archaea and bacteria. CRISPR/Cas systems are incredibly diverse, and there is increasing evidence of CRISPR/Cas systems playing a role in cellular functions distinct from phage immunity. Previously, our laboratory reported one such alternate function in which the type 1-F CRISPR/Cas system of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain UCBPP-PA14 (abbreviated as P. aeruginosa PA14) inhibits both biofilm formation and swarming motility when the bacterium is lysogenized by the bacteriophage DMS3. In this study, we demonstrated that the presence of just the DMS3 protospacer and the protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) on the P. aeruginosa genome is necessary and sufficient for this CRISPR-dependent loss of these group behaviors, with no requirement of additional DMS3 sequences. We also demonstrated that the interaction of the CRISPR system with the DMS3 protospacer induces expression of SOS-regulated phage-related genes, including the well-characterized pyocin operon, through the activity of the nuclease Cas3 and subsequent RecA activation. Furthermore, our data suggest that expression of the phage-related genes results in bacterial cell death on a surface due to the inability of the CRISPR-engaged strain to downregulate phage-related gene expression, while these phage-related genes have minimal impact on growth and viability under planktonic conditions. Deletion of the phage-related genes restores biofilm formation and swarming motility while still maintaining a functional CRISPR/Cas system, demonstrating that the loss of these group behaviors is an indirect effect of CRISPR self-targeting.	The various CRISPR/Cas systems found in both archaea and bacteria are incredibly diverse, and advances in understanding the complex mechanisms of these varied systems has not only increased our knowledge of host-virus interplay but has also led to a major advancement in genetic engineering. Recently, increasing evidence suggested that bacteria can co-opt the CRISPR system for functions besides adaptive immunity to phage infection. This study examined one such alternative function, and this report describes the mechanism of type 1-F CRISPR-dependent loss of the biofilm and swarming in the medically relevant opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Since both biofilm formation and swarming motility are important in the virulence of P. aeruginosa, a full understanding of how the CRISPR system can regulate such group behaviors is fundamental to developing new therapeutics.

25965840	Propionibacterium acnes plays a central role in the pathogenesis of acne and is responsible for severe opportunistic infections. Numerous typing schemes have been developed that allow the identification of phylotypes, but they are often insufficient to differentiate subtypes. To better understand the genetic diversity of this species and to perform epidemiological analyses, high throughput discriminant genotyping techniques are needed. Here we describe the development of a multiple locus variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) analysis (MLVA) method. Thirteen VNTRs were identified in the genome of P. acnes and were used to genotype a collection of clinical isolates. In addition, publically available sequencing data for 102 genomes were analyzed in silico, providing an MLVA genotype. The clustering of MLVA data was in perfect congruence with whole genome based clustering. Analysis of the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) element uncovered new spacers, a supplementary source of genotypic information. The present MLVA13 scheme and associated internet database represents a first line genotyping assay to investigate large number of isolates. Particular strains may then be submitted to full genome sequencing in order to better analyze their pathogenic potential.	Y Hauck|C Soler|P Gérôme|R Vong|C Macnab|G Appere|G Vergnaud|C Pourcel

25959775	Immune systems must recognize and destroy different pathogens that threaten the host. CRISPR-Cas immune systems protect prokaryotes from viral and plasmid infection utilizing small CRISPR RNAs that are complementary to the invader's genome and specify the targets of RNA-guided Cas nucleases. Type III CRISPR-Cas immunity requires target transcription, and whereas genetic studies demonstrated DNA targeting, in vitro data have shown crRNA-guided RNA cleavage. The molecular mechanism behind these disparate activities is not known. Here, we show that transcription across the targets of the Staphylococcus epidermidis type III-A CRISPR-Cas system results in the cleavage of the target DNA and its transcripts, mediated by independent active sites within the Cas10-Csm ribonucleoprotein effector complex. Immunity against plasmids and DNA viruses requires DNA, but not RNA, cleavage activity. Our studies reveal a highly versatile mechanism of CRISPR immunity that can defend microorganisms against diverse DNA and RNA invaders.

25956682	The capability to modify the genome precisely and efficiently offers an extremely useful tool for biomedical research. Recent developments in genome editing technologies such as transcription activator-like effector nuclease and the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats system have made genome modification available for a number of organisms with relative ease. Here, we introduce these genome editing techniques, compare and contrast each technical approach and discuss their potential to study the underlying mechanisms of human disease using patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells.

25953352	The last couple of years have witnessed an explosion in development of CRISPR-based genome editing technologies in cell lines as well as in model organisms. In this review, we focus on the applications of this popular system in Drosophila. We discuss the effectiveness of the CRISPR/Cas9 systems in terms of delivery, mutagenesis detection, parameters affecting efficiency, and off-target issues, with an emphasis on how to apply this powerful tool to characterize gene functions.

25946192	Seventy four SNP genotypes and 54 E. coli genomes from kangaroo, Tasmanian devil, reptile, cattle, dog, horse, duck, bird, fish, rodent, human and environmental water sources were screened for the presence of the CRISPR 2.1 loci flanked by cas2 and iap genes. CRISPR 2.1 regions were found in 49% of the strains analysed. The majority of human E. coli isolates lacked the CRISPR 2.1 locus. We described 76 CRISPR 2.1 positive isolates originating from Australian animals and humans, which contained a total of 764 spacer sequences. CRISPR arrays demonstrated a long history of phage attacks especially in isolates from birds (up to 40 spacers). The most prevalent spacer (1.6%) was an ancient spacer found mainly in human, horse, duck, rodent, reptile and environmental water sources. The sequence of this spacer matched the intestinal P7 phage and the pO111 plasmid of E. coli.	MS Sheludchenko|F Huygens|H Stratton|M Hargreaves
25936245	This review discusses gene editing and its potential in oncology. Gene editing has not evolved faster towards clinical application because of its difficulty in implementation. There have been many limitations of the tools thought to be useful in therapeutic gene editing. However, recently the combinatorial use of multiple biological tools appears to have broken the barrier impending clinical development. This review gives a short primer on gene editing followed by some of the foundational work in gene editing and subsequently a discussion of programmable nucleases leading to a description of Zinc Finger Nuclease, TALENs and CRISPRs. Gene editing tools are now being used routinely to re-engineer the human genome. Theoretically, any gene or chromosomal sequence for which a targeting site can be identified could be rendered nonfunctional by the chromosomal breakage activity of Zinc Finger Nucleases, TALENs or a CRISPR/Cas9 system. Since the initial work started on the mechanism and regulation of gene editing, investigators have been searching for a way to develop these technologies as a treatment for cancer. The issue is finding a practical application of gene editing in oncology. However, progressive ideas are working their way through the research arena which may have an impact on cancer treatment.

25934548	Contagious equine metritis is a bacterial infectious disease of horses caused by Taylorella equigenitalis, a Gram-negative eubacterium. The disease has been described in several continents, including Europe, North America and Asia. A novel molecular method was developed to detect clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs), which were separated by non-repetitive unique spacer regions (NRUSRs) of similar length, in the Taylorella equigenitalis EQ59 strain using a primer pair, f-/r-TeCRISPR-ladder, by PCR amplification. In total, 31 Taylorella isolates (17 T. equigenitalis and 14 Taylorella asinigenitalis) were examined. The T. equigenitalis isolates came from thoroughbred and cold-blooded horses from nine countries during 1980-1996, whilst the T. asinigenitalis isolates all originated from donkey jacks in France and the USA during 1997-2006. PAGE fractionated all of the 13 CRISPRs separated by 12 NRUSRs in T. equigenitalis EQ59. Permutation examples of CRISPRs, which were separated by NRUSRs for small-sized ladders, consisting of two doublet bands were shown. Putative CRISPRs separated by NRUSRs were amplified with 14/17 (82.4 %) geographically disparate T. equigenitalis isolates using the newly designed primer pair. Approximately 82.4 % of the T. equigenitalis isolates had CRISPRs separated by NRUSRs. The CRISPR locus was also found in the French T. asinigenitalis strain MCE3. Putative CRISPRs separated by NRUSRs were detected similarly in 4/14 (28.6 %) T. asinigenitalis isolates. Overall, a more detailed understanding of the molecular biology of CRISPRs within Taylorella organisms may help elucidate the pathogenic virulence and transmission mechanisms associated with this important equine pathogen.

25922883	CRISPR/Cas9 technologies have been employed for genome editing to achieve gene knockouts and knock-ins in somatic cells. Similarly, certain endogenous genes have been tagged with fluorescent proteins. Often, the detection of tagged proteins requires high expression and sophisticated tools such as confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. Therefore, a simple, sensitive and robust transcriptional reporter system driven by endogenous promoter for studies into transcriptional regulation is desirable. We report a CRISPR/Cas9-based methodology for rapidly integrating a firefly luciferase gene in somatic cells under the control of endogenous promoter, using the TGFβ-responsive gene PAI-1. Our strategy employed a polycistronic cassette containing a non-fused GFP protein to ensure the detection of transgene delivery and rapid isolation of positive clones. We demonstrate that firefly luciferase cDNA can be efficiently delivered downstream of the promoter of the TGFβ-responsive gene PAI-1. Using chemical and genetic regulators of TGFβ signalling, we show that it mimics the transcriptional regulation of endogenous PAI-1 expression. Our unique approach has the potential to expedite studies on transcription of any gene in the context of its native chromatin landscape in somatic cells, allowing for robust high-throughput chemical and genetic screens.

25921071	In prokaryotes, Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-derived RNAs (crRNAs), together with CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins, capture and degrade invading genetic materials. In the type III-B CRISPR-Cas system, six Cas proteins (Cmr1-Cmr6) and a crRNA form an RNA silencing Cmr complex. Here we report the 2.1 Å crystal structure of the Cmr1-deficient, functional Cmr complex bound to single-stranded DNA, a substrate analog complementary to the crRNA guide. Cmr3 recognizes the crRNA 5' tag and defines the start position of the guide-target duplex, using its idiosyncratic loops. The β-hairpins of three Cmr4 subunits intercalate within the duplex, causing nucleotide displacements with 6 nt intervals, and thus periodically placing the scissile bonds near the crucial aspartate of Cmr4. The structure reveals the mechanism for specifying the periodic target cleavage sites from the crRNA 5' tag and provides insights into the assembly of the type III interference machineries and the evolution of the Cmr and Cascade complexes.

25918715	Recently, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) system has emerged as a powerful customizable artificial nuclease to facilitate precise genetic correction for tissue regeneration and isogenic disease modeling. However, previous studies reported substantial off-target activities of CRISPR system in human cells, and the enormous putative off-target sites are labor-intensive to be validated experimentally, thus motivating bioinformatics methods for rational design of CRISPR system and prediction of its potential off-target effects. Here, we describe an integrative analytical process to identify specific CRISPR target sites in the human β-globin gene (HBB) and predict their off-target effects. Our method includes off-target analysis in both coding and noncoding regions, which was neglected by previous studies. It was found that the CRISPR target sites in the introns have fewer off-target sites in the coding regions than those in the exons. Remarkably, target sites containing certain transcriptional factor motif have enriched binding sites of relevant transcriptional factor in their off-target sets. We also found that the intron sites have fewer SNPs, which leads to less variation of CRISPR efficiency in different individuals during clinical applications. Our studies provide a standard analytical procedure to select specific CRISPR targets for genetic correction.	Y Luo|D Zhu|Z Zhang|Y Chen|X Sun
25917878	Salivary gland secretion is altered in Drosophila embryos with loss of function of the sage gene. Saliva has a reduced volume and an increased electron density according to transmission electron microscopy, resulting in regions of tube dilation and constriction with intermittent tube closure. However, the precise functions of Bmsage in silkworm (Bombyx mori) are unknown, although its sequence had been deposited in SilkDB. From this, Bmsage is inferred to be a transcription factor that regulates the synthesis of silk fibroin and interacts with another silk gland-specific transcription factor, namely, silk gland factor-1. In this study, we introduced a germline mutation of Bmsage using the Cas9/sgRNA system, a genome-editing technology, resulting in deletion of Bmsage from the genome of B. mori. Of the 15 tested samples, seven displayed alterations at the target site. The mutagenesis efficiency was about 46.7% and there were no obvious off-target effects. In the screened homozygous mutants, silk glands developed poorly and the middle and posterior silk glands (MSG and PSG) were absent, which was significantly different from the wild type. The offspring of G0 mosaic silkworms had indel mutations causing 2- or 9-bp deletions at the target site, but exhibited the same abnormal silk gland structure. Mutant larvae containing different open-reading frames of Bmsage had the same silk gland phenotype. This illustrated that the mutant phenotype was due to Bmsage knockout. We conclude that Bmsage participates in embryonic development of the silk gland.	HH Xin|DP Zhang|RT Chen|ZZ Cai|Y Lu|S Liang|YG Miao
25914022	The interface between viruses and their hosts' are hot spots for biological and biotechnological innovation. Bacteria use restriction endonucleases to destroy invading DNA, and industry has exploited these enzymes for molecular cut-and-paste reactions that are central to many recombinant DNA technologies. Today, another class of nucleases central to adaptive immune systems that protect bacteria and archaea from invading viruses and plasmids are blazing a similar path from basic science to profound biomedical and industrial applications.

25908869	The ecological pressure that viruses place on microbial communities is not only based on predation, but also on gene transfer. In order to determine the potential impact of viruses and transduction, we need a better understanding of the dynamics of interactions between viruses and their hosts in the environment. Data on environmental viruses are scarce, and methods for tracking their interactions with prokaryotes are needed. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs), which contain viral sequences in bacterial genomes, might help document the history of virus-host interactions in the environment. In this study, a bioinformatics network linking viruses and their hosts using CRISPR sequences obtained from metagenomic data was developed and applied to metagenomes from Arctic glacial ice and soil. The application of our network approach showed that putative interactions were more commonly detected in the ice samples than the soil which would be consistent with the ice viral-bacterial interactions being more dynamic than those in soil. Further analysis of the viral sequences in the CRISPRs indicated that Ralstonia phages might be agents of transduction in the Arctic glacial ice.	L Sanguino|L Franqueville|TM Vogel|C Larose
25908821	An organism with a single recessive loss-of-function allele will typically have a wild-type phenotype, whereas individuals homozygous for two copies of the allele will display a mutant phenotype. We have developed a method called the mutagenic chain reaction (MCR), which is based on the CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing system for generating autocatalytic mutations, to produce homozygous loss-of-function mutations. In Drosophila, we found that MCR mutations efficiently spread from their chromosome of origin to the homologous chromosome, thereby converting heterozygous mutations to homozygosity in the vast majority of somatic and germline cells. MCR technology should have broad applications in diverse organisms.	VM Gantz|E Bier
25905628	The CRISPR/Cas9 system has emerged as an important tool in biomedical research for a wide range of applications, with significant potential for genome engineering and gene therapy. In order to achieve conditional control of the CRISPR/Cas9 system, a genetically encoded light-activated Cas9 was engineered through the site-specific installation of a caged lysine amino acid. Several potential lysine residues were identified as viable caging sites that can be modified to optically control Cas9 function, as demonstrated through optical activation and deactivation of both exogenous and endogenous gene function.

25904148	Hepatitis B virus (HBV) remains a global health threat as chronic HBV infection may lead to liver cirrhosis or cancer. Current antiviral therapies with nucleoside analogues can inhibit the replication of HBV, but do not disrupt the already existing HBV covalently closed circular DNA. The newly developed CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas9 (CRISPR-associated 9) system is a powerful tool to target cellular genome DNA for gene editing. In order to investigate the possibility of using the CRISPR/Cas9 system to disrupt the HBV DNA templates, we designed eight guide RNAs (gRNAs) that targeted the conserved regions of different HBV genotypes, which could significantly inhibit HBV replication both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the HBV-specific gRNA/Cas9 system could inhibit the replication of HBV of different genotypes in cells, and the viral DNA was significantly reduced by a single gRNA/Cas9 system and cleared by a combination of different gRNA/Cas9 systems.

25898893	Streptococcus uberis, a Gram-positive, catalase-negative member of the family Streptococcaceae is an important environmental pathogen responsible for a significant proportion of subclinical and clinical bovine intramammary infections. Currently, the genome of only a single reference strain (0140J) has been described. Here we present a comparative analysis of complete draft genome sequences of an additional twelve S. uberis strains.	Pan and core genome analysis revealed the core genome common to all strains to be 1,550 genes in 1,509 orthologous clusters, complemented by 115-246 accessory genes present in one or more S. uberis strains but absent in the reference strain 0140J. Most of the previously predicted virulent genes were present in the core genome of all 13 strains but gene gain/loss was observed between the isolates in CDS associated with clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs), prophage and bacteriocin production. Experimental challenge experiments confirmed strain EF20 as non-virulent; only able to infect in a transient manner that did not result in clinical mastitis. Comparison of the genome sequence of EF20 with the validated virulent strain 0140J identified genes associated with virulence, however these did not relate clearly with clinical/non-clinical status of infection.	The gain/loss of mobile genetic elements such as CRISPRs and prophage are a potential driving force for evolutionary change. This first "whole-genome" comparison of strains isolated from clinical vs non-clinical intramammary infections including the type virulent vs non-virulent strains did not identify simple gene gain/loss rules that readily explain, or be confidently associated with, differences in virulence. This suggests that a more complex dynamic determines infection potential and clinical outcome not simply gene content.	M Hossain|SA Egan|T Coffey|PN Ward|R Wilson|JA Leigh|RD Emes
25898104	Why are some defence mechanisms expressed constitutively, while others are induced only upon exposure?

25892259	Overexpression is a notorious concern in conventional and especially in super-resolution fluorescence light microscopy studies because it may cause numerous artifacts including ectopic sub-cellular localizations, erroneous formation of protein complexes, and others. Nonetheless, current live cell super-resolution microscopy studies generally rely on the overexpression of a host protein fused to a fluorescent protein. Here, we establish CRISPR/Cas9-mediated generation of heterozygous and homozygous human knockin cell lines expressing fluorescently tagged proteins from their respective native genomic loci at close to endogenous levels. We tagged three different proteins, exhibiting various localizations and expression levels, with the reversibly switchable fluorescent protein rsEGFP2. We demonstrate the benefit of endogenous expression levels compared to overexpression and show that typical overexpression-induced artefacts were avoided in genome-edited cells. Fluorescence activated cell sorting analysis revealed a narrow distribution of fusion protein expression levels in genome-edited cells, compared to a pronounced variability in transiently transfected cells. Using low light intensity RESOLFT (reversible saturable optical fluorescence transitions) nanoscopy we show sub-diffraction resolution imaging of living human knockin cells. Our strategy to generate human cell lines expressing fluorescent fusion proteins at endogenous levels for RESOLFT nanoscopy can be extended to other fluorescent tags and super-resolution approaches.

25891917	Streptococcus suis, an emerging infectious pathogen, is the cause of two large-scale outbreaks of human streptococcal toxic shock syndrome in China, and has attracted much attention from the scientific community. The genetic basis of its pathogenesis remains enigmatic, and no effective prevention measures have been established. To better understand the virulence differentiation of S. suis and develop a promising vaccine, we isolated and sequenced a native avirulent S. suis strain (05HAS68). Animal experiments revealed that 05HAS68 is an avirulent strain and could protect piglets from the attack of virulent strains. Comparative genomics analyses demonstrated the genetic basis for the lack of virulence in 05HAS68, which is characterized by the absence of some important virulence-associated factors and the intact 89K pathogenicity island. Lack of virulence was also illustrated by reduced survival of 05HAS68 compared to a virulent strain in pig whole blood. Further investigations revealed a large-scale genomic rearrangement in 05HAS68, which was proposed to be mediated by transposase genes and/or prophages. This genomic rearrangement may have caused the genomic diversity of S. suis, and resulted in biological discrepancies between 05HAS68 and highly virulent S. suis strains.

25885771	The success of Enterococcus faecium and E. faecalis evolving as multi-resistant nosocomial pathogens is associated with their ability to acquire and share adaptive traits, including antimicrobial resistance genes encoded by mobile genetic elements (MGEs). Here, we investigate this mobilome in successful hospital associated genetic lineages, E. faecium sequence type (ST)17 (n=10) and ST78 (n=10), E. faecalis ST6 (n=10) and ST40 (n=10) by DNA microarray analyses.	The hybridization patterns of 272 representative targets including plasmid backbones (n=85), transposable elements (n=85), resistance determinants (n=67), prophages (n=29) and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-cas sequences (n=6) separated the strains according to species, and for E. faecalis also according to STs. RCR-, Rep_3-, RepA_N- and Inc18-family plasmids were highly prevalent and with the exception of Rep_3, evenly distributed between the species. There was a considerable difference in the replicon profile, with rep 17/pRUM , rep 2/pRE25 , rep 14/EFNP1 and rep 20/pLG1 dominating in E. faecium and rep 9/pCF10 , rep 2/pRE25 and rep 7 in E. faecalis strains. We observed an overall high correlation between the presence and absence of genes coding for resistance towards antibiotics, metals, biocides and their corresponding MGEs as well as their phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility pattern. Although most IS families were represented in both E. faecalis and E. faecium, specific IS elements within these families were distributed in only one species. The prevalence of IS256-, IS3-, ISL3-, IS200/IS605-, IS110-, IS982- and IS4-transposases was significantly higher in E. faecium than E. faecalis, and that of IS110-, IS982- and IS1182-transposases in E. faecalis ST6 compared to ST40. Notably, the transposases of IS981, ISEfm1 and IS1678 that have only been reported in few enterococcal isolates were well represented in the E. faecium strains. E. faecalis ST40 strains harboured possible functional CRISPR-Cas systems, and still resistance and prophage sequences were generally well represented.	The targeted MGEs were highly prevalent among the selected STs, underlining their potential importance in the evolution of hospital-adapted lineages of enterococci. Although the propensity of inter-species horizontal gene transfer (HGT) must be emphasized, the considerable species-specificity of these MGEs indicates a separate vertical evolution of MGEs within each species, and for E. faecalis within each ST.

25880915	In the honeybee Apis mellifera, the bacterial gut community is consistently colonized by eight distinct phylotypes of bacteria. Managed bee colonies are of considerable economic interest and it is therefore important to elucidate the diversity and role of this microbiota in the honeybee. In this study, we have sequenced the genomes of eleven strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria isolated from the honey crop of the honeybee A. mellifera.	Single gene phylogenies confirmed that the isolated strains represent the diversity of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria in the gut, as previously identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Core genome phylogenies of the lactobacilli and bifidobacteria further indicated extensive divergence between strains classified as the same phylotype. Phylotype-specific protein families included unique surface proteins. Within phylotypes, we found a remarkably high level of gene content diversity. Carbohydrate metabolism and transport functions contributed up to 45% of the accessory genes, with some genomes having a higher content of genes encoding phosphotransferase systems for the uptake of carbohydrates than any previously sequenced genome. These genes were often located in highly variable genomic segments that also contained genes for enzymes involved in the degradation and modification of sugar residues. Strain-specific gene clusters for the biosynthesis of exopolysaccharides were identified in two phylotypes. The dynamics of these segments contrasted with low recombination frequencies and conserved gene order structures for the core genes. Hits for CRISPR spacers were almost exclusively found within phylotypes, suggesting that the phylotypes are associated with distinct phage populations.	The honeybee gut microbiota has been described as consisting of a modest number of phylotypes; however, the genomes sequenced in the current study demonstrated a very high level of gene content diversity within all three described phylotypes of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, particularly in terms of metabolic functions and surface structures, where many features were strain-specific. Together, these results indicate niche differentiation within phylotypes, suggesting that the honeybee gut microbiota is more complex than previously thought.

25874675	CRISPR-Cas (clustered, regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats coupled with CRISPR-associated proteins) is a bacterial immunity system that protects against invading phages or plasmids. In the process of CRISPR adaptation, short pieces of DNA ('spacers') are acquired from foreign elements and integrated into the CRISPR array. So far, it has remained a mystery how spacers are preferentially acquired from the foreign DNA while the self chromosome is avoided. Here we show that spacer acquisition is replication-dependent, and that DNA breaks formed at stalled replication forks promote spacer acquisition. Chromosomal hotspots of spacer acquisition were confined by Chi sites, which are sequence octamers highly enriched on the bacterial chromosome, suggesting that these sites limit spacer acquisition from self DNA. We further show that the avoidance of self is mediated by the RecBCD double-stranded DNA break repair complex. Our results suggest that, in Escherichia coli, acquisition of new spacers largely depends on RecBCD-mediated processing of double-stranded DNA breaks occurring primarily at replication forks, and that the preference for foreign DNA is achieved through the higher density of Chi sites on the self chromosome, in combination with the higher number of forks on the foreign DNA. This model explains the strong preference to acquire spacers both from high copy plasmids and from phages.	A Levy|MG Goren|I Yosef|O Auster|M Manor|G Amitai|R Edgar|U Qimron|R Sorek

25867216	The electroretinogram (ERG) is a noninvasive electrophysiological method for determining retinal function. Through the placement of an electrode on the surface of the cornea, electrical activity generated in response to light can be measured and used to assess the activity of retinal cells in vivo. This manuscript describes the use of the ERG to measure visual function in zebrafish. Zebrafish have long been utilized as a model for vertebrate development due to the ease of gene suppression by morpholino oligonucleotides and pharmacological manipulation. At 5-10 dpf, only cones are functional in the larval retina. Therefore, the zebrafish, unlike other animals, is a powerful model system for the study of cone visual function in vivo. This protocol uses standard anesthesia, micromanipulation and stereomicroscopy protocols that are common in laboratories that perform zebrafish research. The outlined methods make use of standard electrophysiology equipment and a low light camera to guide the placement of the recording microelectrode onto the larval cornea. Finally, we demonstrate how a commercially available ERG stimulator/recorder originally designed for use with mice can easily be adapted for use with zebrafish. ERG of larval zebrafish provides an excellent method of assaying cone visual function in animals that have been modified by morpholino oligonucleotide injection as well as newer genome engineering techniques such as Zinc Finger Nucleases (ZFNs), Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases (TALENs), and Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9, all of which have greatly increased the efficiency and efficacy of gene targeting in zebrafish. In addition, we take advantage of the ability of pharmacological agents to penetrate zebrafish larvae to evaluate the molecular components that contribute to the photoresponse. This protocol outlines a setup that can be modified and used by researchers with various experimental goals.	JD Chrispell|TI Rebrik|ER Weiss
25865334	The use of antiretroviral therapy has led to a significant decrease in morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected individuals. Nevertheless, gene-based therapies represent a promising therapeutic paradigm for HIV-1, as they have the potential for sustained viral inhibition and reduced treatment interventions. One new method amendable to a gene-based therapy is the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated protein-9 nuclease (Cas9) gene editing system.	CRISPR/Cas9 can be engineered to successfully modulate an array of disease-causing genetic elements. We discuss the diverse roles that CRISPR/Cas9 may play in targeting HIV and eradicating infection. The Cas9 nuclease coupled with one or more small guide RNAs can target the provirus to mediate excision of the integrated viral genome. Moreover, a modified nuclease-deficient Cas9 fused to transcription activation domains may induce targeted activation of proviral gene expression allowing for the purging of the latent reservoirs. These technologies can also be exploited to target host dependency factors such as the co-receptor CCR5, thus preventing cellular entry of the virus.	The diversity of the CRISPR/Cas9 technologies offers great promise for targeting different stages of the viral life cycle, and have the capacity for mediating an effective and sustained genetic therapy against HIV.

25859012	CRISPR/Cas9 has been used to genetically modify genomes in a variety of species, including non-human primates. Unfortunately, this new technology does cause mosaic mutations, and we do not yet know whether such mutations can functionally disrupt the targeted gene or cause the pathology seen in human disease. Addressing these issues is necessary if we are to generate large animal models of human diseases using CRISPR/Cas9. Here we used CRISPR/Cas9 to target the monkey dystrophin gene to create mutations that lead to Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a recessive X-linked form of muscular dystrophy. Examination of the relative targeting rate revealed that Crispr/Cas9 targeting could lead to mosaic mutations in up to 87% of the dystrophin alleles in monkey muscle. Moreover, CRISPR/Cas9 induced mutations in both male and female monkeys, with the markedly depleted dystrophin and muscle degeneration seen in early DMD. Our findings indicate that CRISPR/Cas9 can efficiently generate monkey models of human diseases, regardless of inheritance patterns. The presence of degenerated muscle cells in newborn Cas9-targeted monkeys suggests that therapeutic interventions at the early disease stage may be effective at alleviating the myopathy.

25858979	The integrated stress response (ISR) modulates messenger RNA translation to regulate the mammalian unfolded protein response (UPR), immunity, and memory formation. A chemical ISR inhibitor, ISRIB, enhances cognitive function and modulates the UPR in vivo. To explore mechanisms involved in ISRIB action, we screened cultured mammalian cells for somatic mutations that reversed its effect on the ISR. Clustered missense mutations were found at the amino-terminal portion of the delta subunit of guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) eIF2B. When reintroduced by CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing of wild-type cells, these mutations reversed both ISRIB-mediated inhibition of the ISR and its stimulatory effect on eIF2B GEF activity toward its substrate, the translation initiation factor eIF2, in vitro. Thus, ISRIB targets an interaction between eIF2 and eIF2B that lies at the core of the ISR.	Y Sekine|A Zyryanova|A Crespillo-Casado|PM Fischer|HP Harding|D Ron
25856577	Although several site-speciﬁc nucleases (SSNs), such as zinc-ﬁnger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas, have emerged as powerful tools for targeted gene editing in many organisms, to date, gene targeting (GT) in plants remains a formidable challenge. In the present study, we attempted to substitute a single base in situ on the rice OsEPSPS gene by co-transformation of TALEN with chimeric RNA/DNA oligonucleotides (COs), including different strand composition such as RNA/DNA (C1) or DNA/RNA (C2) but contained the same target base to be substituted. In contrast to zero GT event obtained by the co-transformation of TALEN with homologous recombination plasmid (HRP), we obtained one mutant showing target base substitution although accompanied by undesired deletion of 12 bases downstream the target site from the co-transformation of TALEN and C1. In addition to this typical event, we also obtained 16 mutants with different length of base deletions around the target site among 105 calli lines derived from transformation of TALEN alone (4/19) as well as co-transformation of TELAN with either HRP (5/30) or C1 (2/25) or C2 (5/31). Further analysis demonstrated that the homozygous gene-edited mutants without foreign gene insertion could be obtained in one generation. The induced mutations in transgenic generation were also capable to pass to the next generation stably. However, the genotypes of mutants did not segregate normally in T1 population, probably due to lethal mutations. Phenotypic assessments in T1 generation showed that the heterozygous plants with either one or three bases deletion on target sequence, called d1 and d3, were more sensitive to glyphosate and the heterozygous d1 plants had significantly lower seed-setting rate than wild-type.

25849986	To identify chromatin mechanisms of neuronal differentiation, we characterized chromatin accessibility and gene expression in cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) of the developing mouse. We used DNase-seq to map accessibility of cis-regulatory elements and RNA-seq to profile transcript abundance across postnatal stages of neuronal differentiation in vivo and in culture. We observed thousands of chromatin accessibility changes as CGNs differentiated, and verified, using H3K27ac ChIP-seq, reporter gene assays and CRISPR-mediated activation, that many of these regions function as neuronal enhancers. Motif discovery in differentially accessible chromatin regions suggested a previously unknown role for the Zic family of transcription factors in CGN maturation. We confirmed the association of Zic with these elements by ChIP-seq and found, using knockdown, that Zic1 and Zic2 are required for coordinating mature neuronal gene expression patterns. Together, our data reveal chromatin dynamics at thousands of gene regulatory elements that facilitate the gene expression patterns necessary for neuronal differentiation and function.

25848871	The viral population, including bacteriophages, is an important component of the human microbiota, yet is poorly understood. We aim to determine whether bacteriophages modulate the composition of the bacterial populations, thus potentially playing a role in health or disease. We investigated the diversity and host interactions of the bacteriophages of Propionibacterium acnes, a major human skin commensal implicated in acne pathogenesis. By sequencing 48 P. acnes phages isolated from acne patients and healthy individuals and by analyzing the P. acnes phage populations in healthy skin metagenomes, we revealed that P. acnes phage populations in the skin microbial community are often dominated by one strain. We also found phage strains shared among both related and unrelated individuals, suggesting that a pool of common phages exists in the human population and that transmission of phages may occur between individuals. To better understand the bacterium-phage interactions in the skin microbiota, we determined the outcomes of 74 genetically defined Propionibacterium strains challenged by 15 sequenced phages. Depending on the Propionibacterium lineage, phage infection can result in lysis, pseudolysogeny, or resistance. In type II P. acnes strains, we found that encoding matching clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat spacers is insufficient to confer phage resistance. Overall, our findings suggest that the prey-predator relationship between bacteria and phages may have a role in modulating the composition of the microbiota. Our study also suggests that the microbiome structure of an individual may be an important factor in the design of phage-based therapy.

25839984	Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) strains, including those of O157:H7 and the "big six" serogroups (i.e., O26, O45, O103, O111, O121, and O145) are food-borne pathogens that pose a serious health threat to humans. Ruminants, especially cattle, are a major reservoir for O157 and non-O157 STEC. In the present study, 115 E. coli strains isolated from small and very small beef processing plants were screened for virulence genes (stx1, stx2, eae) using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Thirteen (11.3%) of the 115 isolates tested positive for stx1, stx2, or eae genes, but only 4 (3.5%) tested positive for either stx1 or stx2. A multiplex PCR reaction targeting eight O-serogroups (O26, O45, O103, O111, O113, O121, O145, O157) identified 12 isolates as O26, O103, O111, or O145, with E. coli O26 being the most predominant serogroup (61.5%). The thirteen isolates were further analyzed using Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) subtyping. Consistent with previous studies, CRISPR alleles from strains of the same serogroup were similar in their spacer content and order, regardless of the isolation source. A completely different CRISPR allele was observed in one isolate ("7-J") which exhibited a different O-serogroup (O78). Our results confirmed previous findings that CRISPR loci are conserved among phylogenetically-related strains. In addition, 8 E. coli O26 isolates and a collection of 42 E. coli O26 isolates were screened for 12 enterohemorrhagic E. coli-specific genes. Seven genes (ECs848-Hypothetical Protein, ECs2226-Hypothetical Protein, ECs3857-nleB, ECs3858-Hypothetical Protein, ECs4552-escF, ECs4553-Hypothetical Protein, and ECs4557-sepL) were found in all 50 isolates. An additional 5 genes (ECs1322-ureA urease subunit γ, ECs1323-ureB urease subunit β, ECs1326-ureF, ECs1561-Hypothetical Protein, and ECs1568-Hypothetical Protein) were found to be highly prevalent in isolates from human sources, while lower in isolates from beef processing plants, cattle, and other sources. This finding indicates the possible role of these genes in virulence of human O26 strains.	Y Jiang|S Yin|EG Dudley|CN Cutter
25837515	Adaptive immunity in bacteria involves RNA-guided surveillance complexes that use CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-associated (Cas) proteins together with CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) to target invasive nucleic acids for degradation. Whereas type I and type II CRISPR-Cas surveillance complexes target double-stranded DNA, type III complexes target single-stranded RNA. Near-atomic resolution cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions of native type III Cmr (CRISPR RAMP module) complexes in the absence and presence of target RNA reveal a helical protein arrangement that positions the crRNA for substrate binding. Thumblike β hairpins intercalate between segments of duplexed crRNA:target RNA to facilitate cleavage of the target at 6-nucleotide intervals. The Cmr complex is architecturally similar to the type I CRISPR-Cascade complex, suggesting divergent evolution of these immune systems from a common ancestor.

25831520	Paraspeckles are subnuclear structures that form around nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 (NEAT1) long noncoding RNA (lncRNA). Recently, paraspeckles were shown to be functional nuclear bodies involved in stress responses and the development of specific organs. Paraspeckle formation is initiated by transcription of the NEAT1 chromosomal locus and proceeds in conjunction with NEAT1 lncRNA biogenesis and a subsequent assembly step involving >40 paraspeckle proteins (PSPs). In this study, subunits of SWItch/Sucrose NonFermentable (SWI/SNF) chromatin-remodeling complexes were identified as paraspeckle components that interact with PSPs and NEAT1 lncRNA. EM observations revealed that SWI/SNF complexes were enriched in paraspeckle subdomains depleted of chromatin. Knockdown of SWI/SNF components resulted in paraspeckle disintegration, but mutation of the ATPase domain of the catalytic subunit BRG1 did not affect paraspeckle integrity, indicating that the essential role of SWI/SNF complexes in paraspeckle formation does not require their canonical activity. Knockdown of SWI/SNF complexes barely affected the levels of known essential paraspeckle components, but markedly diminished the interactions between essential PSPs, suggesting that SWI/SNF complexes facilitate organization of the PSP interaction network required for intact paraspeckle assembly. The interactions between SWI/SNF components and essential PSPs were maintained in NEAT1-depleted cells, suggesting that SWI/SNF complexes not only facilitate interactions between PSPs, but also recruit PSPs during paraspeckle assembly. SWI/SNF complexes were also required for Satellite III lncRNA-dependent formation of nuclear stress bodies under heat-shock conditions. Our data suggest the existence of a common mechanism underlying the formation of lncRNA-dependent nuclear body architectures in mammalian cells.

25827874	Isolation of specific genomic regions retaining molecular interactions is necessary for their biochemical analysis. Here, we describe engineered DNA-binding molecule-mediated chromatin immunoprecipitation (enChIP) using the CRISPR system, for purification of specific genomic regions retaining molecular interactions. In this form of enChIP, specific genomic regions are immunoprecipitated with antibody against a tag(s), which is fused to a catalytically inactive form of Cas9 (dCas9), which is co-expressed with a guide RNA (gRNA) and recognizes endogenous DNA sequence in the genomic regions of interest. enChIP combined with mass spectrometry (enChIP-MS), next-generation sequencing (enChIP-Seq), and RNA-Seq (enChIP-RNA-Seq) can identify proteins, other genomic regions, and RNA, respectively, that interact with the target genomic region.

25827422	We investigated the interaction between Sulfolobus spindle-shaped virus (SSV9) and its native archaeal host Sulfolobus islandicus. We show that upon exposure to SSV9, S. islandicus strain RJW002 has a significant growth delay where the majority of cells are dormant (viable but not growing) for 24 to 48 hours postinfection (hpi) compared to the growth of controls without virus. We demonstrate that in this system, dormancy (i) is induced by both active and inactive virus particles at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI), (ii) is reversible in strains with active CRISPR-Cas immunity that prevents the establishment of productive infections, and (iii) results in dramatic and rapid host death if virus persists in the culture even at low levels. Our results add a new dimension to evolutionary models of virus-host interactions, showing that the mere presence of a virus induces host cell stasis and death independent of infection. This novel, highly sensitive, and risky bet-hedging antiviral response must be integrated into models of virus-host interactions in this system so that the true ecological impact of viruses can be predicted and understood.	Viruses of microbes play key roles in microbial ecology; however, our understanding of viral impact on host physiology is based on a few model bacteria that represent a small fraction of the life history strategies employed by hosts or viruses across the three domains that encompass the microbial world. We have demonstrated that rare and even inactive viruses induce dormancy in the model archaeon S. islandicus. Similar virus-induced dormancy strategies in other microbial systems may help to explain several confounding observations in other systems, including the surprising abundance of dormant cell types found in many microbial environments, the difficulty of culturing microorganisms in the laboratory, and the paradoxical virus-to-host abundances that do not match model predictions. A more accurate grasp of virus-host interactions will expand our understanding of the impact of viruses in microbial ecology.	MA Bautista|C Zhang|RJ Whitaker
25827103	CRISPR/Cas is a microbial adaptive immune system that uses RNA-guided nucleases to cleave foreign genetic elements. The CRISPR/Cas9 method has been engineered from the type II prokaryotic CRISPR system and uses a single-guide RNA to target the Cas9 nuclease to a specific genomic sequence. Cas9 induces double-stranded DNA breaks which are repaired either by imperfect non-homologous end joining to generate insertions or deletions (indels) or, if a repair template is provided, by homology-directed repair. Due to its specificity, simplicity and versatility, the CRISPR/Cas9 system has recently emerged as a powerful tool for genome engineering in various species. This technology can be used to investigate the function of a gene of interest or to correct gene mutations in cells via genome editing, paving the way for future gene therapy approaches. Improvements to the efficiency of CRISPR repair, in particular to increase the rate of gene correction and to reduce undesired off-target effects, and the development of more effective delivery methods will be required for its broad therapeutic application.

25822415	Programmable control over an addressable global regulator would enable simultaneous repression of multiple genes and would have tremendous impact on the field of synthetic biology. It has recently been established that CRISPR/Cas systems can be engineered to repress gene transcription at nearly any desired location in a sequence-specific manner, but there remain only a handful of applications described to date. In this work, we report development of a vector possessing a CRISPathBrick feature, enabling rapid modular assembly of natural type II-A CRISPR arrays capable of simultaneously repressing multiple target genes in Escherichia coli. Iterative incorporation of spacers into this CRISPathBrick feature facilitates the combinatorial construction of arrays, from a small number of DNA parts, which can be utilized to generate a suite of complex phenotypes corresponding to an encoded genetic program. We show that CRISPathBrick can be used to tune expression of plasmid-based genes and repress chromosomal targets in probiotic, virulent, and commonly engineered E. coli strains. Furthermore, we describe development of pCRISPReporter, a fluorescent reporter plasmid utilized to quantify dCas9-mediated repression from endogenous promoters. Finally, we demonstrate that dCas9-mediated repression can be harnessed to assess the effect of downregulating both novel and computationally predicted metabolic engineering targets, improving the yield of a heterologous phytochemical through repression of endogenous genes. These tools provide a platform for rapid evaluation of multiplex metabolic engineering interventions.

25807262	Clinical organ allotransplantation is limited by the availability of deceased human donors. However, the transplantation of human organs produced in other species would provide an unlimited number of organs. The pig has been identified as the most suitable source of organs for humans as organs of any size would be available. Genome editing by RNA-guided endonucleases, also known as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR/Cas9), in combination with induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), may have the potential to enable the creation of human organs from genetically-modified chimaeric pigs. These could potentially provide an unlimited supply of organs that would not be rejected by the recipient's immune system. However, substantial research is needed to prove that this approach will work. Genetic modification of chimaeric pigs could also provide useful models for developing therapies for various human diseases, especially in relation to drug development.

25806970	Bacteria of the order Actinomycetales are one of the most important sources of pharmacologically active and industrially relevant secondary metabolites. Unfortunately, many of them are still recalcitrant to genetic manipulation, which is a bottleneck for systematic metabolic engineering. To facilitate the genetic manipulation of actinomycetes, we developed a highly efficient CRISPR-Cas9 system to delete gene(s) or gene cluster(s), implement precise gene replacements, and reversibly control gene expression in actinomycetes. We demonstrate our system by targeting two genes, actIORF1 (SCO5087) and actVB (SCO5092), from the actinorhodin biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2). Our CRISPR-Cas9 system successfully inactivated the targeted genes. When no templates for homology-directed repair (HDR) were present, the site-specific DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) introduced by Cas9 were repaired through the error-prone nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway, resulting in a library of deletions with variable sizes around the targeted sequence. If templates for HDR were provided at the same time, precise deletions of the targeted gene were observed with near 100% frequency. Moreover, we developed a system to efficiently and reversibly control expression of target genes, deemed CRISPRi, based on a catalytically dead variant of Cas9 (dCas9). The CRISPR-Cas9 based system described here comprises a powerful and broadly applicable set of tools to manipulate actinomycetal genomes.	Y Tong|P Charusanti|L Zhang|T Weber|SY Lee
25800748	The discovery that the machinery of the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 bacterial immune system can be re-purposed to easily create deletions, insertions and replacements in the mammalian genome has revolutionized the field of genome engineering and re-invigorated the field of gene therapy. Many parallels have been drawn between the newly discovered CRISPR-Cas9 system and the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway in terms of their utility for understanding and interrogating gene function in mammalian cells. Given this similarity, the CRISPR-Cas9 field stands to benefit immensely from lessons learned during the development of RNAi technology. We examine how the history of RNAi can inform today's challenges in CRISPR-Cas9 genome engineering such as efficiency, specificity, high-throughput screening and delivery for in vivo and therapeutic applications.

25781611	Homologous recombination (HR) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been harnessed for both plasmid construction and chromosomal integration of foreign DNA. Still, native HR machinery is not efficient enough for complex and marker-free genome engineering required for modern metabolic engineering. Here, we present a method for marker-free multiloci integration of in vivo assembled DNA parts. By the use of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated one-step double-strand breaks at single, double and triple integration sites we report the successful in vivo assembly and chromosomal integration of DNA parts. We call our method CasEMBLR and validate its applicability for genome engineering and cell factory development in two ways: (i) introduction of the carotenoid pathway from 15 DNA parts into three targeted loci, and (ii) creation of a tyrosine production strain using ten parts into two loci, simultaneously knocking out two genes. This method complements and improves the current set of tools available for genome engineering in S. cerevisiae.

25778918	Cilium formation and maintenance require intraflagellar transport (IFT). Although much is known about kinesin-2-driven anterograde IFT, the composition and regulation of retrograde IFT-specific dynein remain elusive. Components of cytoplasmic dynein may participate in IFT; however, their essential roles in cell division preclude functional studies in postmitotic cilia. Here, we report that inducible expression of the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 system in Caenorhabditis elegans generated conditional mutations in IFT motors and particles, recapitulating ciliary defects in their null mutants. Using this method to bypass the embryonic requirement, we show the following: the dynein intermediate chain, light chain LC8, and lissencephaly-1 regulate retrograde IFT; the dynein light intermediate chain functions in dendrites and indirectly contributes to ciliogenesis; and the Tctex and Roadblock light chains are dispensable for cilium assembly. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these components undergo biphasic IFT with distinct transport frequencies and turnaround behaviors. Together, our results suggest that IFT-dynein and cytoplasmic dynein have unique compositions but also share components and regulatory mechanisms.	W Li|P Yi|G Ou
25775608	Conventional control strategies for mosquito-borne pathogens such as malaria and dengue are now being complemented by the development of transgenic mosquito strains reprogrammed to generate beneficial phenotypes such as conditional sterility or pathogen resistance. The widespread success of site-specific nucleases such as transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 in model organisms also suggests that reprogrammable gene drive systems based on these nucleases may be capable of spreading such beneficial phenotypes in wild mosquito populations. Using the mosquito Aedes aegypti, we determined that mutations in the FokI domain used in TALENs to generate obligate heterodimeric complexes substantially and significantly reduce gene editing rates. We found that CRISPR/Cas9-based editing in the mosquito Ae. aegypti is also highly variable, with the majority of guide RNAs unable to generate detectable editing. By first evaluating candidate guide RNAs using a transient embryo assay, we were able to rapidly identify highly effective guide RNAs; focusing germ line-based experiments only on this cohort resulted in consistently high editing rates of 24-90%. Microinjection of double-stranded RNAs targeting ku70 or lig4, both essential components of the end-joining response, increased recombination-based repair in early embryos as determined by plasmid-based reporters. RNAi-based suppression of Ku70 concurrent with embryonic microinjection of site-specific nucleases yielded consistent gene insertion frequencies of 2-3%, similar to traditional transposon- or ΦC31-based integration methods but without the requirement for an initial docking step. These studies should greatly accelerate investigations into mosquito biology, streamline development of transgenic strains for field releases, and simplify the evaluation of novel Cas9-based gene drive systems.

25772450	In the face of infectious disease, organisms evolved a range of defense mechanisms, with a clear distinction between those that are constitutive (always active) and those that are inducible (elicited by parasites). Both defense strategies have evolved from each other, but we lack an understanding of the conditions that favor one strategy over the other. While it is hard to generalize about their degree of protection, it is possible to make generalizations about their associated fitness costs, which are commonly detected. By definition, constitutive defenses are always "on," and are therefore associated with a fixed cost, independent of parasite exposure. Inducible defenses, on the other hand, may lack costs in the absence of parasites but become costly when defense is elicited through processes such as immunopathology. Bacteria can evolve constitutive defense against phage by modification/masking of surface receptors, which is often associated with reduced fitness in the absence of phage. Bacteria can also evolve inducible defense using the CRISPR-Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat, CRISPR associated) immune system, which is typically elicited upon infection. CRISPR-Cas functions by integrating phage sequences into CRISPR loci on the host genome. Upon re-infection, CRISPR transcripts guide cleavage of phage genomes. In nature, both mechanisms are important. Using a general theoretical model and experimental evolution, we tease apart the mechanism that drives their evolution and show that infection risk determines the relative investment in the two arms of defense.

25762293	CRISPR/Cas9, originally discovered as a bacterial immune system, has recently been engineered into the latest tool to successfully introduce site-specific mutations in a variety of different organisms. Composed only of the Cas9 protein as well as one engineered guide RNA for its functionality, this system is much less complex in its setup and easier to handle than other guided nucleases such as Zinc-finger nucleases or TALENs.Here, we describe the simultaneous transfection of two paired CRISPR sgRNAs-Cas9 plasmids, in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), resulting in the knockout of the selected target gene. Together with a four primer-evaluation system, it poses an efficient way to generate new independent knockout mouse embryonic stem cell lines.	R Wettstein|M Bodak|C Ciaudo
25759478	Amino acid deprivation promotes the inhibition of the kinase complex mTORC1 (mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1) and activation of the kinase GCN2 (general control nonrepressed 2). Signaling pathways downstream of both kinases have been thought to independently induce autophagy. We showed that these two amino acid-sensing systems are linked. We showed that pharmacological inhibition of mTORC1 led to activation of GCN2 and phosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) in a mechanism dependent on the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 6 (PP6C). Autophagy induced by pharmacological inhibition of mTORC1 required PP6C, GCN2, and eIF2α phosphorylation. Although some of the PP6C mutants found in melanoma did not form a strong complex with PP6 regulatory subunits and were rapidly degraded, these mutants paradoxically stabilized PP6C encoded by the wild-type allele and increased eIF2α phosphorylation. Furthermore, these PP6C mutations were associated with increased autophagy in vitro and in human melanoma samples. Thus, these data showed that GCN2 activation and phosphorylation of eIF2α in response to mTORC1 inhibition are necessary for autophagy. Additionally, we described a role for PP6C in this process and provided a mechanism for PP6C mutations associated with melanoma.	J Wengrod|D Wang|S Weiss|H Zhong|I Osman|LB Gardner
25759096	CRISPR/Cas systems mediate bacterial adaptive immune responses that evolved to protect bacteria from bacteriophage and other horizontally transmitted genetic elements. Several CRISPR/Cas systems exist but the simplest variant, referred to as Type II, has a single effector DNA endonuclease, called Cas9, which is guided to its viral DNA target by two small RNAs, the crRNA and the tracrRNA. Initial efforts to adapt the CRISPR/Cas system for DNA editing in mammalian cells, which focused on the Cas9 protein from Streptococcus pyogenes (Spy), demonstrated that Spy Cas9 can be directed to DNA targets in mammalian cells by tracrRNA:crRNA fusion transcripts called single guide RNAs (sgRNA). Upon binding, Cas9 induces DNA cleavage leading to mutagenesis as a result of error prone non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). Recently, the Spy Cas9 system has been adapted for high throughput screening of genes in human cells for their relevance to a particular phenotype and, more generally, for the targeted inactivation of specific genes, in cell lines and in vivo in a number of model organisms. The latter aim seems likely to be greatly enhanced by the recent development of Cas9 proteins from bacterial species such as Neisseria meningitidis and Staphyloccus aureus that are small enough to be expressed using adeno-associated (AAV)-based vectors that can be readily prepared at very high titers. The evolving Cas9-based DNA editing systems therefore appear likely to not only impact virology by allowing researchers to screen for human genes that affect the replication of pathogenic human viruses of all types but also to derive clonal human cell lines that lack individual gene products that either facilitate or restrict viral replication. Moreover, high titer AAV-based vectors offer the possibility of directly targeting DNA viruses that infect discrete sites in the human body, such as herpes simplex virus and hepatitis B virus, with the hope that the entire population of viral DNA genomes might be destroyed. In conclusion, we believe that the continued rapid evolution of CRISPR/Cas technology will soon have a major, possibly revolutionary, impact on the field of virology.	EM Kennedy|BR Cullen
25752963	CRISPR/Cas9 technology of genome editing has greatly facilitated the targeted inactivation of genes in vitro and in vivo in a wide range of organisms. In zebrafish, it allows the rapid generation of knockout lines by simply injecting a guide RNA (gRNA) and Cas9 mRNA into one-cell stage embryos. Here, we report a simple and scalable CRISPR-based vector system for tissue-specific gene inactivation in zebrafish. As proof of principle, we used our vector with the gata1 promoter driving Cas9 expression to silence the urod gene, implicated in heme biosynthesis, specifically in the erythrocytic lineage. Urod targeting yielded red fluorescent erythrocytes in zebrafish embryos, recapitulating the phenotype observed in the yquem mutant. While F0 embryos displayed mosaic gene disruption, the phenotype appeared very penetrant in stable F1 fish. This vector system constitutes a unique tool to spatially control gene knockout and greatly broadens the scope of loss-of-function studies in zebrafish.	J Ablain|EM Durand|S Yang|Y Zhou|LI Zon
25752578	Small RNA-guided protein complexes play an essential role in CRISPR-mediated immunity in prokaryotes. While these complexes initiate interference by flagging cognate invader DNA for destruction, recent evidence has implicated their involvement in new CRISPR memory formation, called priming, against mutated invader sequences. The mechanism by which the target recognition complex mediates these disparate responses-interference and priming-remains poorly understood. Using single-molecule FRET, we visualize how bona fide and mutated targets are differentially probed by E. coli Cascade. We observe that the recognition of bona fide targets is an ordered process that is tightly controlled for high fidelity. Mutated targets are recognized with low fidelity, which is featured by short-lived and PAM- and seed-independent binding by any segment of the crRNA. These dual roles of Cascade in immunity with distinct fidelities underpin CRISPR-Cas robustness, allowing for efficient degradation of bona fide targets and priming of mutated DNA targets.

25752143	To investigate the polymorphism of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) in Bacillu santhracis and the application to molecular typing based on the polymorphism of CRISPR in B. anthracis.	We downloaded the whole genome sequence of 6 B. anthracis strains and extracted the CRISPR sites. We designed the primers of CRISPR sites and amplified the CRISPR fragments in 193 B. anthracis strains by PCR and sequenced these fragments. In order to reveal the polymorphism of CRISPR in B. anthracis, wealigned all the extracted sequences and sequenced results by local blasting. At the same time, we also analyzed the CRISPR sites in B. cereus and B. thuringiensis.	We did not find any polymorphism of CRISPR in B. anthracis.	The molecular typing approach based on CRISPR polymorphism is not suitable for B. anthracis, but it is possible for us to distinguish B. anthracis from B. cereus and B. thuringiensis.

25751063	Here, we describe the multiple lentiviral expression (MuLE) system that allows multiple genetic alterations to be introduced simultaneously into mammalian cells. We created a toolbox of MuLE vectors that constitute a flexible, modular system for the rapid engineering of complex polycistronic lentiviruses, allowing combinatorial gene overexpression, gene knockdown, Cre-mediated gene deletion, or CRISPR/Cas9-mediated (where CRISPR indicates clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) gene mutation, together with expression of fluorescent or enzymatic reporters for cellular assays and animal imaging. Examples of tumor engineering were used to illustrate the speed and versatility of performing combinatorial genetics using the MuLE system. By transducing cultured primary mouse cells with single MuLE lentiviruses, we engineered tumors containing up to 5 different genetic alterations, identified genetic dependencies of molecularly defined tumors, conducted genetic interaction screens, and induced the simultaneous CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of 3 tumor-suppressor genes. Intramuscular injection of MuLE viruses expressing oncogenic H-RasG12V together with combinations of knockdowns of the tumor suppressors cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (Cdkn2a), transformation-related protein 53 (Trp53), and phosphatase and tensin homolog (Pten) allowed the generation of 3 murine sarcoma models, demonstrating that genetically defined autochthonous tumors can be rapidly generated and quantitatively monitored via direct injection of polycistronic MuLE lentiviruses into mouse tissues. Together, our results demonstrate that the MuLE system provides genetic power for the systematic investigation of the molecular mechanisms that underlie human diseases.

Here, we report a simple CRISPR array assembling method which will facilitate multiplex targeting usage. First, the Streptococcus thermophilus CRISPR3/Cas locus was cloned. Second, different CRISPR arrays were assembled with different crRNA spacers. Transformation assays using different Escherichia coli strains demonstrated efficient plasmid DNA targeting, and we achieved targeting efficiency up to 95% with an assembled CRISPR array with three crRNA spacers.

25748060	The natural history of tuberculosis may be tackled by various means, among which the record of molecular scars that have been registered by the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) genomes transmitted from patient to patient for tens of thousands years and possibly more. Recently discovered polymorphic loci, the CRISPR sequences, are indirect witnesses of the historical phage-bacteria struggle, and may be related to the time when the ancestor of today's tubercle bacilli were environmental bacteria, i.e. before becoming intracellular parasites. In this article, we present what are CRISPRs and try to summarize almost 20 years of research results obtained using the genetic diversity of the CRISPR loci in MTBC as a perspective for studying new models. We show that the study of the diversity of CRISPR sequences, thanks to «spoligotyping», has played a great role in our global understanding of the population structure of MTBC.	C Sola
25747007	The vinegar fly, Drosophila melanogaster, has been used to identify and manipulate insecticide resistance genes. The advancement of genome engineering technology and the increasing availability of pest genome sequences has increased the predictive and diagnostic capacity of the Drosophila model. The Drosophila model can be extended to investigate the basic biology of the interaction between insecticides and the proteins they target. Recently we have developed an in vivo system that permits the expression and study of key insecticide targets, the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), in controlled genetic backgrounds. Here this system is used to study the interaction between the insecticide spinosad and a nAChR subunit, Dα6. Reciprocal chimeric subunits were created from Dα6 and Dα7, a subunit that does not respond to spinosad. Using the in vivo system, the Dα6/Dα7 chimeric subunits were tested for their capacity to respond to spinosad. Only the subunits containing the C-terminal region of Dα6 were able to respond to spinosad, thus confirming the importance this region for spinosad binding. A new incompletely dominant, spinosad resistance mechanism that may evolve in pest species is also examined. First generated using chemical mutagenesis, the Dα6(P146S) mutation was recreated using the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 system, the first use of this technology to introduce a resistant mutation into a controlled genetic background. Both alleles present with the same incompletely dominant, spinosad resistance phenotype, proving the P146S replacement to be the causal mutation. The proximity of the P146S mutation to the conserved Cys-loop indicates that it may impair the gating of the receptor. The results of this study enhance the understanding of nAChR structure:function relationships.	J Somers|J Nguyen|C Lumb|P Batterham|T Perry
25746010	The hepatitis C virus (HCV) is one of the leading causes of chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinomas and infects approximately 170 million people worldwide. Although several reporter systems have been developed, many shortcomings limit their use in the assessment of HCV infections. Here, we report a real-time live-cell reporter, termed the NIrD (NS3-4A Inducible rtTA-mediated Dual-reporter) system, which provides an on-off switch specifically in response to an HCV infection. Using the NIrD system and a focused CRISPR/Cas9 library, we identified CLDN1, OCLN and CD81 as essential genes for both the cell-free entry and the cell-to-cell transmission of HCV. The combination of this ultra-sensitive reporter system and the CRISPR knockout screening provides a powerful and high-throughput strategy for the identification of critical host components for HCV infections.

25742428	Genome engineering has been revolutionized by the discovery of clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated system genes (Cas) in bacteria. The type IIB Streptococcus pyogenes CRISPR/Cas9 system functions in many species and additional types of CRISPR/Cas systems are under development. In the type II system, expression of CRISPR single guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting a defined sequence and Cas9 generates a sequence-specific nuclease inducing small deletions or insertions. Moreover, knock-in of large DNA inserts has been shown at the sites targeted by sgRNAs and Cas9. Several tools are available for designing sgRNAs that target unique locations in the genome. However, the ability to find sgRNA targets common to several similar sequences or, by contrast, unique to each of these sequences, would also be advantageous. To provide such a tool for several types of CRISPR/Cas system and many species, we developed the CRISPR MultiTargeter software. Similar DNA sequences in question are duplicated genes and sets of exons of different transcripts of a gene. Thus, we implemented a basic sgRNA target search of input sequences for single-sgRNA and two-sgRNA/Cas9 nickase targeting, as well as common and unique sgRNA target searches in 1) a set of input sequences; 2) a set of similar genes or transcripts; or 3) transcripts a single gene. We demonstrate potential uses of the program by identifying unique isoform-specific sgRNA sites in 71% of zebrafish alternative transcripts and common sgRNA target sites in approximately 40% of zebrafish duplicated gene pairs. The design of unique targets in alternative exons is helpful because it will facilitate functional genomic studies of transcript isoforms. Similarly, its application to duplicated genes may simplify multi-gene mutational targeting experiments. Overall, this program provides a unique interface that will enhance use of CRISPR/Cas technology.	SV Prykhozhij|V Rajan|D Gaston|JN Berman
25732831	The CRISPR/Cas9 technology enables the introduction of genomic alterations into almost any organism; however, systems for efficient and inducible gene modification have been lacking, especially for deletion of essential genes. Here, we describe a drug-inducible small guide RNA (sgRNA) vector system allowing for ubiquitous and efficient gene deletion in murine and human cells. This system mediates the efficient, temporally controlled deletion of MCL-1, both in vitro and in vivo, in human Burkitt lymphoma cell lines that require this anti-apoptotic BCL-2 protein for sustained survival and growth. Unexpectedly, repeated induction of the same sgRNA generated similar inactivating mutations in the human Mcl-1 gene due to low mutation variability exerted by the accompanying non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) process. Finally, we were able to generate hematopoietic cell compartment-restricted Trp53-knockout mice, leading to the identification of cancer-promoting mutants of this critical tumor suppressor.

25732830	Genetically encoded effectors are important tools for probing cellular function in living animals, but improved methods for directing their expression to specific cell types are required. Here, we introduce a simple, versatile method for achieving cell-type-specific expression of transgenes that leverages the untapped potential of "coding introns" (i.e., introns between coding exons). Our method couples the expression of a transgene to that of a native gene expressed in the cells of interest using intronically inserted "plug-and-play" cassettes (called "Trojan exons") that carry a splice acceptor site followed by the coding sequences of T2A peptide and an effector transgene. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach in Drosophila using lines containing suitable MiMIC (Minos-mediated integration cassette) transposons and a palette of Trojan exons capable of expressing a range of commonly used transcription factors. We also introduce an exchangeable, MiMIC-like Trojan exon construct that can be targeted to coding introns using the Crispr/Cas system.

25731961	As a powerful genome-editing tool, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-associated protein 9 (Cas9) system has been quickly developed into a large-scale function-based screening strategy in mammalian cells. This new type of genetic library is constructed through the lentiviral delivery of single-guide RNA collections that direct Cas9 or inactive dead Cas9 fused with effectors to interrogate gene function or regulate gene transcription in targeted cells. Compared with RNA interference screening, the CRISPR-Cas9 system demonstrates much higher levels of effectiveness and reliability with respect to both loss-of-function and gain-of-function screening. Unlike the RNA interference strategy, a CRISPR-Cas9 library can target both protein-coding sequences and regulatory elements, including promoters, enhancers and elements transcribing microRNAs and long noncoding RNAs. This powerful genetic tool will undoubtedly accelerate the mechanistic discovery of various biological processes. In this mini review, we summarize the general procedure of CRISPR-Cas9 library mediated functional screening, system optimization strategies and applications of this new genetic toolkit.

25728500	Functional genomics attempts to understand the genome by perturbing the flow of information from DNA to RNA to protein, in order to learn how gene dysfunction leads to disease. CRISPR/Cas9 technology is the newest tool in the geneticist's toolbox, allowing researchers to edit DNA with unprecedented ease, speed and accuracy, and representing a novel means to perform genome-wide genetic screens to discover gene function. In this review, we first summarize the discovery and characterization of CRISPR/Cas9, and then compare it to other genome engineering technologies. We discuss its initial use in screening applications, with a focus on optimizing on-target activity and minimizing off-target effects. Finally, we comment on future challenges and opportunities afforded by this technology.	E Hartenian|JG Doench

25716921	Current therapy for controlling human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection and preventing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) progression has profoundly decreased viral replication in cells susceptible to HIV-1 infection, but it does not eliminate the low level of viral replication in latently infected cells, which contain integrated copies of HIV-1 proviral DNA. There is an urgent need for the development of HIV-1 genome eradication strategies that will lead to a permanent or "sterile" cure of HIV-1/AIDS. In the past few years, novel nuclease-initiated genome editing tools have been developing rapidly, including zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and the CRISPR/Cas9 system. These surgical knives, which can excise any genome, provide a great opportunity to eradicate the HIV-1 genome by targeting highly conserved regions of the HIV-1 long terminal repeats or essential viral genes. Given the time consuming and costly engineering of target-specific ZFNs and TALENs, the RNA-guided endonuclease Cas9 technology has emerged as a simpler and more versatile technology to allow permanent removal of integrated HIV-1 proviral DNA in eukaryotic cells, and hopefully animal models or human patients. The major unmet challenges of this approach at present include inefficient nuclease gene delivery, potential off-target cleavage, and cell-specific genome targeting. Nanoparticle or lentivirus-mediated delivery of next generation Cas9 technologies including nickase or RNA-guided FokI nuclease (RFN) will further improve the potential for genome editing to become a promising approach for curing HIV-1/AIDS.

25713381	The intranuclear location of genomic loci and the dynamics of these loci are important parameters for understanding the spatial and temporal regulation of gene expression. Recently it has proven possible to visualize endogenous genomic loci in live cells by the use of transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs), as well as modified versions of the bacterial immunity clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) system. Here we report the design of multicolor versions of CRISPR using catalytically inactive Cas9 endonuclease (dCas9) from three bacterial orthologs. Each pair of dCas9-fluorescent proteins and cognate single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) efficiently labeled several target loci in live human cells. Using pairs of differently colored dCas9-sgRNAs, it was possible to determine the intranuclear distance between loci on different chromosomes. In addition, the fluorescence spatial resolution between two loci on the same chromosome could be determined and related to the linear distance between them on the chromosome's physical map, thereby permitting assessment of the DNA compaction of such regions in a live cell.

25713377	Cas9, an RNA-guided DNA endonuclease found in clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) bacterial immune systems, is a versatile tool for genome editing, transcriptional regulation, and cellular imaging applications. Structures of Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 alone or bound to single-guide RNA (sgRNA) and target DNA revealed a bilobed protein architecture that undergoes major conformational changes upon guide RNA and DNA binding. To investigate the molecular determinants and relevance of the interlobe rearrangement for target recognition and cleavage, we designed a split-Cas9 enzyme in which the nuclease lobe and α-helical lobe are expressed as separate polypeptides. Although the lobes do not interact on their own, the sgRNA recruits them into a ternary complex that recapitulates the activity of full-length Cas9 and catalyzes site-specific DNA cleavage. The use of a modified sgRNA abrogates split-Cas9 activity by preventing dimerization, allowing for the development of an inducible dimerization system. We propose that split-Cas9 can act as a highly regulatable platform for genome-engineering applications.	AV Wright|SH Sternberg|DW Taylor|BT Staahl|JA Bardales|JE Kornfeld|JA Doudna
25713109	First introduced into mammalian organisms in 2013, the RNA-guided genome editing tool CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated nuclease 9) offers several advantages over conventional ones, such as simple-to-design, easy-to-use and multiplexing (capable of editing multiple genes simultaneously). Consequently, it has become a cost-effective and convenient tool for various genome editing purposes including gene therapy studies. In cell lines or animal models, CRISPR-Cas9 can be applied for therapeutic purposes in several ways. It can correct the causal mutations in monogenic disorders and thus rescue the disease phenotypes, which currently represents the most translatable field in CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene therapy. CRISPR-Cas9 can also engineer pathogen genome such as HIV for therapeutic purposes, or induce protective or therapeutic mutations in host tissues. Moreover, CRISPR-Cas9 has shown potentials in cancer gene therapy such as deactivating oncogenic virus and inducing oncosuppressor expressions. Herein, we review the research on CRISPR-mediated gene therapy, discuss its advantages, limitations and possible solutions, and propose directions for future research, with an emphasis on the opportunities and challenges of CRISPR-Cas9 in cancer gene therapy.

25712141	The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat - CRISPR-associated genes (CRISPR-Cas) system is used by bacteria and archaea against invading conjugative plasmids or bacteriophages. Central to this immunity system are genomic CRISPR loci that contain fragments of invading DNA. These are maintained as spacers in the CRISPR loci between direct repeats and the spacer composition in any bacterium reflects its evolutionary history. We analysed the CRISPR locus sequences of 335 Yersinia pseudotuberculosis complex strains. Altogether 1902 different spacer sequences were identified and these were used to generate a database for the spacer sequences. Only ∼10% of the spacer sequences found matching sequences. In addition, surprisingly few spacers were shared by Yersinia pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis strains. Interestingly, 32 different protospacers were present in the conjugative plasmid pYptb32953. The corresponding spacers were identified from 35 different Y. pseudotuberculosis strains indicating that these strains had encountered pYptb32953 earlier. In conjugation experiments, pYptb32953-specific spacers generally prevented conjugation with spacer-positive and spacer-free strains. However, some strains with one to four spacers were invaded by pYptb32953 and some spacer-free strains were fully resistant. Also some spacer-positive strains were intermediate resistant to conjugation. This suggests that one or more other defence systems are determining conjugation efficiency independent of the CRISPR-Cas system.

25712100	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) RNA-guided nucleases have gathered considerable excitement as a tool for genome engineering. However, questions remain about the specificity of target site recognition. Cleavage specificity is typically evaluated by low throughput assays (T7 endonuclease I assay, target amplification followed by high-throughput sequencing), which are limited to a subset of potential off-target sites. Here, we used ChIP-seq to examine genome-wide CRISPR binding specificity at gRNA-specific and gRNA-independent sites for two guide RNAs. RNA-guided Cas9 binding was highly specific to the target site while off-target binding occurred at much lower intensities. Cas9-bound regions were highly enriched in NGG sites, a sequence required for target site recognition by Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9. To determine the relationship between Cas9 binding and endonuclease activity, we applied targeted sequence capture, which allowed us to survey 1200 genomic loci simultaneously including potential off-target sites identified by ChIP-seq and by computational prediction. A high frequency of indels was observed at both target sites and one off-target site, while no cleavage activity could be detected at other ChIP-bound regions. Our results confirm the high-specificity of CRISPR endonucleases and demonstrate that sequence capture can be used as a high-throughput genome-wide approach to identify off-target activity.

25712033	Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are the most widely used mammalian hosts for production of therapeutic proteins. However, development of recombinant CHO cell lines has been hampered by unstable and variable transgene expression caused by random integration. Here we demonstrate efficient targeted gene integration into site-specific loci in CHO cells using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system and compatible donor plasmid harboring a gene of interest (GOI) and short homology arms. This strategy has enabled precise insertion of a 3.7-kb gene expression cassette at defined loci in CHO cells following a simple drug-selection, resulting in homogeneous transgene expression. Taken together, the results displayed here can help pave the way for the targeting of GOI to specific loci in CHO cells, increasing the likelihood of generating isogenic cell lines with consistent protein production.

25710183	The CRISPR (clustered, regularly, interspaced, short, palindromic repeats)-Cas (CRISPR-associated genes) systems of archaea and bacteria provide adaptive immunity against viruses and other selfish elements and are believed to curtail horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Limiting acquisition of new genetic material could be one of the sources of the fitness cost of CRISPR-Cas maintenance and one of the causes of the patchy distribution of CRISPR-Cas among bacteria, and across environments. We sought to test the hypothesis that the activity of CRISPR-Cas in microbes is negatively correlated with the extent of recent HGT. Using three independent measures of HGT, we found no significant dependence between the length of CRISPR arrays, which reflects the activity of the immune system, and the estimated number of recent HGT events. In contrast, we observed a significant negative dependence between the estimated extent of HGT and growth temperature of microbes, which could be explained by the lower genetic diversity in hotter environments. We hypothesize that the relevant events in the evolution of resistance to mobile elements and proclivity for HGT, to which CRISPR-Cas systems seem to substantially contribute, occur on the population scale rather than on the timescale of species evolution.

25707807	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) loci and their associated (Cas) proteins provide adaptive immunity against viral infection in prokaryotes. Upon infection, short phage sequences known as spacers integrate between CRISPR repeats and are transcribed into small RNA molecules that guide the Cas9 nuclease to the viral targets (protospacers). Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 cleavage of the viral genome requires the presence of a 5'-NGG-3' protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence immediately downstream of the viral target. It is not known whether and how viral sequences flanked by the correct PAM are chosen as new spacers. Here we show that Cas9 selects functional spacers by recognizing their PAM during spacer acquisition. The replacement of cas9 with alleles that lack the PAM recognition motif or recognize an NGGNG PAM eliminated or changed PAM specificity during spacer acquisition, respectively. Cas9 associates with other proteins of the acquisition machinery (Cas1, Cas2 and Csn2), presumably to provide PAM-specificity to this process. These results establish a new function for Cas9 in the genesis of prokaryotic immunological memory.	R Heler|P Samai|JW Modell|C Weiner|GW Goldberg|D Bikard|LA Marraffini

25707795	Bacteria and archaea insert spacer sequences acquired from foreign DNAs into CRISPR loci to generate immunological memory. The Escherichia coli Cas1-Cas2 complex mediates spacer acquisition in vivo, but the molecular mechanism of this process is unknown. Here we show that the purified Cas1-Cas2 complex integrates oligonucleotide DNA substrates into acceptor DNA to yield products similar to those generated by retroviral integrases and transposases. Cas1 is the catalytic subunit and Cas2 substantially increases integration activity. Protospacer DNA with free 3'-OH ends and supercoiled target DNA are required, and integration occurs preferentially at the ends of CRISPR repeats and at sequences adjacent to cruciform structures abutting AT-rich regions, similar to the CRISPR leader sequence. Our results demonstrate the Cas1-Cas2 complex to be the minimal machinery that catalyses spacer DNA acquisition and explain the significance of CRISPR repeats in providing sequence and structural specificity for Cas1-Cas2-mediated adaptive immunity.

25706932	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) are polymorphic elements found in the genome of some or all strains of particular bacterial species, providing them with a system of acquired immunity against invading bacteriophages and plasmids. Two CRISPR-Cas systems have been identified in Acinetobacter baumannii, an opportunistic pathogen with a remarkable capacity for clonal dissemination. In this study, we investigated the mode of evolution and diversity of spacers of the CRISPR-cas subtype I-Fb locus in a global collection of 76 isolates of A. baumannii obtained from 14 countries and 4 continents. The locus has basically evolved from a common ancestor following two main lineages and several pathways of vertical descent. However, this vertical passage has been interrupted by occasional events of horizontal transfer of the whole locus between distinct isolates. The isolates were assigned into 40 CRISPR-based sequence types (CST). CST1 and CST23-24 comprised 18 and 9 isolates, representing two main sub-clones of international clones CC1 and CC25, respectively. Epidemiological data showed that some of the CST1 isolates were acquired or imported from Iraq, where it has probably been endemic for more than one decade and occasionally been able to spread to USA, Canada, and Europe. CST23-24 has shown a remarkable ability to cause national outbreaks of infections in Sweden, Argentina, UAE, and USA. The three isolates of CST19 were independently imported from Thailand to Sweden and Norway, raising a concern about the prevalence of CST19 in Thailand. Our study highlights the dynamic nature of the CRISPR-cas subtype I-Fb locus in A. baumannii, and demonstrates the possibility of using a CRISPR-based approach for subtyping a significant part of the global population of A. baumannii.

25706875	Human colorectal tumors bear recurrent mutations in genes encoding proteins operative in the WNT, MAPK, TGF-β, TP53 and PI3K pathways. Although these pathways influence intestinal stem cell niche signaling, the extent to which mutations in these pathways contribute to human colorectal carcinogenesis remains unclear. Here we use the CRISPR-Cas9 genome-editing system to introduce multiple such mutations into organoids derived from normal human intestinal epithelium. By modulating the culture conditions to mimic that of the intestinal niche, we selected isogenic organoids harboring mutations in the tumor suppressor genes APC, SMAD4 and TP53, and in the oncogenes KRAS and/or PIK3CA. Organoids engineered to express all five mutations grew independently of niche factors in vitro, and they formed tumors after implantation under the kidney subcapsule in mice. Although they formed micrometastases containing dormant tumor-initiating cells after injection into the spleen of mice, they failed to colonize in the liver. In contrast, engineered organoids derived from chromosome-instable human adenomas formed macrometastatic colonies. These results suggest that 'driver' pathway mutations enable stem cell maintenance in the hostile tumor microenvironment, but that additional molecular lesions are required for invasive behavior.

25704665	The success of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii as a model organism is to a large extent due to the wide range of molecular techniques that are available for its characterization. Here, we review some of the techniques currently used to modify and interrogate the C. reinhardtii nuclear genome and explore several technologies under development. Nuclear mutants can be generated with ultraviolet (UV) light and chemical mutagens, or by insertional mutagenesis. Nuclear transformation methods include biolistic delivery, agitation with glass beads, and electroporation. Transforming DNA integrates into the genome at random sites, and multiple strategies exist for mapping insertion sites. A limited number of studies have demonstrated targeted modification of the nuclear genome by approaches such as zinc-finger nucleases and homologous recombination. RNA interference is widely used to knock down expression levels of nuclear genes. A wide assortment of transgenes has been successfully expressed in the Chlamydomonas nuclear genome, including transformation markers, fluorescent proteins, reporter genes, epitope tagged proteins, and even therapeutic proteins. Optimized expression constructs and strains help transgene expression. Emerging technologies such as the CRISPR/Cas9 system, high-throughput mutant identification, and a whole-genome knockout library are being developed for this organism. We discuss how these advances will propel future investigations.	RE Jinkerson|MC Jonikas
25698413	Manipulation of genomic sequences facilitates the identification and characterization of key genetic determinants in the investigation of biological processes. Genome editing via clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated (Cas) constitutes a next-generation method for programmable and high-throughput functional genomics. CRISPR-Cas systems are readily reprogrammed to induce sequence-specific DNA breaks at target loci, resulting in fixed mutations via host-dependent DNA repair mechanisms. Although bacterial genome editing is a relatively unexplored and underrepresented application of CRISPR-Cas systems, recent studies provide valuable insights for the widespread future implementation of this technology. This review summarizes recent progress in bacterial genome editing and identifies fundamental genetic and phenotypic outcomes of CRISPR targeting in bacteria, in the context of tool development, genome homeostasis, and DNA repair.

25690852	CRISPR-Cas9-based genome editing enables the rapid genetic manipulation of any genomic locus without the need for gene targeting by homologous recombination. Here we describe a conditional transgenic approach that allows temporal control of CRISPR-Cas9 activity for inducible genome editing in adult mice. We show that doxycycline-regulated Cas9 induction enables widespread gene disruption in multiple tissues and that limiting the duration of Cas9 expression or using a Cas9(D10A) (Cas9n) variant can regulate the frequency and size of target gene modifications, respectively. Further, we show that this inducible CRISPR (iCRISPR) system can be used effectively to create biallelic mutation in multiple target loci and, thus, provides a flexible and fast platform to study loss-of-function phenotypes in vivo.

25680931	The anaerobic spore-forming, gram-positive, solventogenic clostridia are notorious for being difficult to genetically engineer. Based on CRISPR/Cas9 assisted homologous recombination, we demonstrated that clean markerless gene deletion from the chromosome can be easily achieved with a high efficiency through a single-step transformation in Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB 8052, one of the most prominent strains for acetone, butanol and ethanol (ABE) production. This highly efficient genome engineering system can be further explored for multiplex genome engineering purposes. The protocols and principles developed in this study provided valuable references for genome engineering in other microorganisms lacking developed genetic engineering tools.

25664545	Although RNA-guided genome editing via the CRISPR-Cas9 system is now widely used in biomedical research, genome-wide target specificities of Cas9 nucleases remain controversial. Here we present Digenome-seq, in vitro Cas9-digested whole-genome sequencing, to profile genome-wide Cas9 off-target effects in human cells. This in vitro digest yields sequence reads with the same 5' ends at cleavage sites that can be computationally identified. We validated off-target sites at which insertions or deletions were induced with frequencies below 0.1%, near the detection limit of targeted deep sequencing. We also showed that Cas9 nucleases can be highly specific, inducing off-target mutations at merely several, rather than thousands of, sites in the entire genome and that Cas9 off-target effects can be avoided by replacing 'promiscuous' single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) with modified sgRNAs. Digenome-seq is a robust, sensitive, unbiased and cost-effective method for profiling genome-wide off-target effects of programmable nucleases including Cas9.

25663455	The adaptation of the CRISPR/Cas9 DNA engineering machinery for mammalian cells has revolutionized our approaches to low- or high-throughput genome annotation and paved the way for conceptually novel therapeutic strategies. A large part of the attraction of CRISPR stems from the small size of its two core components--Cas9 and gRNA--and hence its compatibility with virtually any available viral vector delivery system. As a result, over the past two years, four major classes of viral vectors have already been engineered and applied as CRISPR delivery tools--retroviruses, lentiviruses, adenoviruses, and adeno-associated viruses (AAVs). The juxtaposition of these two technologies reflects a case of tremendous mutual attraction and holds unprecedented promises for biology and medicine. Here, we provide an overview of the state-of-the-art of this rapidly emerging field, from a comparative description of the principal vector designs, to a synopsis of some of the most exciting applications that were reported to date, including the use of viral CRISPR vectors for genome-wide loss-of-function screens, multiplexed gene editing or disease modeling in animals. Once specificity and safety have been improved further, viral vector-mediated in vitro/in vivo CRISPR delivery and expression promise to radically transform basic and applied biomedical research.

25658371	The bacterial CRISPR-Cas9 system has emerged as an effective tool for sequence-specific gene knockout through non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), but it remains inefficient for precise editing of genome sequences. Here we develop a reporter-based screening approach for high-throughput identification of chemical compounds that can modulate precise genome editing through homology-directed repair (HDR). Using our screening method, we have identified small molecules that can enhance CRISPR-mediated HDR efficiency, 3-fold for large fragment insertions and 9-fold for point mutations. Interestingly, we have also observed that a small molecule that inhibits HDR can enhance frame shift insertion and deletion (indel) mutations mediated by NHEJ. The identified small molecules function robustly in diverse cell types with minimal toxicity. The use of small molecules provides a simple and effective strategy to enhance precise genome engineering applications and facilitates the study of DNA repair mechanisms in mammalian cells.

25638686	CRISPR/Cas9 is a simple and efficient tool for targeted and marker-free genome engineering. Here, we report the development and successful application of a multiplex CRISPR/Cas9 system for genome engineering of up to 5 different genomic loci in one transformation step in baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. To assess the specificity of the tool we employed genome re-sequencing to screen for off-target sites in all single knock-out strains targeted by different gRNAs. This extensive analysis identified no more genome variants in CRISPR/Cas9 engineered strains compared to wild-type reference strains. We applied our genome engineering tool for an exploratory analysis of all possible single, double, triple, quadruple and quintuple gene disruption combinations to search for strains with high mevalonate production, a key intermediate for the industrially important isoprenoid biosynthesis pathway. Even though we did not overexpress any genes in the mevalonate pathway, this analysis identified strains with mevalonate titers greater than 41-fold compared to the wild-type strain. Our findings illustrate the applicability of this highly specific and efficient multiplex genome engineering approach to accelerate functional genomics and metabolic engineering efforts.

25630351	Prokaryotic viruses play a major role in the microbial ecology and evolution. However, the virosphere associated with deep-sea hydrothermal ecosystems remains largely unexplored. Numerous instances of lateral gene transfer have contributed to the complex and incongruent evolutionary history of Thermotogales, an order well represented in deep-sea hydrothermal vents. The presence of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) loci has been reported in all Thermotogales genomes, suggesting that these bacteria have been exposed to viral infections that could have mediated gene exchange. In this study, we isolated and characterized the first virus infecting bacteria from the order Thermotogales, Marinitoga piezophila virus 1 (MPV1). The host, Marinitoga piezophila is a thermophilic, anaerobic and piezophilic bacterium isolated from a deep-sea hydrothermal chimney. MPV1 is a temperate Siphoviridae-like virus with a 43.7 kb genome. Surprisingly, we found that MPV1 virions carry not only the viral DNA but preferentially package a plasmid of 13.3 kb (pMP1) also carried by M. piezophila. This 'ménage à trois' highlights potential relevance of selfish genetic elements in facilitating lateral gene transfer in the deep-sea biosphere.

25628355	Metazoan Tap-p15 (also called Nxf1-Nxt1) and yeast Mex67-Mtr2 heterodimers are the general mRNA export receptors. The RNA binding activity of Tap-p15, which is essential for mRNA nuclear export, has been attributed to the amino-terminal RNA binding module of Tap consists of RNA recognition motif (RRM) and leucine-rich repeat. In this study, we identified a novel RNA interaction surface in the NTF2-like (NTF2L) domain of Tap, which is analogous to the rRNA binding platform of Mex67-Mtr2. Tap-p15 uses the three domains to tightly bind the retroviral constitutive transport element. The RNA binding through the NTF2L domain is functionally relevant as introduction of mutations in this region reduced CTE-containing mRNA export activity. In contrast, only when the RRM and NTF2L domains were mutated simultaneously, bulk poly (A)(+) RNA export and in vivo poly (A)(+) RNA binding activities of Tap-p15 were significantly attenuated. Moreover, an engineered human cell line harboring the NTF2L domain mutation in the NXF1 gene showed a synthetic growth phenotype and severe mRNA export defect under Aly/REF and Thoc5 depleted condition. These data suggest that Tap-p15 recognizes bulk mRNAs through combinatorial use of the distinct RNA binding domains.	J Katahira|L Dimitrova|Y Imai|E Hurt
25627339	Metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing was conducted on cyanobacterial mats of the Middle Island Sinkhole (MIS), Lake Huron. Metagenomic data from 14 samples collected over 5 years were used to reconstruct genomes of two genotypes of a novel virus, designated PhV1 type A and PhV1 type B. Both viral genotypes encode and express nblA, a gene involved in degrading phycobilisomes, which are complexes of pigmented proteins that harvest light for photosynthesis. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the viral-encoded nblA is derived from the host cyanobacterium, Phormidium MIS-PhA. The cyanobacterial host also has two complete CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) systems that serve as defence mechanisms for bacteria and archaea against viruses and plasmids. One 45 bp CRISPR spacer from Phormidium had 100% nucleotide identity to PhV1 type B, but this region was absent from PhV1 type A. Transcripts from PhV1 and the Phormidium CRISPR loci were detected in all six metatranscriptomic data sets (three during the day and three at night), indicating that both are transcriptionally active in the environment. These results reveal ecological and genetic interactions between viruses and cyanobacteria at MIS, highlighting the value of parallel analysis of viruses and hosts in understanding ecological interactions in natural communities.

25619936	Targeted endogenous gene activation is necessary for understanding complex gene networks and has great potential in medical and industrial applications. The CRISPR-Cas system offers simple and powerful tools for this purpose. However, these CRISPR-Cas-based tools for activating user-defined genes are unable to offer precise temporal control of gene expression, despite the fact that many biological phenomena are regulated by highly dynamic patterns of gene expression. Here we created a light-inducible, user-defined, endogenous gene activation system based on CRISPR-Cas9. We demonstrated that this CRISPR-Cas9-based transcription system can allow rapid and reversible targeted gene activation by light. In addition, using this system, we have exemplified photoactivation of multiple user-defined endogenous genes in mammalian cells. The present CRISPR-Cas9-based transcription system offers simple and versatile approaches for precise endogenous gene activation in basic biological research and biotechnology applications.

25613576	Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) encompasses many different hereditary retinal degenerations that are caused by a vast array of different gene mutations and have highly variable disease presentations and severities. This heterogeneity poses a significant therapeutic challenge, although an answer may eventually be found through two recent innovations: induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas genome editing.	This review discusses the wide-ranging applications of iPSCs and CRISPR-including disease modelling, diagnostics and therapeutics - with an ultimate view towards understanding how these two technologies can come together to address disease heterogeneity and orphan genes in a novel personalized medicine platform. An extensive literature search was conducted in PubMed and Google Scholar, with a particular focus on high-impact research published within the last 1 - 2 years and centered broadly on the subjects of retinal gene therapy, iPSC-derived outer retina cells, stem cell transplantation and CRISPR/Cas gene editing.	For the retinal pigment epithelium, autologous transplantation of gene-corrected grafts derived from iPSCs may well be technically feasible in the near future. Photoreceptor transplantation faces more significant unresolved technical challenges but remains an achievable, if more distant, goal given the rapid pace of advancements in the field.

25608814	IGF2 (Insulin-like growth factor 2) is a major growth factor affecting porcine fetal and postnatal development. We propose that the precise modification of IGF2 gene of Chinese indigenous pig breed--Lantang pig by genome editing technology could reduce its backfat thickness, and increase its lean meat content. Here, we tested the genome editing activities of zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and CRISPR/Cas9 system on IGF2 gene in the Lantang porcine fetal fibroblasts (PEF). The results indicated that CRISPR/Cas9 presented cutting efficiency up to 9.2%, which was significantly higher than that generated by ZFNs with DNA cutting efficiency lower than 1%. However, even by using CRISPR/Cas9, the relatively lower percentage of genetically modified cells in the transfected population was not satisfied for somatic nuclear transfer (SCNT). Therefore, we used a SSA (Single-strand annealing) reporter system to enrich genetically modified cells induced by ZFN or CRISPR/Cas9. T7 endonuclease I assay revealed that this strategy improved genome editing activity of CRISPR/Cas9 by 5 folds, and was even more effective for improving genome editing efficiency of ZFN.

25603988	Molecular scissors (MS), incl. Zinc Finger Nucleases (ZFN), Transcription-activator like endoncleases (TALENS) and meganucleases possess long recognition sites and are thus capable of cutting DNA in a very specific manner. These molecular scissors mediate targeted genetic alterations by enhancing the DNA mutation rate via induction of double-strand breaks at a predetermined genomic site. Compared to conventional homologous recombination based gene targeting, MS can increase the targeting rate 10,000-fold, and gene disruption via mutagenic DNA repair is stimulated at a similar frequency. The successful application of different MS has been shown in different organisms, including insects, amphibians, plants, nematodes, and mammals, including humans. Recently, another novel class of molecular scissors was described that uses RNAs to target a specific genomic site. The CRISPR/Cas9 system is capable of targeting even multiple genomic sites in one shot and thus could be superior to ZFNs or TALEN, especially by its easy design. MS can be successfully employed for improving the understanding of complex physiological systems, producing transgenic animals, incl. creating large animal models for human diseases, creating specific cell lines, and plants, and even for treating human genetic diseases. This review provides an update on molecular scissors, their underlying mechanism and focuses on new opportunities for generating genetically modified farm animals.	B Petersen|H Niemann
25590615	MicroRNA knockout by genome editing technologies is promising. In order to extend the application of the technology and to investigate the function of a specific miRNA, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to deplete human miR-93 from a cluster by targeting its 5' region in HeLa cells. Various small indels were induced in the targeted region containing the Drosha processing site and seed sequences. Interestingly, we found that even a single nucleotide deletion led to complete knockout of the target miRNA with high specificity. Functional knockout was confirmed by phenotype analysis. Furthermore, de novo microRNAs were not found by RNA-seq. Nevertheless, expression of the pri-microRNAs was increased. When combined with structural analysis, the data indicated that biogenesis was impaired. Altogether, we showed that small indels in the 5' region of a microRNA result in sequence depletion as well as Drosha processing retard.	Q Jiang|X Meng|L Meng|N Chang|J Xiong|H Cao|Z Liang
25589547	CRISPR-Cas systems are RNA-based immune systems that protect prokaryotes from invaders such as phages and plasmids. In adaptation, the initial phase of the immune response, short foreign DNA fragments are captured and integrated into host CRISPR loci to provide heritable defense against encountered foreign nucleic acids. Each CRISPR contains a ∼100-500 bp leader element that typically includes a transcription promoter, followed by an array of captured ∼35 bp sequences (spacers) sandwiched between copies of an identical ∼35 bp direct repeat sequence. New spacers are added immediately downstream of the leader. Here, we have analyzed adaptation to phage infection in Streptococcus thermophilus at the CRISPR1 locus to identify cis-acting elements essential for the process. We show that the leader and a single repeat of the CRISPR locus are sufficient for adaptation in this system. Moreover, we identified a leader sequence element capable of stimulating adaptation at a dormant repeat. We found that sequences within 10 bp of the site of integration, in both the leader and repeat of the CRISPR, are required for the process. Our results indicate that information at the CRISPR leader-repeat junction is critical for adaptation in this Type II-A system and likely other CRISPR-Cas systems.	Y Wei|MT Chesne|RM Terns|MP Terns
25587897	The bacterial CRISPR-Cas9 system has been adapted for use as a genome editing tool. While several recent reports have indicated that successful genome editing of mice can be achieved, detailed phenotypic and molecular analyses of the mutant animals are limited. Following pronuclear micro-injection of fertilized eggs with either wild-type Cas9 or the nickase mutant (D10A) and single or paired guide RNA (sgRNA) for targeting of the tyrosinase (Tyr) gene, we assessed genome editing in mice using rapid phenotypic readouts (eye and coat color). Mutant mice with insertions or deletions (indels) in Tyr were efficiently generated without detectable off-target cleavage events. Gene correction of a single nucleotide by homologous recombination (HR) could only occur when the sgRNA recognition sites in the donor DNA were modified. Gene repair did not occur if the donor DNA was not modified because Cas9 catalytic activity was completely inhibited. Our results indicate that allelic mosaicism can occur following -Cas9-mediated editing in mice and appears to correlate with sgRNA cleavage efficiency at the single-cell stage. We also show that larger than expected deletions may be overlooked based on the screening strategy employed. An unbiased analysis of all the deleted nucleotides in our experiments revealed that the highest frequencies of nucleotide deletions were clustered around the predicted Cas9 cleavage sites, with slightly broader distributions than expected. Finally, additional analysis of founder mice and their offspring indicate that their general health, fertility, and the transmission of genetic changes were not compromised. These results provide the foundation to interpret and predict the diverse outcomes following CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing experiments in mice.

25586224	Gene knockout strategies, RNAi and rescue experiments are all employed to study mammalian gene function. However, the disadvantages of these approaches include: loss of function adaptation, reduced viability and gene overexpression that rarely matches endogenous levels. Here, we developed an endogenous gene knockdown/rescue strategy that combines RNAi selectivity with a highly efficient CRISPR directed recombinant Adeno-Associated Virus (rAAV) mediated gene targeting approach to introduce allele-specific mutations plus an allele-selective siRNA Sensitive (siSN) site that allows for studying gene mutations while maintaining endogenous expression and regulation of the gene of interest. CRISPR/Cas9 plus rAAV targeted gene-replacement and introduction of allele-specific RNAi sensitivity mutations in the CDK2 and CDK1 genes resulted in a >85% site-specific recombination of Neo-resistant clones versus ∼8% for rAAV alone. RNAi knockdown of wild type (WT) Cdk2 with siWT in heterozygotic knockin cells resulted in the mutant Cdk2 phenotype cell cycle arrest, whereas allele specific knockdown of mutant CDK2 with siSN resulted in a wild type phenotype. Together, these observations demonstrate the ability of CRISPR plus rAAV to efficiently recombine a genomic locus and tag it with a selective siRNA sequence that allows for allele-selective phenotypic assays of the gene of interest while it remains expressed and regulated under endogenous control mechanisms.

25581723	While there is currently burgeoning interest in the application of the CRISPR/Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated genes) to genome editing, it is perhaps not widely appreciated that this is the second discovery of a small RNA (sRNA)-targeted DNA-deletion system. The first sRNA-targeted DNA-deletion system to be discovered, which we call IES/Ias (internal eliminated sequence/IES-associated genes) to contrast with CRISPR/Cas, is found in ciliates, and, like CRISPR/Cas, is thought to serve as a form of immune defense against invasive DNAs. The manner in which the ciliate IES/Ias system functions is distinct from that of the CRISPR/Cas system in archaea and bacteria, and arose independently through a synthesis of RNA interference-derived and DNA-specific molecular components. Despite the major differences between CRISPR/Cas and IES/Ias, both systems face similar conceptual challenges in targeting invasive DNAs. In this review, we focus on the discovery, effects, function, and evolutionary consequences of the IES/Ias system.	EC Swart|M Nowacki
25580533	Recent genome-wide expression profiling studies have uncovered a huge amount of novel, long non-protein-coding RNA transcripts (lncRNA). In general, these transcripts possess a low, but tissue-specific expression, and their nucleotide sequences are often poorly conserved. However, several studies showed that lncRNAs can have important roles for normal tissue development and regulate cellular pluripotency as well as differentiation. Moreover, lncRNAs are implicated in the control of multiple molecular pathways leading to gene expression changes and thus, ultimately modulate cell proliferation, migration and apoptosis. Consequently, deregulation of lncRNA expression contributes to carcinogenesis and is associated with human diseases, e.g., neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's Disease. Here, we will focus on some major challenges of lncRNA research, especially loss-of-function studies. We will delineate strategies for lncRNA gene targeting in vivo, and we will briefly discuss important consideration and pitfalls when investigating lncRNA functions in knockout animal models. Finally, we will highlight future opportunities for lncRNAs research by applying the concept of cross-species comparison, which might contribute to novel disease biomarker discovery and might identify lncRNAs as potential therapeutic targets.

25579209	Validation of drug-target interaction is essential in drug discovery and development. The ultimate proof for drug-target validation requires the introduction of mutations that confer resistance in cells, an approach that is not straightforward in mammalian cells. Using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, we show that a homozygous genomic C528S mutation in the XPO1 gene confers cells with resistance to selinexor (KPT-330). Selinexor is an orally bioavailable inhibitor of exportin-1 (CRM1/XPO1) with potent anticancer activity and is currently under evaluation in human clinical trials. Mutant cells were resistant to the induction of cytotoxicity, apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and inhibition of XPO1 function, including direct binding of the drug to XPO1. These results validate XPO1 as the prime target of selinexor in cells and identify the selectivity of this drug toward the cysteine 528 residue of XPO1. Our findings demonstrate that CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing enables drug-target validation and drug-target selectivity studies in cancer cells.

25578968	The histone demethylase JMJ14 catalyzes histone demethylation at lysine 4 of histone 3 and is involved in transcriptional repression and flowering time control in Arabidopsis. Here, we report that JMJ14 is physically associated with two previously uncharacterized NAC transcription factors, NAC050 and NAC052. The NAC050/052-RNAi plants and the CRISPR-CAS9-mediated nac050/052 double mutant plants show an early flowering phenotype, which is similar to the phenotype of jmj14, suggesting a functional association between JMJ14 and NAC050/052. RNA-seq data indicated that hundreds of common target genes are co-regulated by JMJ14 and NAC50/052. Our ChIP analysis demonstrated that JMJ14 and NAC050 directly bind to co-upregulated genes shared in jmj14 and NAC050/052-RNAi, thereby facilitating H3K4 demethylation and transcriptional repression. The NAC050/052 recognition DNA cis-element was identified by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay at the promoters of its target genes. Together, our study identifies two novel NAC transcription repressors and demonstrates that they are involved in transcriptional repression and flowering time control by associating with the histone demethylase JMJ14.

25572406	The addition of an RNA-guided nuclease, Cas9, to the gene editing toolbox has increased the accessibility of gene editing technologies by greatly simplifying the design of editing reagents. Only a single 75-100 nucleotide RNA is required to guide Cas9 to the target gene of interest, which has meant that the established infrastructure of short-hairpin RNA interference screen could be readily adapted to genome-wide knock out screens. Cas9-based editing technology should streamline the generation of animal and cell-line models, make the generation of activity-dead mutations in target validation routine, and enable the discovery of a new generation of targets across therapeutic areas.

25567986	Acquisition of de novo spacer sequences confers CRISPR-Cas with a memory to defend against invading genetic elements. However, the mechanism of regulation of CRISPR spacer acquisition remains unknown. Here we examine the transcriptional regulation of the conserved spacer acquisition genes in Type I-A of Sulfolobus islandicus REY15A. Csa3a, a MarR-like transcription factor encoded by the gene located adjacent to csa1, cas1, cas2 and cas4 cluster, but on the reverse strand, was demonstrated to specifically bind to the csa1 and cas1 promoters with the imperfect palindromic sequence. Importantly, it was demonstrated that the transcription level of csa1, cas1, cas2 and cas4 was significantly enhanced in a csa3a-overexpression strain and, moreover, the Csa1 and Cas1 protein levels were increased in this strain. Furthermore, we demonstrated the hyperactive uptake of unique spacers within both CRISPR loci in the presence of the csa3a overexpression vector. The spacer acquisition process is dependent on the CCN PAM sequence and protospacer selection is random and non-directional. These results suggested a regulation mechanism of CRISPR spacer acquisition where a single transcriptional regulator senses the presence of an invading element and then activates spacer acquisition gene expression which leads to de novo spacer uptake from the invading element.

25563494	CCT domain-containing genes generally control flowering in plants. Currently, only six of the 41 CCT family genes have been confirmed to control flowering in rice. To efficiently identify more heading date-related genes from the CCT family, we compared the positions of heading date QTLs and CCT genes and found that 25 CCT family genes were located in the QTL regions. Association mapping showed that a total of 19 CCT family genes were associated with the heading date. Five of the seven associated genes within QTL regions and two of four associated genes outside of the QTL regions were confirmed to regulate heading date by transformation. None of the seven non-associated genes outside of the QTL regions regulates heading date. Obviously, combination of candidate gene-based association mapping with linkage analysis could improve the identification of functional genes. Three novel CCT family genes, including one non-associated (OsCCT01) and two associated genes (OsCCT11 and OsCCT19) regulated the heading date. The overexpression of OsCCT01 delayed flowering through suppressing the expression of Ehd1, Hd3a and RFT1 under both long day and short day conditions. Potential functions in regulating heading date of some untested CCT family genes were discussed.	L Zhang|Q Li|H Dong|Q He|L Liang|C Tan|Z Han|W Yao|G Li|H Zhao|W Xie|Y Xing
25561351	We use a novel multidimensional searching approach to present the first exhaustive search for all possible repeated sequences in 166 genomes selected to cover the bacterial domain. We found an overrepresentation of repeated sequences in all but one of the genomes. The most prevalent repeats by far were related to interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs)—conferring bacterial adaptive immunity. We identified a deep branching clade of thermophilic Firmicutes containing the highest number of CRISPR repeats. We also identified a high prevalence of tandem repeated heptamers. In addition, we identified GC-rich repeats that could potentially be involved in recombination events. Finally, we identified repeats in a 16322 amino acid mega protein (involved in biofilm formation) and inverted repeats flanking miniature transposable elements (MITEs). In conclusion, the exhaustive search for repeated sequences identified new elements and distribution of these, which has implications for understanding both the ecology and evolution of bacteria.

25558753	Sucre municipality is a large, densely populated marginal area in the eastern part of Caracas, Venezuela that consistently has more cases of tuberculosis than other municipalities in the country. To identify the neighborhoods in the municipality with the highest prevalence of tuberculosis, and determine whether the Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain distribution in this municipality is different from that previously found in the western part of Caracas and the rest of Venezuela, we collected data on all tuberculosis cases in the municipality diagnosed in 2005-6. We performed two separate molecular epidemiological studies, spoligotyping 44 strains in a first study, and spoligotyping 131 strains, followed by MIRU-VNTR 15 on 21 clustered isolates in the second. With spoligotyping, the most common patterns were Shared International Type SIT17 (21%); SIT42 (15%); SIT93 (11%); SIT20 (7%); SIT53 (6%), a distribution similar to other parts of Venezuela, except that SIT42 and SIT20 were more common. MIRU-VNTR 15 showed that six of seven SIT17 strains examined belonged to a large cluster previously found circulating in Venezuela, but all of the SIT42 strains were related to a cluster centered in the neighborhoods of Unión and Maca, with a MIRU-VNTR pattern not previously seen in Venezuela. It appears that a large percentage of the tuberculosis in the Sucre municipality is caused by the active transmission of two strain families centered within distinct neighborhoods, one reflecting communication with the rest of the country, and the other suggesting the insular, isolated nature of some sectors.

25553825	Gene therapy by engineered nucleases is a genetic intervention being investigated for curing the hereditary disorders by targeting selected genes with specific nucleotides for establishment, suppression, abolishment of a function or correction of mutation. Here, we review the fast developing technology of targeted genome engineering using site specific programmable nucleases zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator like nucleases (TALENs) and cluster regulatory interspaced short palindromic repeat/CRISPR associated proteins (CRISPR/Cas) based RNA-guided DNA endonucleases (RGENs) and their different characteristics including pros and cons of genome modifications by these nucleases. We have further discussed different types of delivery methods to induce gene editing, novel development in genetic engineering other than nucleases and future prospects.	Q Ul Ain|JY Chung|YH Kim
25553515	Hepatitis B virus (HBV) remains a major human pathogen, with over 240 million individuals suffering from chronic HBV infections. These can persist for decades due to the lack of therapies that can effectively target the stable viral covalently closed circular (ccc) DNA molecules present in infected hepatocytes. Using lentiviral transduction of a bacterial Cas9 gene and single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) specific for HBV, we observed effective inhibition of HBV DNA production in in vitro models of both chronic and de novo HBV infection. Cas9/sgRNA combinations specific for HBV reduced total viral DNA levels by up to ~1000-fold and HBV cccDNA levels by up to ~10-fold and also mutationally inactivated the majority of the residual viral DNA. Together, these data provide proof of principle for the hypothesis that CRISPR/Cas systems have the potential to serve as effective tools for the depletion of the cccDNA pool in chronically HBV infected individuals.

26949444	CRISPR/Cas9 nuclease systems can create double-stranded DNA breaks at specific sequences to efficiently and precisely disrupt, excise, mutate, insert, or replace genes. However, human embryonic stem or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are more difficult to transfect and less resilient to DNA damage than immortalized tumor cell lines. Here, we describe an optimized protocol for genome engineering of human iPSCs using a simple transient transfection of plasmids and/or single-stranded oligonucleotides. With this protocol, we achieve transfection efficiencies greater than 60%, with gene disruption efficiencies from 1-25% and gene insertion/replacement efficiencies from 0.5-10% without any further selection or enrichment steps. We also describe how to design and assess optimal sgRNA target sites and donor targeting vectors; cloning individual iPSC by single cell FACS sorting, and genotyping successfully edited cells.

25549070	The prokaryotic clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) 9 system may be re-purposed for site-specific eukaryotic genome engineering. CRISPR/Cas9 is an inexpensive, facile, and efficient genome editing tool that allows genetic perturbation of genes and genetic elements. Here we present a simple methodology for CRISPR design, cloning, and delivery for the production of genomic deletions. In addition, we describe techniques for deletion, identification, and characterization. This strategy relies on cellular delivery of a pair of chimeric single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) to create two double strand breaks (DSBs) at a locus in order to delete the intervening DNA segment by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair. Deletions have potential advantages as compared to single-site small indels given the efficiency of biallelic modification, ease of rapid identification by PCR, predictability of loss-of-function, and utility for the study of non-coding elements. This approach can be used for efficient loss-of-function studies of genes and genetic elements in mammalian cell lines.	DE Bauer|MC Canver|SH Orkin
25547186	Cyanothece sp. PCC 7822 is an excellent cyanobacterial model organism with great potential to be applied as a biocatalyst for the production of high value compounds. Like other unicellular diazotrophic cyanobacterial species, it has a tightly regulated metabolism synchronized to the light-dark cycle. Utilizing transcriptomic and proteomic methods, we quantified the relationships between transcription and translation underlying central and secondary metabolism in response to nitrogen free, 12 hour light and 12 hour dark conditions.	By combining mass-spectrometry based proteomics and RNA-sequencing transcriptomics, we quantitatively measured a total of 6766 mRNAs and 1322 proteins at four time points across a 24 hour light-dark cycle. Photosynthesis, nitrogen fixation, and carbon storage relevant genes were expressed during the preceding light or dark period, concurrent with measured nitrogenase activity in the late light period. We describe many instances of disparity in peak mRNA and protein abundances, and strong correlation of light dependent expression of both antisense and CRISPR-related gene expression. The proteins for nitrogenase and the pentose phosphate pathway were highest in the dark, whereas those for glycolysis and the TCA cycle were more prominent in the light. Interestingly, one copy of the psbA gene encoding the photosystem II (PSII) reaction center protein D1 (psbA4) was highly upregulated only in the dark. This protein likely cannot catalyze O2 evolution and so may be used by the cell to keep PSII intact during N2 fixation. The CRISPR elements were found exclusively at the ends of the large plasmid and we speculate that their presence is crucial to the maintenance of this plasmid.	This investigation of parallel transcriptional and translational activity within Cyanothece sp. PCC 7822 provided quantitative information on expression levels of metabolic pathways relevant to engineering efforts. The identification of expression patterns for both mRNA and protein affords a basis for improving biofuel production in this strain and for further genetic manipulations. Expression analysis of the genes encoded on the 6 plasmids provided insight into the possible acquisition and maintenance of some of these extra-chromosomal elements.

25545896	Genome engineering with designer nucleases is a rapidly progressing field, and the ability to correct human gene mutations in situ is highly desirable. We employed fibroblasts derived from a patient with Fanconi anemia as a model to test the ability of the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/Cas9 nuclease system to mediate gene correction. We show that the Cas9 nuclease and nickase each resulted in gene correction, but the nickase, because of its ability to preferentially mediate homology-directed repair, resulted in a higher frequency of corrected clonal isolates. To assess the off-target effects, we used both a predictive software platform to identify intragenic sequences of homology as well as a genome-wide screen utilizing linear amplification-mediated PCR. We observed no off-target activity and show RNA-guided endonuclease candidate sites that do not possess low sequence complexity function in a highly specific manner. Collectively, we provide proof of principle for precision genome editing in Fanconi anemia, a DNA repair-deficient human disorder.

25535830	Translocator protein (TSPO) is a mitochondrial outer membrane protein of unknown function with high physiological expression in steroidogenic cells. Using TSPO gene-deleted mice, we recently demonstrated that TSPO function is not essential for steroidogenesis. The first link between TSPO and steroidogenesis was established in studies showing modest increases in progesterone production by adrenocortical and Leydig tumor cell lines after treatment with PK11195. To reconcile discrepancies between physiological and pharmacological interpretations of TSPO function, we generated TSPO-knockout MA-10 mouse Leydig tumor cells (MA-10:TspoΔ/Δ) and examined their steroidogenic potential after exposure to either dibutyryl-cAMP or PK11195. Progesterone production in MA-10:TspoΔ/Δ after dibutyryl-cAMP was not different from control MA-10:Tspo+/+ cells, confirming that TSPO function is not essential for steroidogenesis. Interestingly, when treated with increasing concentrations of PK11195, both control MA-10:Tspo+/+ cells and MA-10:TspoΔ/Δ cells responded in a similar dose-dependent manner showing increases in progesterone production. These results show that the pharmacological effect of PK11195 on steroidogenesis is not mediated through TSPO.	LN Tu|AH Zhao|DM Stocco|V Selvaraj

25529990	The discovery and application of the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing method has greatly enhanced the ease with which transgenic manipulation can occur. We applied this technology to the mollusc, Crepidula fornicata, and have successfully created transgenic embryos expressing mCherry fused to endogenous β-catenin. Specific integration of the fluorescent reporter was achieved by homologous recombination with a β-catenin-specific donor DNA containing the mCherry coding sequence. This fluorescent gene knock-in strategy permits in vivo observations of β-catenin expression during embryonic development and represents the first demonstration of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated transgenesis in the Lophotrochozoa superphylum. The CRISPR/Cas9 method is a powerful and economical tool for genome modification and presents an option for analysis of gene expression in not only major model systems, but also in those more diverse species that may not have been amenable to the classic methods of transgenesis. This approach will allow one to generate transgenic lines of snails for future studies.	KJ Perry|JQ Henry

In this study, we developed a standardized toolkit utilizing an engineered CRISPR/Cas9 system that enables customizable gene regulation in mammalian cells.

25518728	Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a Gram-negative halophilic bacterium. Infections with the bacterium could become systemic and can be life-threatening to immunocompromised individuals. Genome sequences of a few clinical isolates of V. parahaemolyticus are currently available, but the genome dynamics across the species and virulence potential of environmental strains on a genome-scale have not been described before.	Here we present genome sequences of four V. parahaemolyticus clinical strains from stool samples of patients and five environmental strains in Hong Kong. Phylogenomics analysis based on single nucleotide polymorphisms revealed a clear distinction between the clinical and environmental isolates. A new gene cluster belonging to the biofilm associated proteins of V. parahaemolyticus was found in clincial strains. In addition, a novel small genomic island frequently found among clinical isolates was reported. A few environmental strains were found harboring virulence genes and prophage elements, indicating their virulence potential. A unique biphenyl degradation pathway was also reported. A database for V. parahaemolyticus (http://kwanlab.bio.cuhk.edu.hk/vp) was constructed here as a platform to access and analyze genome sequences and annotations of the bacterium.	We have performed a comparative genomics analysis of clinical and environmental strains of V. parahaemolyticus. Our analyses could facilitate understanding of the phylogenetic diversity and niche adaptation of this bacterium.	L Li|HC Wong|W Nong|MK Cheung|PT Law|KM Kam|HS Kwan

25517468	Genome editing via CRISPR/Cas9 has rapidly become the tool of choice by virtue of its efficacy and ease of use. However, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing in clinically relevant human somatic cells remains untested. Here, we report CRISPR/Cas9 targeting of two clinically relevant genes, B2M and CCR5, in primary human CD4+ T cells and CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Use of single RNA guides led to highly efficient mutagenesis in HSPCs but not in T cells. A dual guide approach improved gene deletion efficacy in both cell types. HSPCs that had undergone genome editing with CRISPR/Cas9 retained multilineage potential. We examined predicted on- and off-target mutations via target capture sequencing in HSPCs and observed low levels of off-target mutagenesis at only one site. These results demonstrate that CRISPR/Cas9 can efficiently ablate genes in HSPCs with minimal off-target mutagenesis, which could have broad applicability for hematopoietic cell-based therapy.

25515769	Cyanobacteria have played a crucial role in the history of early earth and continue to be instrumental in shaping our planet, yet applications of cutting edge technology have not yet been widely used to explore cyanobacterial diversity. To provide adequate background, we briefly review current sequencing technologies and their innovative uses in genomics and metagenomics. Next, we focus on current cell capture technologies and the challenges of using them with cyanobacteria. We illustrate the utility in coupling breakthroughs in DNA amplification with cell capture platforms, with an example of microfluidic isolation and subsequent targeted amplicon sequencing from individual terrestrial thermophilic cyanobacteria. Single cells of thermophilic, unicellular Synechococcus sp. JA-2-3-B'a(2-13) (Syn OS-B') were sorted in a microfluidic device, lysed, and subjected to whole genome amplification by multiple displacement amplification. We amplified regions from specific CRISPR spacer arrays, which are known to be highly diverse, contain semi-palindromic repeats which form secondary structure, and can be difficult to amplify. Cell capture, lysis, and genome amplification on a microfluidic device have been optimized, setting a stage for further investigations of individual cyanobacterial cells isolated directly from natural populations.

25512373	The prokaryotic immune system CRISPR-Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-CRISPR-associated) is a defense system that protects prokaryotes against foreign DNA. The short CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) are central components of this immune system. In CRISPR-Cas systems type I and III, crRNAs are generated by the endonuclease Cas6. We developed a Cas6b-independent crRNA maturation pathway for the Haloferax type I-B system in vivo that expresses a functional crRNA, which we termed independently generated crRNA (icrRNA). The icrRNA is effective in triggering degradation of an invader plasmid carrying the matching protospacer sequence. The Cas6b-independent maturation of the icrRNA allowed mutation of the repeat sequence without interfering with signals important for Cas6b processing. We generated 23 variants of the icrRNA and analyzed them for activity in the interference reaction. icrRNAs with deletions or mutations of the 3' handle are still active in triggering an interference reaction. The complete 3' handle could be removed without loss of activity. However, manipulations of the 5' handle mostly led to loss of interference activity. Furthermore, we could show that in the presence of an icrRNA a strain without Cas6b (Δcas6b) is still active in interference.	LK Maier|AE Stachler|SJ Saunders|R Backofen|A Marchfelder
25505143	CRISPR-Cas systems provide a small RNA-based mechanism to defend against invasive genetic elements in archaea and bacteria. To investigate the in vivo mechanism of RNA interference by two type III-B systems (Cmr-α and Cmr-β) in Sulfolobus islandicus, a genetic assay was developed using plasmids carrying an artificial mini-CRISPR (AC) locus with a single spacer. After pAC plasmids were introduced into different strains, Northern analyses confirmed that mature crRNAs were produced from the plasmid-borne CRISPR loci, which then guided gene silencing to target gene expression. Spacer mutagenesis identified a trinucleotide sequence in the 3'-region of crRNA that was crucial for RNA interference. Studying mutants lacking Cmr-α or Cmr-β system showed that each Cmr complex exhibited RNA interference. Strikingly, these analyses further revealed that the two Cmr systems displayed distinctive interference features. Whereas Cmr-β complexes targeted transcripts and could be recycled in RNA cleavage, Cmr-α complexes probably targeted nascent RNA transcripts and remained associated with the substrate. Moreover, Cmr-β exhibited much stronger RNA cleavage activity than Cmr-α. Since we previously showed that S. islandicus Cmr-α mediated transcription-dependent DNA interference, the Cmr-α constitutes the first CRISPR system exhibiting dual targeting of RNA and DNA.

25503746	With the goal to generate and characterize the phenotypes of null alleles in all genes within an organism and the recent advances in custom nucleases, genome editing limitations have moved from mutation generation to mutation detection. We previously demonstrated that High Resolution Melting (HRM) analysis is a rapid and efficient means of genotyping known zebrafish mutants. Here we establish optimized conditions for HRM based detection of novel mutant alleles. Using these conditions, we demonstrate that HRM is highly efficient at mutation detection across multiple genome editing platforms (ZFNs, TALENs, and CRISPRs); we observed nuclease generated HRM positive targeting in 1 of 6 (16%) open pool derived ZFNs, 14 of 23 (60%) TALENs, and 58 of 77 (75%) CRISPR nucleases. Successful targeting, based on HRM of G0 embryos correlates well with successful germline transmission (46 of 47 nucleases); yet, surprisingly mutations in the somatic tail DNA weakly correlate with mutations in the germline F1 progeny DNA. This suggests that analysis of G0 tail DNA is a good indicator of the efficiency of the nuclease, but not necessarily a good indicator of germline alleles that will be present in the F1s. However, we demonstrate that small amplicon HRM curve profiles of F1 progeny DNA can be used to differentiate between specific mutant alleles, facilitating rare allele identification and isolation; and that HRM is a powerful technique for screening possible off-target mutations that may be generated by the nucleases. Our data suggest that micro-homology based alternative NHEJ repair is primarily utilized in the generation of CRISPR mutant alleles and allows us to predict likelihood of generating a null allele. Lastly, we demonstrate that HRM can be used to quickly distinguish genotype-phenotype correlations within F1 embryos derived from G0 intercrosses. Together these data indicate that custom nucleases, in conjunction with the ease and speed of HRM, will facilitate future high-throughput mutation generation and analysis needed to establish mutants in all genes of an organism.

25502645	The CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas9 (CRISPR-associated 9) system is a highly efficient and powerful tool for RNA-guided editing of the cellular genome. Whether CRISPR/Cas9 can also cleave the genome of DNA viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which undergo episomal replication in human cells, remains to be established. Here, we reported on CRISPR/Cas9-mediated editing of the EBV genome in human cells. Two guide RNAs (gRNAs) were used to direct a targeted deletion of 558 bp in the promoter region of BART (BamHI A rightward transcript) which encodes viral microRNAs (miRNAs). Targeted editing was achieved in several human epithelial cell lines latently infected with EBV, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma C666-1 cells. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated editing of the EBV genome was efficient. A recombinant virus with the desired deletion was obtained after puromycin selection of cells expressing Cas9 and gRNAs. No off-target cleavage was found by deep sequencing. The loss of BART miRNA expression and activity was verified, supporting the BART promoter as the major promoter of BART RNA. Although CRISPR/Cas9-mediated editing of the multicopy episome of EBV in infected HEK293 cells was mostly incomplete, viruses could be recovered and introduced into other cells at low m.o.i. Recombinant viruses with an edited genome could be further isolated through single-cell sorting. Finally, a DsRed selectable marker was successfully introduced into the EBV genome during the course of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated editing. Taken together, our work provided not only the first genetic evidence that the BART promoter drives the expression of the BART transcript, but also a new and efficient method for targeted editing of EBV genome in human cells.

25497837	The CRISPR/Cas9 system is a robust genome editing technology that works in human cells, animals and plants based on the RNA-programmed DNA cleaving activity of the Cas9 enzyme. Building on previous work (Jinek et al., 2013), we show here that new genetic information can be introduced site-specifically and with high efficiency by homology-directed repair (HDR) of Cas9-induced site-specific double-strand DNA breaks using timed delivery of Cas9-guide RNA ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes. Cas9 RNP-mediated HDR in HEK293T, human primary neonatal fibroblast and human embryonic stem cells was increased dramatically relative to experiments in unsynchronized cells, with rates of HDR up to 38% observed in HEK293T cells. Sequencing of on- and potential off-target sites showed that editing occurred with high fidelity, while cell mortality was minimized. This approach provides a simple and highly effective strategy for enhancing site-specific genome engineering in both transformed and primary human cells.	S Lin|BT Staahl|RK Alla|JA Doudna
25494202	Systematic interrogation of gene function requires the ability to perturb gene expression in a robust and generalizable manner. Here we describe structure-guided engineering of a CRISPR-Cas9 complex to mediate efficient transcriptional activation at endogenous genomic loci. We used these engineered Cas9 activation complexes to investigate single-guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting rules for effective transcriptional activation, to demonstrate multiplexed activation of ten genes simultaneously, and to upregulate long intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA) transcripts. We also synthesized a library consisting of 70,290 guides targeting all human RefSeq coding isoforms to screen for genes that, upon activation, confer resistance to a BRAF inhibitor. The top hits included genes previously shown to be able to confer resistance, and novel candidates were validated using individual sgRNA and complementary DNA overexpression. A gene expression signature based on the top screening hits correlated with markers of BRAF inhibitor resistance in cell lines and patient-derived samples. These results collectively demonstrate the potential of Cas9-based activators as a powerful genetic perturbation technology.

25488301	CRISPR-Cas systems provide adaptive microbial immunity against invading viruses and plasmids. The cariogenic bacterium Streptococcus mutans UA159 has two CRISPR-Cas systems: CRISPR1 (type II-A) and CRISPR2 (type I-C) with several spacers from both CRISPR cassettes matching sequences of phage M102 or genomic sequences of other S. mutans. The deletion of the cas genes of CRISPR1 (ΔC1S), CRISPR2 (ΔC2E), or both CRISPR1+2 (ΔC1SC2E) or the removal of spacers 2 and 3 (ΔCR1SP13E) in S. mutans UA159 did not affect phage sensitivity when challenged with virulent phage M102. Using plasmid transformation experiments, we demonstrated that the CRISPR1-Cas system inhibits transformation of S. mutans by the plasmids matching the spacers 2 and 3. Functional analysis of the cas deletion mutants revealed that in addition to a role in plasmid targeting, both CRISPR systems also contribute to the regulation of bacterial physiology in S. mutans. Compared to wild-type cells, the ΔC1S strain displayed diminished growth under cell membrane and oxidative stress, enhanced growth under low pH, and had reduced survival under heat shock and DNA-damaging conditions, whereas the ΔC2E strain exhibited increased sensitivity to heat shock. Transcriptional analysis revealed that the two-component signal transduction system VicR/K differentially modulates expression of cas genes within CRISPR-Cas systems, suggesting that VicR/K might coordinate the expression of two CRISPR-Cas systems. Collectively, we provide in vivo evidence that the type II-A CRISPR-Cas system of S. mutans may be targeted to manipulate its stress response and to influence the host to control the uptake and dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes.

25486255	The pluripotency of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) is maintained by a small group of master transcription factors including Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog. These core factors form a regulatory circuit controlling the transcription of a number of pluripotency factors including themselves. Although previous studies have identified transcriptional regulators of this core network, the cis-regulatory DNA sequences required for the transcription of these key pluripotency factors remain to be defined. We analyzed epigenomic data within the 1.5 Mb gene-desert regions around the Sox2 gene and identified a 13kb-long super-enhancer (SE) located 100kb downstream of Sox2 in mouse ESCs. This SE is occupied by Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, and the mediator complex, and physically interacts with the Sox2 locus via DNA looping. Using a simple and highly efficient double-CRISPR genome editing strategy we deleted the entire 13-kb SE and characterized transcriptional defects in the resulting monoallelic and biallelic deletion clones with RNA-seq. We showed that the SE is responsible for over 90% of Sox2 expression, and Sox2 is the only target gene along the chromosome. Our results support the functional significance of a SE in maintaining the pluripotency transcription program in mouse ESCs.	Y Li|CM Rivera|H Ishii|F Jin|S Selvaraj|AY Lee|JR Dixon|B Ren
25483036	Upon pathogen invasion, bacteria and archaea activate an RNA-interference-like mechanism termed CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats). A large family of Cas (CRISPR-associated) proteins mediates the different stages of this sophisticated immune response. Bioinformatic studies have classified the Cas proteins into families, according to their sequences and respective functions. These range from the insertion of the foreign genetic elements into the host genome to the activation of the interference machinery as well as target degradation upon attack. Cas7 family proteins are central to the type I and type III interference machineries as they constitute the backbone of the large interference complexes. Here we report the crystal structure of Thermofilum pendens Csc2, a Cas7 family protein of type I-D. We found that Csc2 forms a core RRM-like domain, flanked by three peripheral insertion domains: a lid domain, a Zinc-binding domain and a helical domain. Comparison with other Cas7 family proteins reveals a set of similar structural features both in the core and in the peripheral domains, despite the absence of significant sequence similarity. T. pendens Csc2 binds single-stranded RNA in vitro in a sequence-independent manner. Using a crosslinking - mass-spectrometry approach, we mapped the RNA-binding surface to a positively charged surface patch on T. pendens Csc2. Thus our analysis of the key structural and functional features of T. pendens Csc2 highlights recurring themes and evolutionary relationships in type I and type III Cas proteins.

25482566	The Cmr complex is the multisubunit effector complex of the type III-B clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas immune system. The Cmr complex recognizes a target RNA through base pairing with the integral CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and cleaves the target at multiple regularly spaced locations within the complementary region. To understand the molecular basis of the function of this complex, we have assembled information from electron microscopic and X-ray crystallographic structural studies and mutagenesis of a complete Pyrococcus furiosus Cmr complex. Our findings reveal that four helically packed Cmr4 subunits, which make up the backbone of the Cmr complex, act as a platform to support crRNA binding and target RNA cleavage. Interestingly, we found a hook-like structural feature associated with Cmr4 that is likely the site of target RNA binding and cleavage. Our results also elucidate analogies in the mechanisms of crRNA and target molecule binding by the distinct Cmr type III-A and Cascade type I-E complexes.

25481785	Understanding molecular mechanisms of toxicity is facilitated by experimental manipulations, such as disruption of function by gene targeting, that are especially challenging in non-standard model species with limited genomic resources. While loss-of-function approaches have included gene knock-down using morpholino-modified oligonucleotides and random mutagenesis using mutagens or retroviruses, more recent approaches include targeted mutagenesis using zinc finger nuclease (ZFN), transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALENs) and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 technology. These latter methods provide more accessible opportunities to explore gene function in non-traditional model species. To facilitate evaluation of toxic mechanisms for important categories of aryl hydrocarbon pollutants, whose actions are known to be receptor mediated, we used ZFN and CRISPR-Cas9 approaches to generate aryl hydrocarbon receptor 2a (AHR2a) and AHR2b gene mutations in Atlantic killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) embryos. This killifish is a particularly valuable non-traditional model, with multiple paralogs of AHR whose functions are not well characterized. In addition, some populations of this species have evolved resistance to toxicants such as halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons. AHR-null killifish will be valuable for characterizing the role of the individual AHR paralogs in evolved resistance, as well as in normal development. We first used five-finger ZFNs targeting exons 1 and 3 of AHR2a. Subsequently, CRISPR-Cas9 guide RNAs were designed to target regions in exon 2 and 3 of AHR2a and AHR2b. We successfully induced frameshift mutations in AHR2a exon 3 with ZFN and CRISPR-Cas9 guide RNAs, with mutation frequencies of 10% and 16%, respectively. In AHR2b, mutations were induced using CRISPR-Cas9 guide RNAs targeting sites in both exon 2 (17%) and exon 3 (63%). We screened AHR2b exon 2 CRISPR-Cas9-injected embryos for off-target effects in AHR paralogs. No mutations were observed in closely related AHR genes (AHR1a, AHR1b, AHR2a, AHRR) in the CRISPR-Cas9-injected embryos. Overall, our results demonstrate that targeted genome-editing methods are efficient in inducing mutations at specific loci in embryos of a non-traditional model species, without detectable off-target effects in paralogous genes.

25480015	Lactobacillus crispatus is a ubiquitous micro-organism encountered in a wide range of host-associated habitats. It can be recovered from the gastrointestinal tract of animals and it is a common constituent of the vaginal microbiota of humans. Moreover, L. crispatus can contribute to the urogenital health of the host through competitive exclusion and the production of antimicrobial agents. In order to investigate the genetic diversity of this important urogenital species, we performed a comparative genomic analysis of L. crispatus.	Utilizing the completed genome sequence of a strain ST1 and the draft genome sequences of nine other L. crispatus isolates, we defined the scale and scope of the pan- and core genomic potential of L. crispatus. Our comparative analysis identified 1,224 and 2,705 ortholog groups present in all or only some of the ten strains, respectively. Based on mathematical modeling, sequencing of additional L. crispatus isolates would result in the identification of new genes and functions, whereas the conserved core of the ten strains was a good representation of the final L. crispatus core genome, estimated to level at about 1,116 ortholog groups. Importantly, the current core was observed to encode bacterial components potentially promoting urogenital health. Using antibody fragments specific for one of the conserved L. crispatus adhesins, we demonstrated that the L. crispatus core proteins have a potential to reduce the ability of Gardnerella vaginalis to adhere to epithelial cells. These findings thereby suggest that L. crispatus core proteins could protect the vagina from G. vaginalis and bacterial vaginosis.	Our pan-genome analysis provides insights into the intraspecific genome variability and the collective molecular mechanisms of the species L. crispatus. Using this approach, we described the differences and similarities between the genomes and identified features likely to be important for urogenital health. Notably, the conserved genetic backbone of L. crispatus accounted for close to 60% of the ortholog groups of an average L. crispatus strain and included factors for the competitive exclusion of G. vaginalis, providing an explanation on how this urogenital species could improve vaginal health.

25472545	Acaryochloris marina is a symbiotic species of cyanobacteria that is capable of utilizing far-red light. We report the characterization of the phages A-HIS1 and A-HIS2, capable of infecting Acaryochloris. Morphological characterization of these phages places them in the family Siphoviridae. However, molecular characterization reveals that they do not show genetic similarity with any known siphoviruses. While the phages do show synteny between each other, the nucleotide identity between the phages is low at 45-67%, suggesting they diverged from each other some time ago. The greatest number of genes shared with another phage (a myovirus infecting marine Synechococcus) was four. Unlike most other cyanophages and in common with the Siphoviridae infecting Synechococcus, no photosynthesis-related genes were found in the genome. CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) spacers from the host Acaryochloris had partial matches to sequences found within the phages, which is the first time CRISPRs have been reported in a cyanobacterial/cyanophage system. The phages also encode a homologue of the proteobacterial RNase T. The potential function of RNase T in the mark-up or digestion of crRNA hints at a novel mechanism for evading the host CRISPR system.

25459138	Ischemic heart disease has remained the number one killer around the world for over the past 20 years. While stem cell therapy has become a promising new frontier to repair the damaged heart, limited stem cell survivability post-transplantation has precluded widespread use of this therapy. Strategies to genetically modify stem cells to activate pro-survival and anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory pathways, such as Akt and heme oxygenase-1, have been shown to improve the lifespan of transplanted stem cells within the ischemic myocardium, but constitutive overexpression of these pathways at high levels has been shown to have side effects. Therefore, more specific and controlled gene activation would be necessary. Current techniques used for gene regulation include zinc finger and TALE proteins, but there are still disadvantages to each of these methods, such as ease and cost of use. Also, those methods use synthesized promoters to express synthesized cDNA, which lack regulatory elements, including introns and 3' untranslated regions for microRNA mediated post-transcriptional regulation. A new novel technique, the CRISPR/dCas9 system, was recently developed as a simple and efficient method for endogenous gene regulation. With its use of single guide chimeric RNA's (sgRNA's), this system has been shown to provide a high level of specificity and efficiency. When targeting different loci, past studies have found that the CRISPR/dCas9 system can activate gene expression at varying levels. In addition, this system makes use of the genome's endogenous regulatory elements, such as the aforementioned introns and 3' UTR's, which can help provide a safer method of gene activation. If targeted to a gene promoting cellular survival or decreasing cell death, it could potentially improve stem cell longevity in a more efficient and controllable manner. As a result, our hypothesis is to use the CRISPR/dCas9 system to activate expression of an anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic gene, such as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), to an optimal level to increase transplanted stem cell survival while also mitigating its cytotoxic effects due to lack of internal regulation, thus prolonging its effects within the ischemic myocardium leading to greater therapeutic benefit.

25458845	Immunity against viruses and plasmids provided by CRISPR-Cas systems relies on a ribonucleoprotein effector complex that triggers the degradation of invasive nucleic acids (NA). Effector complexes of type I (Cascade) and II (Cas9-dual RNA) target foreign DNA. Intriguingly, the genetic evidence suggests that the type III-A Csm complex targets DNA, whereas biochemical data show that the type III-B Cmr complex cleaves RNA. Here we aimed to investigate NA specificity and mechanism of CRISPR interference for the Streptococcus thermophilus Csm (III-A) complex (StCsm). When expressed in Escherichia coli, two complexes of different stoichiometry copurified with 40 and 72 nt crRNA species, respectively. Both complexes targeted RNA and generated multiple cuts at 6 nt intervals. The Csm3 protein, present in multiple copies in both Csm complexes, acts as endoribonuclease. In the heterologous E. coli host, StCsm restricts MS2 RNA phage in a Csm3 nuclease-dependent manner. Thus, our results demonstrate that the type III-A StCsm complex guided by crRNA targets RNA and not DNA.	G Tamulaitis|M Kazlauskiene|E Manakova|Č Venclovas|AO Nwokeoji|MJ Dickman|P Horvath|V Siksnys
25457165	CRISPR-Cas is a prokaryotic adaptive immune system that provides sequence-specific defense against foreign nucleic acids. Here we report the structure and function of the effector complex of the Type III-A CRISPR-Cas system of Thermus thermophilus: the Csm complex (TtCsm). TtCsm is composed of five different protein subunits (Csm1-Csm5) with an uneven stoichiometry and a single crRNA of variable size (35-53 nt). The TtCsm crRNA content is similar to the Type III-B Cmr complex, indicating that crRNAs are shared among different subtypes. A negative stain EM structure of the TtCsm complex exhibits the characteristic architecture of Type I and Type III CRISPR-associated ribonucleoprotein complexes. crRNA-protein crosslinking studies show extensive contacts between the Csm3 backbone and the bound crRNA. We show that, like TtCmr, TtCsm cleaves complementary target RNAs at multiple sites. Unlike Type I complexes, interference by TtCsm does not proceed via initial base pairing by a seed sequence.

25456124	Generation of genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) for chromosomal translocations in the endogenous loci by a knockin strategy is lengthy and costly. The CRISPR/Cas9 system provides an innovative and flexible approach for genome engineering of genomic loci in vitro and in vivo. Here, we report the use of the CRISPR/Cas9 system for engineering a specific chromosomal translocation in adult mice in vivo. We designed CRISPR/Cas9 lentiviral vectors to induce cleavage of the murine endogenous Eml4 and Alk loci in order to generate the Eml4-Alk gene rearrangement recurrently found in non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs). Intratracheal or intrapulmonary inoculation of lentiviruses induced Eml4-Alk gene rearrangement in lung cells in vivo. Genomic and mRNA sequencing confirmed the genome editing and the production of the Eml4-Alk fusion transcript. All mice developed Eml4-Alk-rearranged lung tumors 2 months after the inoculation, demonstrating that the CRISPR/Cas9 system is a feasible and simple method for the generation of chromosomal rearrangements in vivo.

25455966	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR), which is considered to be an immune system for bacteria, has been widely used as a tool for genome editing and genotyping. It has also been reported to be associated with virulence factors in some bacteria. To understand the role of CRISPR in the virulence and evolution of pathogenic Vibrio parahaemolyticus, 154 V. parahaemolyticus strains isolated from clinical samples and 54 strains from food samples taken in Shenzhen, China were subjected to a correlation analysis of CRISPR and virulence factors TDH and TRH. We also performed multilocus sequence typing (MLST) for genotype analysis. Six different CRISPR sequence types (CSTs) of V. parahaemolyticus were identified, and CSTs were found to be significantly associated with the virulence factors tested and MLST genotype. Therefore, CSTs provide insight into the evolution of V. parahaemolyticus. Moreover, identification of CSTs may lend insight into the virulence potential of strains.

25451598	Clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) loci play a pivotal role in the prokaryotic host defense system against invading genetic materials. The CRISPR loci are transcribed to produce CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs), which form interference complexes with CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins to target the invading nucleic acid for degradation. The interference complex of the type III-A CRISPR-Cas system is composed of five Cas proteins (Csm1-Csm5) and a crRNA, and targets invading DNA. Here, we show that the Csm1, Csm3, and Csm4 proteins from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii form a stable subcomplex. We also report the crystal structure of the M. jannaschii Csm3-Csm4 subcomplex at 3.1Å resolution. The complex structure revealed the presence of a basic concave surface around their interface, suggesting the RNA and/or DNA binding ability of the complex. A gel retardation analysis showed that the Csm3-Csm4 complex binds single-stranded RNA in a non-sequence-specific manner. Csm4 structurally resembles Cmr3, a component of the type III-B CRISPR-Cas interference complex. Based on bioinformatics, we constructed a model structure of the Csm1-Csm4-Csm3 ternary complex, which provides insights into its role in the Csm interference complex.

These immune systems are conditioned by the production of small CRISPR-derived RNAs matured from long RNA precursors. This often requires a Csy4 endoribonuclease cleaving the RNA 3'-end.	We report extended explicit solvent molecular dynamic (MD) simulations of Csy4/RNA complex in precursor and product states, based on X-ray structures of product and inactivated precursor (55 simulations; ~3.7μs in total).	The simulations identify double-protonated His29 and deprotonated terminal phosphate as the likely dominant protonation states consistent with the product structure. We revealed potential substates consistent with Ser148 and His29 acting as the general base and acid, respectively. The Ser148 could be straightforwardly deprotonated through solvent and could without further structural rearrangements deprotonate the nucleophile, contrasting similar studies investigating the general base role of nucleobases in ribozymes. We could not locate geometries consistent with His29 acting as general base. However, we caution that the X-ray structures do not always capture the catalytically active geometries and then the reactive structures may be unreachable by the simulation technique.	We identified potential catalytic arrangement of the Csy4/RNA complex but we also report limitations of the simulation technique. Even for the dominant protonation state we could not achieve full agreement between the simulations and the structural data.	Potential catalytic arrangement of the Csy4/RNA complex is found. Further, we provide unique insights into limitations of simulations of protein/RNA complexes, namely, the influence of the starting experimental structures and force field limitations. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Recent developments of molecular dynamics.	C Estarellas|M Otyepka|J Koča|P Banáš|M Krepl|J Šponer
25446836	The most commonly used therapies for cancer involve delivering high doses of radiation or toxic chemicals to the patient that also cause substantial damage to normal tissue. To overcome this, researchers have recently resorted to a basic biological concept called 'synthetic lethality' (SL) that takes advantage of interactions between gene pairs. The identification of SL interactions is of considerable therapeutic interest because if a particular gene is SL with a tumor-causing mutation, then the targeting that gene carries therapeutic advantages. Mapping these interactions in the context of human cancer cells could hold the key to effective, targeted cancer treatments. In this review, we cover the recent advances that aim to identify these SL interactions using unbiased genetic screens.	JM Paul|SD Templeton|A Baharani|A Freywald|FJ Vizeacoumar
25445602	Listeria monocytogenes, an important food-borne pathogen, causes high mortality rate of listeriosis. Pan-genomic comparisons revealed the species genome of L. monocytogenes is highly stable but not completely clonal. The population structure of this species displays at least four evolutionary lineages (I-IV). Isolates of different lineages displayed distinct genetic, phenotypic and ecologic characteristics, which appear to affect their ability to be transmitted through foods and to cause human disease, as well as their ability to thrive in markedly phage-rich environments. CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindrome repeats), a recently described adaptive immunity system, not only confers defense against invading elements derived from bacteriophages or plasmids in many bacteria and archaeal, but also displays strains-level variations in almost any given endowed species. This work was aimed to investigate CRISPR diversity in L. monocytogenes strains of different lineages and estimated the potential practicability of the CRISPR-based approach to resolve this species' biodiversity. Only a third of strains contained all three CRISPR loci (here defined as LMa, LMb and LMc) at same time. Combined the strain-level variations in presence/absence of each CRISPR locus and its relative size and spacer arrangements, a total of 29 CRISPR genotypes and 11 groups were defined within a collection of 128 strains covering all serotypes. The CRISPR-based approach showed powerful ability to subtype the more commonly food-borne isolates of serotype 1/2a (lineage II) and serotypes 1/2b (lineage I), but limited by the absence of typical CRISPR structure in many lineage I isolates. Strikingly, we found a long associated cas1 gene as well as two self-targeting LMb spacers accidently homologous with endogenous genes in a fraction of serotype 1/2a isolations, demonstrated that CRISPR I B system might involve in bacterial physiology besides antiviral immunity.

25437637	CRISPR/Cas9 is a rapidly developing genome editing technology that has been successfully applied in many organisms, including model and crop plants. Cas9, an RNA-guided DNA endonuclease, can be targeted to specific genomic sequences by engineering a separately encoded guide RNA with which it forms a complex. As only a short RNA sequence must be synthesized to confer recognition of a new target, CRISPR/Cas9 is a relatively cheap and easy to implement technology that has proven to be extremely versatile. Remarkably, in some plant species, homozygous knockout mutants can be produced in a single generation. Together with other sequence-specific nucleases, CRISPR/Cas9 is a game-changing technology that is poised to revolutionise basic research and plant breeding.

25437567	The CRISPR/Cas9 system has recently emerged as a powerful tool for functional genomic studies in Drosophila melanogaster. However, single-guide RNA (sgRNA) parameters affecting the specificity and efficiency of the system in flies are still not clear. Here, we found that off-target effects did not occur in regions of genomic DNA with three or more nucleotide mismatches to sgRNAs. Importantly, we document for a strong positive correlation between mutagenesis efficiency and sgRNA GC content of the six protospacer-adjacent motif-proximal nucleotides (PAMPNs). Furthermore, by injecting well-designed sgRNA plasmids at the optimal concentration we determined, we could efficiently generate mutations in four genes in one step. Finally, we generated null alleles of HP1a using optimized parameters through homology-directed repair and achieved an overall mutagenesis rate significantly higher than previously reported. Our work demonstrates a comprehensive optimization of sgRNA and promises to vastly simplify CRISPR/Cas9 experiments in Drosophila.

25432744	Common approaches for purification of RNAs synthesized in vitro by the T7 RNA polymerase often denature the RNA and produce RNAs with chemically heterogeneous 5'- and 3'-ends. Thus, native affinity purification strategies that incorporate 5' and 3' trimming technologies provide a solution to two main disadvantages that arise from standard approaches for RNA purification. This chapter describes procedures for nondenaturing affinity purification of in vitro transcribed RNA using a 3'-ARiBo tag, which yield RNAs with a homogeneous 3'-end. The applicability of the method to RNAs of different sequences, secondary structures, and sizes (29-614 nucleotides) is described, including suggestions for troubleshooting common problems. In addition, this chapter presents three complementary approaches to producing 5'-homogeneity of the affinity-purified RNA: (1) selection of the starting sequence; (2) Cse3 endoribonuclease cleavage of a 5'-CRISPR tag; or (3) self-cleavage of a 5'-hammerhead ribozyme tag. The additional steps to express and purify the Cse3 endonuclease are detailed. In light of recent results, the advantages and limitations of current approaches to achieve 5'-homogeneity of affinity-purified RNA are discussed, such that one can select a suitable strategy to purify the RNA of interest.

25430774	The advent of facile genome engineering using the bacterial RNA-guided CRISPR-Cas9 system in animals and plants is transforming biology. We review the history of CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeat) biology from its initial discovery through the elucidation of the CRISPR-Cas9 enzyme mechanism, which has set the stage for remarkable developments using this technology to modify, regulate, or mark genomic loci in a wide variety of cells and organisms from all three domains of life. These results highlight a new era in which genomic manipulation is no longer a bottleneck to experiments, paving the way toward fundamental discoveries in biology, with applications in all branches of biotechnology, as well as strategies for human therapeutics.

25428347	Genetic screens of an unprecedented scale have recently been made possible by the availability of high-complexity libraries of synthetic oligonucleotides designed to mediate either gene knockdown or gene knockout, coupled with next-generation sequencing. However, several sources of random noise and statistical biases complicate the interpretation of the resulting high-throughput data. We developed HiTSelect, a comprehensive analysis pipeline for rigorously selecting screen hits and identifying functionally relevant genes and pathways by addressing off-target effects, controlling for variance in both gene silencing efficiency and sequencing depth of coverage and integrating relevant metadata. We document the superior performance of HiTSelect using data from both genome-wide RNAi and CRISPR/Cas9 screens. HiTSelect is implemented as an open-source package, with a user-friendly interface for data visualization and pathway exploration. Binary executables are available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/hitselect/, and the source code is available at https://github.com/diazlab/HiTSelect.	AA Diaz|H Qin|M Ramalho-Santos|JS Song
25423096	Much less is known about reverse transcriptases (RTs) in prokaryotes than in eukaryotes, with most prokaryotic enzymes still uncharacterized. Two surveys involving BLAST searches for RT genes in prokaryotic genomes revealed the presence of large numbers of diverse, uncharacterized RTs and RT-like sequences. Here, using consistent annotation across all sequenced bacterial species from GenBank and other sources via RAST, available from the PATRIC (Pathogenic Resource Integration Center) platform, we have compiled the data for currently annotated reverse transcriptases from completely sequenced bacterial genomes. RT sequences are broadly distributed across bacterial phyla, but green sulfur bacteria and cyanobacteria have the highest levels of RT sequence diversity (≤85% identity) per genome. By contrast, phylum Actinobacteria, for which a large number of genomes have been sequenced, was found to have a low RT sequence diversity. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that bacterial RTs could be classified into 17 main groups: group II introns, retrons/retron-like RTs, diversity-generating retroelements (DGRs), Abi-like RTs, CRISPR-Cas-associated RTs, group II-like RTs (G2L), and 11 other groups of RTs of unknown function. Proteobacteria had the highest potential functional diversity, as they possessed most of the RT groups. Group II introns and DGRs were the most widely distributed RTs in bacterial phyla. Our results provide insights into bacterial RT phylogeny and the basis for an update of annotation systems based on sequence/domain homology.	N Toro|R Nisa-Martínez
25420472	The Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated (Cas) defense system is the only adaptive and inheritable immunity found in prokaryotes. The immunity is achieved through a multistep process of adaptation, expression, and interference. In the Type I-E system, interference is mediated by the CRISPR-associated complex for antiviral defense (Cascade), which recognizes invading double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) through the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) by one of the Cascade components, Cse1. Here, we report the crystal structure of Thermobifida fusca Cse1 at 3.3 Å resolution. T. fusca Cse1 reveals the chair-like two-domain architecture with a well-defined flexible loop, L1, located at the larger N-terminal domain, which was not observed in previous structures of the single Cse1 protein. Structure-based mutagenesis analysis demonstrates that the well-defined flexible loop and a partially conserved structural motif ([FW]-X-[TH]) are involved in PAM binding and recognition, respectively. Moreover, structural docking of T. fusca Cse1 into Escherichia coli Cascade cryoelectron microscopy maps, coupled with structural comparison, reveals a conserved positive patch that is contiguous with Cse2 in the Cascade complex and adjacent to the Cas3 binding site, suggesting its role in R-loop formation/stabilization and the recruitment of Cas3 for target cleavage. Consistent with the structural observation, the introduction of alanine mutations at this positive patch abolished DNA binding activity by Cse1. Taken together, these results suggest that Cse1 is a critical Cascade component involved in Cascade assembly, dsDNA target recognition, R-loop formation, and Cas3 recruitment for target cleavage.

25418680	Efficient and precise genome editing is crucial for realizing the full research and therapeutic potential of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Engineered nucleases including CRISPR/Cas9 and transcription activator like effector nucleases (TALENs) provide powerful tools for enhancing gene-targeting efficiency. In this study, we investigated the relative efficiencies of CRISPR/Cas9 and TALENs in human iPSC lines for inducing both homologous donor-based precise genome editing and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ)-mediated gene disruption. Significantly higher frequencies of NHEJ-mediated insertions/deletions were detected at several endogenous loci using CRISPR/Cas9 than using TALENs, especially at nonexpressed targets in iPSCs. In contrast, comparable efficiencies of inducing homologous donor-based genome editing were observed at disease-associated loci in iPSCs. In addition, we investigated the specificity of guide RNAs used in the CRISPR/Cas9 system in targeting disease-associated point mutations in patient-specific iPSCs. Using myeloproliferative neoplasm patient-derived iPSCs that carry an acquired JAK2-V617F point mutation and α1-antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency patient-derived iPSCs that carry an inherited Z-AAT point mutation, we demonstrate that Cas9 can specifically target either the mutant or the wild-type allele with little disruption at the other allele differing by a single nucleotide. Overall, our results demonstrate the advantages of the CRISPR/Cas9 system in allele-specific genome targeting and in NHEJ-mediated gene disruption.

25417547	Non-bilaterian phyla represent key lineages for exploring the evolutionary history of early animals. However, despite an increasing number of sequenced genomes from early-branching metazoans, efficient and reproducible methodologies for analysis of gene function remain a major challenge. Here we report the utilization of the TALEN and CRISPR/Cas9 systems to induce targeted mutations and homologous recombination-mediated transgenesis in the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis. We also present a new method to isolate genetically modified animals using engineered selection cassettes introduced by homologous recombination. Taken together, these methods will permit sophisticated gain- and loss-of-function analyses in Nematostella and perhaps other early metazoan species that allow for zygotic injection.

25414344	The CRISPR/Cas has been recently shown to be a powerful genome-editing tool in a variety of organisms. However, these studies are mainly focused on protein-coding genes. The present study aims to determine whether this technology can be applied to non-coding genes. One of the challenges for knockout of non-coding genes is that a small deletion or insertion generated by the standard CRISPR/Cas system may not necessarily lead to functional loss of a given non-coding gene because of lacking an open reading frame, especially in polyploidy human cell lines. To overcome this challenge, we adopt a selection system that allows for marker genes to integrate into the genome through homologous recombination (HR). Moreover, we construct a dual guide RNA vector that can make two cuts simultaneously at designated sites such that a large fragment can be deleted. With these approaches, we are able to successfully generate knockouts for miR-21, miR-29a, lncRNA-21A, UCA1 and AK023948 in various human cell lines. Finally, we show that the HR-mediated targeting efficiency can be further improved by suppression of the non-homologous end joining pathway. Together, these results demonstrate the feasibility of knockout for non-coding genes by the CRISPR/Cas system in human cell lines.	TT Ho|N Zhou|J Huang|P Koirala|M Xu|R Fung|F Wu|YY Mo
25414332	Sequence-specific nucleases such as TALEN and the CRISPR/Cas9 system have so far been used to disrupt, correct or insert transgenes at precise locations in mammalian genomes. We demonstrate efficient 'knock-in' targeted replacement of multi-kilobase genes in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC). Using a model system replacing endogenous human genes with their mouse counterpart, we performed a comprehensive study of targeting vector design parameters for homologous recombination. A 2.7 kilobase (kb) homozygous gene replacement was achieved in up to 11% of iPSC without selection. The optimal homology arm length was around 2 kb, with homology length being especially critical on the arm not adjacent to the cut site. Homologous sequence inside the cut sites was detrimental to targeting efficiency, consistent with a synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA) mechanism. Using two nuclease sites, we observed a high degree of gene excisions and inversions, which sometimes occurred more frequently than indel mutations. While homozygous deletions of 86 kb were achieved with up to 8% frequency, deletion frequencies were not solely a function of nuclease activity and deletion size. Our results analyzing the optimal parameters for targeting vector design will inform future gene targeting efforts involving multi-kilobase gene segments, particularly in human iPSC.

25412680	Typhoid fever is an infectious disease of global importance that is caused by Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi). This disease causes an estimated 200,000 deaths per year and remains a serious global health threat. S. Typhi is strictly a human pathogen, and some recovered individuals become long-term carriers who continue to shed the bacteria in their faeces, thus becoming main reservoirs of infection.	A comparative genomics analysis combined with a phylogenomic analysis revealed that the strains from the outbreak and carrier were closely related with microvariations and possibly derived from a common ancestor. Additionally, the comparative genomics analysis with all of the other completely sequenced S. Typhi genomes revealed that strains BL196 and CR0044 exhibit unusual genomic variations despite S. Typhi being generally regarded as highly clonal. The two genomes shared distinct chromosomal architectures and uncommon genome features; notably, the presence of a ~10 kb novel genomic island containing uncharacterised virulence-related genes, and zot in particular. Variations were also detected in the T6SS system and genes that were related to SPI-10, insertion sequences, CRISPRs and nsSNPs among the studied genomes. Interestingly, the carrier strain CR0044 harboured far more genetic polymorphisms (83% mutant nsSNPs) compared with the closely related BL196 outbreak strain. Notably, the two highly related virulence-determinant genes, rpoS and tviE, were mutated in strains BL196 and CR0044, respectively, which revealed that the mutation in rpoS is stabilising, while that in tviE is destabilising. These microvariations provide novel insight into the optimisation of genes by the pathogens. However, the sporadic strain was found to be far more conserved compared with the others.	The uncommon genomic variations in the two closely related BL196 and CR0044 strains suggests that S. Typhi is more diverse than previously thought. Our study has demonstrated that the pathogen is continually acquiring new genes through horizontal gene transfer in the process of host adaptation, providing novel insight into its unusual genomic dynamics. The understanding of these strains and virulence factors, and particularly the strain that is associated with the large outbreak and the less studied asymptomatic Typhi carrier in the population, will have important impact on disease control.

25411954	Loss-of-function (LOF) experiments targeting multiple genes during tumorigenesis can be implemented using pooled shRNA libraries. RNAi screens in animal models rely on the use of multiple shRNAs to simultaneously disrupt gene function, as well as to serve as barcodes for cell fate outcomes during tumorigenesis. Here we provide a protocol for performing RNAi screens in orthotopic mouse tumor models, referring to glioma and lung adenocarcinoma as specific examples. The protocol aims to provide guidelines for applying RNAi to a diverse spectrum of solid tumors and to highlight crucial considerations when designing and performing these studies. It covers shRNA library assembly and packaging into lentiviral particles, and transduction into tumor-initiating cells (TICs), followed by in vivo transplantation, tumor DNA recovery, sequencing and analysis. Depending on the target genes and tumor model, tumor suppressors and oncogenes can be identified or biological pathways can be dissected in 6-9 weeks.

25411213	The introduction of engineered site-specific DNA endonucleases has brought precise genome editing in many model organisms and human cells into the realm of possibility. In zebrafish, loss-of-function alleles have been successfully produced; however, germ line transmission of functional targeted knock-ins of protein tags or of SNP exchanges have not been reported. Here we show by phenotypic rescue that the CRISPR/Cas system can be used to target and repair a premature stop codon at the albino (alb) locus in zebrafish with high efficiency and precision. Using circular donor DNA containing CRISPR target sites we obtain close to 50% of larvae with precise homology-directed repair of the alb(b4) mutation, a small fraction of which transmitted the repaired allele in the germ line to the next generation (3/28 adult fish). The in vivo demonstration of germ line transmission of a precise SNP exchange in zebrafish underscores its suitability as a model for genetic research.	U Irion|J Krauss|C Nüsslein-Volhard
25409604	The discovery of RNA interference (RNAi) in mammalian cells has created a new class of therapeutics based on the reversible silencing of specific disease-causing genes. This therapeutic potential depends on the ability to deliver inducers of RNAi, such as short-interfering RNA (siRNA) and micro-RNA (miRNA), to cells of target tissues. This chapter reviews various challenges and delivery strategies for siRNA, with a particular focus on the development of lipid nanoparticle (LNP) delivery technologies. Currently, LNP delivery systems are the most advanced technology for systemic delivery of siRNA, with numerous formulations under various stages of clinical trials. We also discuss methods to improve gene silencing potency of LNP-siRNA, as well as application of LNP technologies beyond siRNA to the encapsulation of other nucleic acids such as mRNA and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR).

25408407	The Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 system is an adaptive immune system that exists in a variety of microbes. It could be engineered to function in eukaryotic cells as a fast, low-cost, efficient, and scalable tool for manipulating genomic sequences. In this chapter, detailed protocols are described for harnessing the CRISPR-Cas9 system from Streptococcus pyogenes to enable RNA-guided genome engineering applications in mammalian cells. We present all relevant methods including the initial site selection, molecular cloning, delivery of guide RNAs (gRNAs) and Cas9 into mammalian cells, verification of target cleavage, and assays for detecting genomic modification including indels and homologous recombination. These tools provide researchers with new instruments that accelerate both forward and reverse genetics efforts.	L Cong|F Zhang
25403732	Custom-designed nucleases can enable precise plant genome editing by catalyzing DNA-breakage at specific targets to stimulate targeted mutagenesis or gene replacement. The CRISPR-Cas system, with its target-specifying RNA molecule to direct the Cas9 nuclease, is a recent addition to existing nucleases that bind and cleave the target through linked protein domains (e.g. TALENs and zinc-finger nucleases). We have conducted a comparative study of these different types of custom-designed nucleases and we have assessed various components of the CRISPR-Cas system. For this purpose, we have adapted our previously reported assay for cleavage-dependent luciferase gene correction in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves (Johnson et al. in Plant Mol Biol 82(3):207-221, 2013). We found that cleavage by CRISPR-Cas was more efficient than cleavage of the same target by TALENs. We also compared the cleavage efficiency of the Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 protein based on expression using three different Cas9 gene variants. We found significant differences in cleavage efficiency between these variants, with human and Arabidopsis thaliana codon-optimized genes having the highest cleavage efficiencies. We compared the activity of 12 de novo-designed single synthetic guide RNA (sgRNA) constructs, and found their cleavage efficiency varied drastically when using the same Cas9 nuclease. Finally, we show that, for one of the targets tested with our assay, we could induce a germinally-transmitted deletion in a repeat array in A. thaliana. This work emphasizes the efficiency of the CRISPR-Cas system in plants. It also shows that further work is needed to be able to predict the optimal design of sgRNAs or Cas9 variants.

25400128	Targeted genomic regulation is a powerful approach to accelerate trait discovery and development in agricultural biotechnology. Bacteria and archaea use clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) regulatory systems for adaptive molecular immunity against foreign nucleic acids introduced by invading phages and conjugative plasmids. The type II CRISPR/Cas system has been adapted for genome editing in many cell types and organisms. A recent study used the catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9) protein combined with guide-RNAs (gRNAs) as a DNA-targeting platform to modulate gene expression in bacterial, yeast, and human cells. Here, we modified this DNA-targeting platform for targeted transcriptional regulation in planta by developing chimeric dCas9-based transcriptional activators and repressors. To generate transcriptional activators, we fused the dCas9 C-terminus with the activation domains of EDLL and TAL effectors. To generate a transcriptional repressor, we fused the dCas9 C-terminus with the SRDX repression domain. Our data demonstrate that dCas9 fusion with the EDLL activation domain (dCas9:EDLL) and the TAL activation domain (dCas9:TAD), guided by gRNAs complementary to selected promoter elements, induce strong transcriptional activation on Bs3::uidA targets in plant cells. Further, the dCas9:SRDX-mediated transcriptional repression of an endogenous gene. Thus, our results suggest that the synthetic transcriptional repressor (dCas9:SRDX) and activators (dCas9:EDLL and dCas9:TAD) can be used as endogenous transcription factors to repress or activate transcription of an endogenous genomic target. Our data indicate that the CRISPR/dCas9 DNA-targeting platform can be used in plants as a functional genomics tool and for biotechnological applications.

25399110	Typical CRISPR (clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeat) regions are constituted by short direct repeats (DRs), interspersed with similarly sized non-repetitive spacers, derived from transmissible genetic elements, acquired when the cell is challenged with foreign DNA. The analysis of the structure, in number and nature, of CRISPR spacers is a valuable tool for molecular typing since these loci are polymorphic among strains, originating characteristic signatures. The existence of CRISPR structures in the genome of the members of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) enabled the development of a genotyping method, based on the analysis of the presence or absence of 43 oligonucleotide spacers separated by conserved DRs. This method, called spoligotyping, consists on PCR amplification of the DR chromosomal region and recognition after hybridization of the spacers that are present. The workflow beneath this methodology implies that the PCR products are brought onto a membrane containing synthetic oligonucleotides that have complementary sequences to the spacer sequences. Lack of hybridization of the PCR products to a specific oligonucleotide sequence indicates absence of the correspondent spacer sequence in the examined strain. Spoligotyping gained great notoriety as a robust identification and typing tool for members of MTBC, enabling multiple epidemiological studies on human and animal tuberculosis.

25398354	Global demand has driven the use of industrial strains of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae for large-scale production of biofuels and renewable chemicals. However, the genetic basis of desired domestication traits is poorly understood because robust genetic tools do not exist for industrial hosts. We present an efficient, marker-free, high-throughput, and multiplexed genome editing platform for industrial strains of S. cerevisiae that uses plasmid-based expression of the CRISPR/Cas9 endonuclease and multiple ribozyme-protected single guide RNAs. With this multiplex CRISPR (CRISPRm) system, it is possible to integrate DNA libraries into the chromosome for evolution experiments, and to engineer multiple loci simultaneously. The CRISPRm tools should therefore find use in many higher-order synthetic biology applications to accelerate improvements in industrial microorganisms.	OW Ryan|JH Cate
25398352	Genome modification by CRISPR/Cas offers its users the ability to target endogenous sites in the genome for cleavage and for engineering precise genomic changes using template-directed repair, all with unprecedented ease and flexibility of targeting. As such, CRISPR/Cas is just part of a set of recently developed and rapidly improving tools that offer great potential for researchers to functionally access the genomes of organisms that have not previously been extensively used in a laboratory setting. We describe in detail protocols for using CRISPR/Cas to target genes of experimental organisms, in a manner that does not require transformation to obtain transgenic lines and that should be readily applicable to a wide range of previously little-studied species.

25398348	In addition to their applications in genome editing and gene expression regulation, programmable DNA recognition systems, including both CRISPR and TALE, have been recently engineered for the visualization of endogenous genomic elements in living cells. This capability greatly helps the study of genome function regulation by its physical organization and interaction with other nuclear structures. This chapter first discusses the general considerations in designing and implementing the imaging system. The subsequent sections provide detailed protocols to use the CRISPR/Cas9 system to label and image specific genomic loci, including the establishment of expression systems for dCas9-GFP and sgRNA, the procedure to label repetitive sequences of telomeres and protein-coding genes, the simultaneous expression of many sgRNAs to label a nonrepetitive locus, and the verification of signal specificity by FISH.

25398347	CRISPR/Cas-mediated genome modification has opened a new era for elucidating gene function. Gene knockout mice can be generated by injecting humanized Cas9 (hCas9) mRNA and guide RNA (sgRNA) into fertilized eggs. However, delivery of RNA instead of DNA to the fertilized oocyte requires extra preparation and extra care with storage. To simplify the method of delivery, we injected the circular pX330 plasmids expressing both hCas9 and sgRNA and found that mutant mice were generated as efficiently as with RNA injection. Different from the linearized plasmid, the circular plasmid decreased the chance of integration into the host genome. We also developed the pCAG-EGxxFP reporter plasmid for evaluating the sgRNA activity by observing EGFP fluorescence in HEK293T cells. The combination of these techniques allowed us to develop a rapid, easy, and reproducible strategy for targeted mutagenesis in living mice. This chapter provides an experimental protocol for the design of sgRNAs, the construction of pX330-sgRNA and pCAG-EGxxFP-target plasmids, the validation of cleavage efficiency in vitro, and the generation of targeted gene mutant mice. These mice can be generated within a month.	Y Fujihara|M Ikawa
25398346	The laboratory rat is a valuable model organism for basic biological studies and drug development. However, due to the lack of genetic tools for site-specific genetic modification in the rat genome, more and more researchers chose the mouse as their favored mammalian models due to the sophisticated embryonic stem cell-based gene-targeting techniques available. Recently, engineered nucleases, including zinc finger nucleases, transcription activator-like effector nucleases, and CRISPR/Cas9 systems, have been adapted to generate knockout rats efficiently. The purpose of this section is to provide detailed procedures for the generation of site-specific mutations in the rat genome through injection of Cas9/sgRNA into one-cell embryos.

25398345	The rapid advancement of genome-editing techniques holds much promise for the field of human gene therapy. From bacteria to model organisms and human cells, genome editing tools such as zinc-finger nucleases (ZNFs), TALENs, and CRISPR/Cas9 have been successfully used to manipulate the respective genomes with unprecedented precision. With regard to human gene therapy, it is of great interest to test the feasibility of genome editing in primary human hematopoietic cells that could potentially be used to treat a variety of human genetic disorders such as hemoglobinopathies, primary immunodeficiencies, and cancer. In this chapter, we explore the use of the CRISPR/Cas9 system for the efficient ablation of genes in two clinically relevant primary human cell types, CD4+ T cells and CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. By using two guide RNAs directed at a single locus, we achieve highly efficient and predictable deletions that ablate gene function. The use of a Cas9-2A-GFP fusion protein allows FACS-based enrichment of the transfected cells. The ease of designing, constructing, and testing guide RNAs makes this dual guide strategy an attractive approach for the efficient deletion of clinically relevant genes in primary human hematopoietic stem and effector cells and enables the use of CRISPR/Cas9 for gene therapy.

25398343	Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) have the potential to generate all adult cell types, including rare or inaccessible human cell populations, thus providing a unique platform for disease studies. To realize this promise, it is essential to develop methods for efficient genetic manipulations in hPSCs. Established using TALEN (transcription activator-like effector nuclease) and CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas (CRISPR-associated) systems, the iCRISPR platform supports a variety of genome-engineering approaches with high efficiencies. Here, we first describe the establishment of the iCRISPR platform through TALEN-mediated targeting of inducible Cas9 expression cassettes into the AAVS1 locus. Next, we provide a series of technical procedures for using iCRISPR to achieve one-step knockout of one or multiple gene(s), "scarless" introduction of precise nucleotide alterations, as well as inducible knockout during hPSC differentiation. We present an optimized workflow, as well as guidelines for the selection of CRISPR targeting sequences and the design of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) homology-directed DNA repair templates for the introduction of specific nucleotide alterations. We have successfully used these protocols in four different hPSC lines, including human embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells. Once the iCRISPR platform is established, clonal lines with desired genetic modifications can be established in as little as 1 month. The methods described here enable a wide range of genome-engineering applications in hPSCs, thus providing a valuable resource for the creation of diverse hPSC-based disease models with superior speed and ease.

25398342	The use of CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein) for targeted genome editing has been widely adopted and is considered a "game changing" technology. The ease and rapidity by which this approach can be used to modify endogenous loci in a wide spectrum of cell types and organisms makes it a powerful tool for customizable genetic modifications as well as for large-scale functional genomics. The development of retrovirus-based expression platforms to simultaneously deliver the Cas9 nuclease and single guide (sg) RNAs provides unique opportunities by which to ensure stable and reproducible expression of the editing tools and a broad cell targeting spectrum, while remaining compatible with in vivo genetic screens. Here, we describe methods and highlight considerations for designing and generating sgRNA libraries in all-in-one retroviral vectors for such applications.

25398341	Thousands of DNA breaks occur daily in mammalian cells, including potentially tumorigenic double-strand breaks (DSBs) and less dangerous but vastly more abundant single-strand breaks (SSBs). The majority of SSBs are quickly repaired, but some can be converted to DSBs, posing a threat to the integrity of the genome. Although SSBs are usually repaired by dedicated pathways, they can also trigger homologous recombination (HR), an error-free pathway generally associated with DSB repair. While HR-mediated DSB repair has been extensively studied, the mechanisms of HR-mediated SSB repair are less clear. This chapter describes a protocol to investigate SSB-induced HR in mammalian cells employing the DR-GFP reporter, which has been widely used in DSB repair studies, together with an adapted bacterial CRISPR/Cas system.

25398340	The RNA-guided, sequence-specific endonuclease Cas9 has been widely adopted as genome engineering tool due to its efficiency and ease of use. Derived from the microbial CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat) type II adaptive immune system, Cas9 has now been successfully engineered for genome editing applications in a variety of animal and plant species. To reduce potential off-target mutagenesis by wild-type Cas9, homology- and structure-guided mutagenesis of Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 catalytic domains has produced "nicking" enzymes (Cas9n) capable of inducing single-strand nicks rather than double-strand breaks. Since nicks are generally repaired with high fidelity in eukaryotic cells, Cas9n can be leveraged to mediate highly specific genome editing, either via nonhomologous end-joining or homology-directed repair. Here we describe the preparation, testing, and application of Cas9n reagents for precision mammalian genome engineering.	AE Trevino|F Zhang
25398334	CRISPR RNA-guided nucleases have recently emerged as a robust genome-editing platform that functions in a wide range of organisms. To reduce off-target effects of these nucleases, we developed and validated a modified system that uses truncated guide RNAs (tru-gRNAs). The use of tru-gRNAs leads to decreases in off-target effects and does not generally compromise the on-target efficiencies of these genome-editing nucleases. In this chapter, we describe guidelines for identifying potential tru-gRNA target sites and protocols for measuring the on-target efficiencies of CRISPR RNA-guided nucleases in human cells.

25398078	The CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) platform has been developed as a general method to direct proteins of interest to gene targets. While the native CRISPR system delivers a nuclease that cleaves and potentially mutates target genes, researchers have recently employed catalytically inactive CRISPR-associated 9 nuclease (dCas9) in order to target and repress genes without DNA cleavage or mutagenesis. With the intent of improving repression efficiency in mammalian cells, researchers have also fused dCas9 with a KRAB repressor domain. Here, we evaluated different genomic sgRNA targeting sites for repression of TP53. The sites spanned a 200-kb distance, which included the promoter, transcript sequence, and regions flanking the endogenous human TP53 gene. We showed that repression up to 86% can be achieved with dCas9 alone (i.e., without use of the KRAB domain) by targeting the complex to sites near the TP53 transcriptional start site. This work demonstrates that efficient transcriptional repression of endogenous human genes can be achieved by the targeted delivery of dCas9. Yet, the efficiency of repression strongly depends on the choice of the sgRNA target site.	IE Lawhorn|JP Ferreira|CL Wang
25396299	Vertebrate reproduction is controlled by two gonadotropins (FSH and LH) from the pituitary. Despite numerous studies on FSH and LH in fish species, their functions in reproduction still remain poorly defined. This is partly due to the lack of powerful genetic approaches for functional studies in adult fish. This situation is now changing with the emergence of genome-editing technologies, especially Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nuclease (TALEN) and Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR). In this study, we deleted the hormone-specific β-genes of both FSH and LH in the zebrafish using TALEN. This was followed by a phenotype analysis for key reproductive events, including gonadal differentiation, puberty onset, gametogenesis, final maturation, and fertility. FSH-deficient zebrafish (fshb(-/-)) were surprisingly fertile in both sexes; however, the development of both the ovary and testis was significantly delayed. In contrast, LH-deficient zebrafish (lhb(-/-)) showed normal gonadal growth, but the females failed to spawn and were therefore infertile. Using previtellogenic follicles as the marker, we observed a significant delay of puberty onset in the fshb mutant but not the lhb mutant females. Interestingly, FSH seemed to play a role in maintaining the female status because we repeatedly observed sexual reversal in the fshb mutant. Neither the fshb nor lhb mutation alone seemed to affect gonadal differentiation; however, the double mutation of the two genes led to all males, although the development of the testis was significantly delayed. In summary, our data confirmed some well-known functions of FSH and LH in fish while also providing evidence for novel functions, which would be difficult to reveal using traditional biochemical and physiological approaches.

25393779	Here we present a protocol for the conversion of eGFP-transgenic zebrafish lines into lines expressing Gal4 from the same locus. This conversion allows the in-depth analysis of the former eGFP-expressing cell population; with the Gal4-upstream activating sequence (UAS) system, diverse UAS transgenes can be transactivated. Site-specific targeting of the gene encoding eGFP is achieved using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) system. A single-guide RNA (sgRNA) that targets eGFP is injected into embryos together with a donor vector containing an optimized version of Gal4 (KalTA4) to trigger integration of the donor into the targeted eGFP genomic location. To enable screening for successful integration events, injection is performed in a UAS:RFP transgenic background; fish showing mosaic eGFP-to-RFP conversion are raised to adulthood. The progeny of these adult fish are then screened for stable germline transmission, and converted progeny are used to generate stable lines. We have been able to generate two stably converted transgenic lines within 4 months.	TO Auer|K Duroure|JP Concordet|F Del Bene
25392068	The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-associated endonuclease 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) system has been demonstrated to be a robust genome engineering tool in a variety of organisms including plants. However, it has been shown that the CRISPR/Cas9 system cleaves genomic DNA sequences containing mismatches to the guide RNA strand. We expected that this low specificity could be exploited to induce multihomeologous and multiparalogous gene knockouts. In the case of polyploid plants, simultaneous modification of multiple homeologous genes, i.e. genes with similar but not identical DNA sequences, is often needed to obtain a desired phenotype. Even in diploid plants, disruption of multiparalogous genes, which have functional redundancy, is often needed. To validate the applicability of the CRISPR/Cas9 system to target mutagenesis of paralogous genes in rice, we designed a single-guide RNA (sgRNA) that recognized 20 bp sequences of cyclin-dependent kinase B2 (CDKB2) as an on-target locus. These 20 bp possess similarity to other rice CDK genes (CDKA1, CDKA2 and CDKB1) with different numbers of mismatches. We analyzed mutations in these four CDK genes in plants regenerated from Cas9/sgRNA-transformed calli and revealed that single, double and triple mutants of CDKA2, CDKB1 and CDKB2 can be created by a single sgRNA.

25378576	A retrospective investigation was performed to evaluate whole-genome sequencing as a benchmark for comparing molecular subtyping methods for Salmonella enterica serotype Enteritidis and survey the population structure of commonly encountered S. enterica serotype Enteritidis outbreak isolates in the United States. A total of 52 S. enterica serotype Enteritidis isolates representing 16 major outbreaks and three sporadic cases collected between 2001 and 2012 were sequenced and subjected to subtyping by four different methods: (i) whole-genome single-nucleotide-polymorphism typing (WGST), (ii) multiple-locus variable-number tandem-repeat (VNTR) analysis (MLVA), (iii) clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats combined with multi-virulence-locus sequence typing (CRISPR-MVLST), and (iv) pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). WGST resolved all outbreak clusters and provided useful robust phylogenetic inference results with high epidemiological correlation. While both MLVA and CRISPR-MVLST yielded higher discriminatory power than PFGE, MLVA outperformed the other methods in delineating outbreak clusters whereas CRISPR-MVLST showed the potential to trace major lineages and ecological origins of S. enterica serotype Enteritidis. Our results suggested that whole-genome sequencing makes a viable platform for the evaluation and benchmarking of molecular subtyping methods.

25378133	The CRISPR-Cas9 system consists of a site-specific, targetable DNA nuclease that holds great potential in gene editing and genome-wide screening applications. To apply the CRISPR-Cas9 system to these assays successfully, the rate at which Cas9 induces DNA breaks at undesired loci must be understood. We characterized the rate of Cas9 off-target activity in typical Cas9 experiments in two human and one mouse cell lines. We analyzed the Cas9 cutting activity of 12 gRNAs in both their targeted sites and ∼90 predicted off-target sites per gRNA. In a Cas9-based knockout experiment, gRNAs induced detectable Cas9 cutting activity in all on-target sites and in only a few off-target sites genome-wide in human 293FT, human-induced pluripotent stem (hiPS) cells, and mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. Both the cutting rates and DNA repair patterns were highly correlated between the two human cell lines in both on-target and off-target sites. In clonal Cas9 cutting analysis in mouse ES cells, biallelic Cas9 cutting was observed with low off-target activity. Our results show that off-target activity of Cas9 is low and predictable by the degree of sequence identity between the gRNA and a potential off-target site. Off-target Cas9 activity can be minimized by selecting gRNAs with few off-target sites of near complementarity.	EP Tan|Y Li|Mdel C Velasco-Herrera|K Yusa|A Bradley
25373540	The RNA-guided Cas9 endonuclease specifically targets and cleaves DNA in a sequence-dependent manner and has been widely used for programmable genome editing. Cas9 activity is dependent on interactions with guide RNAs, and evolutionarily divergent Cas9 nucleases have been shown to work orthogonally. However, the molecular basis of selective Cas9:guide-RNA interactions is poorly understood. Here, we identify and characterize six conserved modules within native crRNA:tracrRNA duplexes and single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) that direct Cas9 endonuclease activity. We show the bulge and nexus are necessary for DNA cleavage and demonstrate that the nexus and hairpins are instrumental in defining orthogonality between systems. In contrast, the crRNA:tracrRNA complementary region can be modified or partially removed. Collectively, our results establish guide RNA features that drive DNA targeting by Cas9 and open new design and engineering avenues for CRISPR technologies.

25368186	Mobile genetic elements in bacteria are neutralized by a system based on clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins. Type I CRISPR-Cas systems use a "Cascade" ribonucleoprotein complex to guide RNA specifically to complementary sequence in invader double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), a process called "interference." After target recognition by Cascade, formation of an R-loop triggers recruitment of a Cas3 nuclease-helicase, completing the interference process by destroying the invader dsDNA. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of CRISPR interference, we analyzed crystal structures of Cas3 from the bacterium Thermobaculum terrenum, with and without a bound ATP analog. The structures reveal a histidine-aspartate (HD)-type nuclease domain fused to superfamily-2 (SF2) helicase domains and a distinct C-terminal domain. Binding of ATP analog at the interface of the SF2 helicase RecA-like domains rearranges a motif V with implications for the enzyme mechanism. The HD-nucleolytic site contains two metal ions that are positioned at the end of a proposed nucleic acid-binding tunnel running through the SF2 helicase structure. This structural alignment suggests a mechanism for 3' to 5' nucleolytic processing of the displaced strand of invader DNA that is coordinated with ATP-dependent 3' to 5' translocation of Cas3 along DNA. In agreement with biochemical studies, the presented Cas3 structures reveal important mechanistic details on the neutralization of genetic invaders by type I CRISPR-Cas systems.

25367038	The effector complex of the Cmr/type III-B CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat)-Cas (CRISPR-associated) system cleaves RNAs recognized by the CRISPR RNA (crRNA) of the complex and includes six protein subunits of unknown functions. Using reconstituted Pyrococcus furiosus Cmr complexes, we found that each of the six Cmr proteins plays a critical role in either crRNA interaction or target RNA capture. Cmr2, Cmr3, Cmr4, and Cmr5 are all required for formation of a crRNA-containing complex detected by native gel electrophoresis, and the conserved 5' repeat sequence tag and 5'-OH group of the crRNA are essential for the interaction. Interestingly, capture of the complementary target RNA additionally requires both Cmr1 and Cmr6. In detailed functional studies, we determined that P. furiosus Cmr complexes cleave target RNAs at 6-nucleotide (nt) intervals in the region of complementarity, beginning 5 nt downstream from the crRNA tag and continuing to within ∼14 nt of the 3' end of the crRNA. Our findings indicate that Cmr3 recognizes the signature crRNA tag sequence (and depends on protein-protein interactions with Cmr2, Cmr4, and Cmr5), each Cmr4 subunit mediates a target RNA cleavage, and Cmr1 and Cmr6 mediate an essential interaction between the 3' region of the crRNA and the target RNA.

25362885	The CRISPR/Cas9 system has emerged as an intriguing new technology for genome engineering. It utilizes the bacterial endonuclease Cas9 which, when delivered to eukaryotic cells in conjunction with a user-specified small guide RNA (gRNA), cleaves the chromosomal DNA at the target site. Here we show that concurrent delivery of gRNAs designed to target two different sites in a human chromosome introduce DNA double-strand breaks in the chromosome and give rise to targeted deletions of the intervening genomic segment. Predetermined genomic DNA segments ranging from several-hundred base pairs to 1 Mbp can be precisely deleted at frequencies of 1-10%, with no apparent correlation between the size of the deleted fragment and the deletion frequency. The high efficiency of this technique holds promise for large genomic deletions that could be useful in generation of cell and animal models with engineered chromosomes.

25352017	Application of the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing system in the model organism Schizosaccharomyces pombe has been hampered by the lack of constructs to express RNA of arbitrary sequence. Here we present expression constructs that use the promoter/leader RNA of K RNA (rrk1) and a ribozyme to produce the targeting guide RNA. Together with constitutive expression of Cas9, this system achieves selection-free specific mutagenesis with efficiencies approaching 100%. The rrk1 CRISPR-Cas9 method enables rapid and efficient genome manipulation and unlocks the CRISPR toolset for use in fission yeast.	JZ Jacobs|KM Ciccaglione|V Tournier|M Zaratiegui
25348612	Osteosarcoma is the most common type primary malignant tumor of bone. Patients with regional osteosarcoma are routinely treated with surgery and chemotherapy. In addition, many patients with metastatic or recurrent osteosarcoma show poor prognosis with current chemotherapy agents. Therefore, it is important to improve the general condition and the overall survival rate of patients with osteosarcoma by identifying novel therapeutic strategies. Recent studies have revealed that CDK11 is essential in osteosarcoma cell growth and survival by inhibiting CDK11 mRNA expression with RNAi. Here, we apply the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 system, a robust and highly efficient novel genome editing tool, to determine the effect of targeting endogenous CDK11 gene at the DNA level in osteosarcoma cell lines. We show that CDK11 can be efficiently silenced by CRISPR-Cas9. Inhibition of CDK11 is associated with decreased cell proliferation and viability, and induces cell death in osteosarcoma cell lines KHOS and U-2OS. Furthermore, the migration and invasion activities are also markedly reduced by CDK11 knockout. These results demonstrate that CRISPR-Cas9 system is a useful tool for the modification of endogenous CDK11 gene expression, and CRISPR-Cas9 targeted CDK11 knockout may be a promising therapeutic regimen for the treatment of osteosarcoma.

25344729	Alteromonas macleodii is a ubiquitous gammaproteobacterium shown to play a biogeochemical role in marine environments. Two A. macleodii strains (AltDE and AltDE1) isolated from the same sample (i.e., the same place at the same time) show considerable genomic differences. In this study, we investigate the transcriptional response of these two strains to varying growth conditions in order to investigate differences in their ability to adapt to varying environmental parameters.	RNA sequencing revealed transcriptional changes between all growth conditions examined (e.g., temperature and medium) as well as differences between the two A. macleodii strains within a given condition. The main inter-strain differences were more marked in the adaptation to grow on minimal medium with glucose and, even more so, under starvation. These differences suggested that AltDE1 may have an advantage over AltDE when glucose is the major carbon source, and co-culture experiments confirmed this advantage. Additional differences were observed between the two strains in the expression of ncRNAs and phage-related genes, as well as motility.	This study shows that the genomic diversity observed in closely related strains of A. macleodii from a single environment result in different transcriptional responses to changing environmental parameters. This data provides additional support for the idea that greater diversity at the strain level of a microbial community could enhance the community's ability to adapt to environmental shifts.

25344637	Genome editing is one of the most powerful tools for revealing gene function and improving crop plants. Recently, RNA-guided genome editing using the type II clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated protein (Cas) system has been used as a powerful and efficient tool for genome editing in various organisms. Here, we report genome editing in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) mediated by the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Two genes, NtPDS and NtPDR6, were used for targeted mutagenesis. First, we examined the transient genome editing activity of this system in tobacco protoplasts, insertion and deletion (indel) mutations were observed with frequencies of 16.2-20.3% after transfecting guide RNA (gRNA) and the nuclease Cas9 in tobacco protoplasts. The two genes were also mutated using multiplexing gRNA at a time. Additionally, targeted deletions and inversions of a 1.8-kb fragment between two target sites in the NtPDS locus were demonstrated, while indel mutations were also detected at both the sites. Second, we obtained transgenic tobacco plants with NtPDS and NtPDR6 mutations induced by Cas9/gRNA. The mutation percentage was 81.8% for NtPDS gRNA4 and 87.5% for NtPDR6 gRNA2. Obvious phenotypes were observed, etiolated leaves for the psd mutant and more branches for the pdr6 mutant, indicating that highly efficient biallelic mutations occurred in both transgenic lines. No significant off-target mutations were obtained. Our results show that the CRISPR/Cas9 system is a useful tool for targeted mutagenesis of the tobacco genome.

25337879	Cancer is a multistep process that involves mutations and other alterations in oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes. Genome sequencing studies have identified a large collection of genetic alterations that occur in human cancers. However, the determination of which mutations are causally related to tumorigenesis remains a major challenge. Here we describe a novel CRISPR/Cas9-based approach for rapid functional investigation of candidate genes in well-established autochthonous mouse models of cancer. Using a Kras(G12D)-driven lung cancer model, we performed functional characterization of a panel of tumour suppressor genes with known loss-of-function alterations in human lung cancer. Cre-dependent somatic activation of oncogenic Kras(G12D) combined with CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing of tumour suppressor genes resulted in lung adenocarcinomas with distinct histopathological and molecular features. This rapid somatic genome engineering approach enables functional characterization of putative cancer genes in the lung and other tissues using autochthonous mouse models. We anticipate that this approach can be used to systematically dissect the complex catalogue of mutations identified in cancer genome sequencing studies.

25337876	Chromosomal rearrangements have a central role in the pathogenesis of human cancers and often result in the expression of therapeutically actionable gene fusions. A recently discovered example is a fusion between the genes echinoderm microtubule-associated protein like 4 (EML4) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), generated by an inversion on the short arm of chromosome 2: inv(2)(p21p23). The EML4-ALK oncogene is detected in a subset of human non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) and is clinically relevant because it confers sensitivity to ALK inhibitors. Despite their importance, modelling such genetic events in mice has proven challenging and requires complex manipulation of the germ line. Here we describe an efficient method to induce specific chromosomal rearrangements in vivo using viral-mediated delivery of the CRISPR/Cas9 system to somatic cells of adult animals. We apply it to generate a mouse model of Eml4-Alk-driven lung cancer. The resulting tumours invariably harbour the Eml4-Alk inversion, express the Eml4-Alk fusion gene, display histopathological and molecular features typical of ALK(+) human NSCLCs, and respond to treatment with ALK inhibitors. The general strategy described here substantially expands our ability to model human cancers in mice and potentially in other organisms.

25336740	The CRISPR/Cas9 system has ushered in a new era of targeted genetic manipulations. Here, we report the use of CRISPR/Cas9 to induce double-stranded breaks in the genome of the sea squirt Ciona intestinalis. We use electroporation to deliver CRISPR/Cas9 components for tissue-specific disruption of the Ebf (Collier/Olf/EBF) gene in hundreds of synchronized Ciona embryos. Phenotyping of transfected embryos in the 'F0' generation revealed that endogenous Ebf function is required for specification of Islet-expressing motor ganglion neurons and atrial siphon muscles. We demonstrate that CRISPR/Cas9 is sufficiently effective and specific to generate large numbers of embryos carrying mutations in a targeted gene of interest, which should allow for rapid screening of gene function in Ciona.

25336735	Recent advances in the targeted modification of complex eukaryotic genomes have unlocked a new era of genome engineering. From the pioneering work using zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs), to the advent of the versatile and specific TALEN systems, and most recently the highly accessible CRISPR/Cas9 systems, we now possess an unprecedented ability to analyze developmental processes using sophisticated designer genetic tools. In this Review, we summarize the common approaches and applications of these still-evolving tools as they are being used in the most popular model developmental systems. Excitingly, these robust and simple genomic engineering tools also promise to revolutionize developmental studies using less well established experimental organisms.

25327456	The CRISPR/Cas nuclease is becoming a major tool for targeted mutagenesis in eukaryotes by inducing double-strand breaks (DSBs) at pre-selected genomic sites that are repaired by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) in an error-prone way. In plants, it could be demonstrated that the Cas9 nuclease is able to induce heritable mutations in Arabidopsis thaliana and rice. Gene targeting (GT) by homologous recombination (HR) can also be induced by DSBs. Using a natural nuclease and marker genes, we previously developed an in planta GT strategy in which both a targeting vector and targeting locus are activated simultaneously via DSB induction during plant development. Here, we demonstrate that this strategy can be used for natural genes by CRISPR/Cas-mediated DSB induction. We were able to integrate a resistance cassette into the ADH1 locus of A. thaliana via HR. Heritable events were identified using a PCR-based genotyping approach, characterised by Southern blotting and confirmed on the sequence level. A major concern is the specificity of the CRISPR/Cas nucleases. Off-target effects might be avoided using two adjacent sgRNA target sequences to guide the Cas9 nickase to each of the two DNA strands, resulting in the formation of a DSB. By amplicon deep sequencing, we demonstrate that this Cas9 paired nickase strategy has a mutagenic potential comparable with that of the nuclease, while the resulting mutations are mostly deletions. We also demonstrate the stable inheritance of such mutations in A. thaliana.	S Schiml|F Fauser|H Puchta
25326897	Probing gene function in the mammalian brain can be greatly assisted with methods to manipulate the genome of neurons in vivo. The clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated endonuclease (Cas)9 from Streptococcus pyogenes (SpCas9) can be used to edit single or multiple genes in replicating eukaryotic cells, resulting in frame-shifting insertion/deletion (indel) mutations and subsequent protein depletion. Here, we delivered SpCas9 and guide RNAs using adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors to target single (Mecp2) as well as multiple genes (Dnmt1, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b) in the adult mouse brain in vivo. We characterized the effects of genome modifications in postmitotic neurons using biochemical, genetic, electrophysiological and behavioral readouts. Our results demonstrate that AAV-mediated SpCas9 genome editing can enable reverse genetic studies of gene function in the brain.

25324299	The development of clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) technologies promises a quantum leap in genome engineering of model organisms. However, CRISPR-mediated gene targeting reports in Drosophila melanogaster are still restricted to a few genes, use variable experimental conditions, and vary in efficiency, questioning the universal applicability of the method. Here, we developed an efficient two-step strategy to flexibly engineer the fly genome by combining CRISPR with recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE). In the first step, two sgRNAs, whose activity had been tested in cell culture, were co-injected together with a donor plasmid into transgenic Act5C-Cas9, Ligase4 mutant embryos and the homologous integration events were identified by eye fluorescence. In the second step, the eye marker was replaced with DNA sequences of choice using RMCE enabling flexible gene modification. We applied this strategy to engineer four different locations in the genome, including a gene on the fourth chromosome, at comparably high efficiencies. Our data suggest that any fly laboratory can engineer their favorite gene for a broad range of applications within approximately 3 months.	X Zhang|WH Koolhaas|F Schnorrer
25319067	The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated system enables biologists to edit genomes precisely and provides a powerful tool for perturbing endogenous gene regulation, modulation of epigenetic markers, and genome architecture. However, there are concerns about the specificity of the system, especially the usages of knocking out a gene. Previous designing tools either were mostly built-in websites or ran as command-line programs, and none of them ran locally and acquired a user-friendly interface. In addition, with the development of CRISPR-derived systems, such as chromosome imaging, there were still no tools helping users to generate specific end-user spacers. We herein present CRISPR Primer Designer for researchers to design primers for CRISPR applications. The program has a user-friendly interface, can analyze the BLAST results by using multiple parameters, score for each candidate spacer, and generate the primers when using a certain plasmid. In addition, CRISPR Primer Designer runs locally and can be used to search spacer clusters, and exports primers for the CRISPR-Cas system-based chromosome imaging system.	M Yan|SR Zhou|HW Xue
25315507	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated protein (Cas)9-mediated genome modification enables us to edit the genomes of a variety of organisms rapidly and efficiently. The advantages of the CRISPR-Cas9 system have made it an increasingly popular genetic engineering tool for biological and therapeutic applications. Moreover, CRISPR-Cas9 has been employed to recruit functional domains that repress/activate gene expression or label specific genomic loci in living cells or organisms, in order to explore developmental mechanisms, gene expression regulation, and animal behavior. One major concern about this system is its specificity; although CRISPR-Cas9-mediated off-target mutation has been broadly studied, more efforts are required to further improve the specificity of CRISPR-Cas9. We will also discuss the potential applications of CRISPR-Cas9.	Y Ma|L Zhang|X Huang
25313016	Bacterial genomics has greatly expanded our understanding of microdiversification patterns within a species, but analyses at higher taxonomical levels are necessary to understand and predict the independent rise of pathogens in a genus. We have sampled, sequenced, and assessed the diversity of genomes of validly named and tentative species of the Acinetobacter genus, a clade including major nosocomial pathogens and biotechnologically important species. We inferred a robust global phylogeny and delimited several new putative species. The genus is very ancient and extremely diverse: Genomes of highly divergent species share more orthologs than certain strains within a species. We systematically characterized elements and mechanisms driving genome diversification, such as conjugative elements, insertion sequences, and natural transformation. We found many error-prone polymerases that may play a role in resistance to toxins, antibiotics, and in the generation of genetic variation. Surprisingly, temperate phages, poorly studied in Acinetobacter, were found to account for a significant fraction of most genomes. Accordingly, many genomes encode clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas systems with some of the largest CRISPR-arrays found so far in bacteria. Integrons are strongly overrepresented in Acinetobacter baumannii, which correlates with its frequent resistance to antibiotics. Our data suggest that A. baumannii arose from an ancient population bottleneck followed by population expansion under strong purifying selection. The outstanding diversification of the species occurred largely by horizontal transfer, including some allelic recombination, at specific hotspots preferentially located close to the replication terminus. Our work sets a quantitative basis to understand the diversification of Acinetobacter into emerging resistant and versatile pathogens.

25307957	The use of third-generation lentiviral vectors is now commonplace in most areas of basic biology. These systems provide a fast, efficient means for modulating gene expression, but experimental design needs to be carefully considered to minimize potential artefacts arising from off-target effects and other confounding factors. This review offers a starting point for those new to lentiviral-based vector systems, addressing the main issues involved with the use of lentiviral systems in vitro and outlines considerations which should be taken into account during experimental design. Factors such as selecting an appropriate system and controls, and practical titration of viral transduction are important considerations for experimental design. We also briefly describe some of the more recent advances in genome editing technology. TALENs and CRISPRs offer an alternative to lentivirus, providing endogenous gene editing with reduced off-target effects often at the expense of efficiency.	RF Shearer|DN Saunders
25303670	The Cas9/CRISPR system has become a popular choice for genome editing. In this system, binding of a single guide (sg) RNA to a cognate genomic sequence enables the Cas9 nuclease to induce a double-strand break at that locus. This break is next repaired by an error-prone mechanism, leading to mutation and gene disruption. In this study we describe a range of refinements of the method, including stable cell lines expressing Cas9, and a PCR based protocol for the generation of the sgRNA. We also describe a simple methodology that allows both elimination of Cas9 from cells after gene disruption and re-introduction of the disrupted gene. This advance enables easy assessment of the off target effects associated with gene disruption, as well as phenotype-based structure-function analysis. In our study, we used the Fan1 DNA repair gene as control in these experiments. Cas9/CRISPR-mediated Fan1 disruption occurred at frequencies of around 29%, and resulted in the anticipated spectrum of genotoxin hypersensitivity, which was rescued by re-introduction of Fan1.

25275497	The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-associated enzyme Cas9 is an RNA-guided nuclease that has been widely adapted for genome editing in eukaryotic cells. However, the in vivo target specificity of Cas9 is poorly understood and most studies rely on in silico predictions to define the potential off-target editing spectrum. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq), we delineate the genome-wide binding panorama of catalytically inactive Cas9 directed by two different single guide (sg) RNAs targeting the Trp53 locus. Cas9:sgRNA complexes are able to load onto multiple sites with short seed regions adjacent to (5')NGG(3') protospacer adjacent motifs (PAM). Yet among 43 ChIP-seq sites harboring seed regions analyzed for mutational status, we find editing only at the intended on-target locus and one off-target site. In vitro analysis of target site recognition revealed that interactions between the 5' end of the guide and PAM-distal target sequences are necessary to efficiently engage Cas9 nucleolytic activity, providing an explanation for why off-target editing is significantly lower than expected from ChIP-seq data.

25274302	The CRISPR-associated protein Cas9 is an RNA-guided DNA endonuclease that uses RNA-DNA complementarity to identify target sites for sequence-specific double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) cleavage. In its native context, Cas9 acts on DNA substrates exclusively because both binding and catalysis require recognition of a short DNA sequence, known as the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), next to and on the strand opposite the twenty-nucleotide target site in dsDNA. Cas9 has proven to be a versatile tool for genome engineering and gene regulation in a large range of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell types, and in whole organisms, but it has been thought to be incapable of targeting RNA. Here we show that Cas9 binds with high affinity to single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) targets matching the Cas9-associated guide RNA sequence when the PAM is presented in trans as a separate DNA oligonucleotide. Furthermore, PAM-presenting oligonucleotides (PAMmers) stimulate site-specific endonucleolytic cleavage of ssRNA targets, similar to PAM-mediated stimulation of Cas9-catalysed DNA cleavage. Using specially designed PAMmers, Cas9 can be specifically directed to bind or cut RNA targets while avoiding corresponding DNA sequences, and we demonstrate that this strategy enables the isolation of a specific endogenous messenger RNA from cells. These results reveal a fundamental connection between PAM binding and substrate selection by Cas9, and highlight the utility of Cas9 for programmable transcript recognition without the need for tags.

25271839	The availability of techniques to create desired genetic mutations has enabled the laboratory mouse as an extensively used model organism in biomedical research including human genetics. A new addition to this existing technical repertoire is the CRISPR/Cas system. Specifically, this system allows editing of the mouse genome much more quickly than the previously used techniques, and, more importantly, multiple mutations can be created in a single experiment. Here we provide protocols for preparation of CRISPR/Cas reagents and microinjection into one-cell mouse embryos to create knockout or knock-in mouse models.

25269785	Engineered endonucleases, such as zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) system, provide a powerful approach for genome editing in animals. However, the microinjection of endonucleases into embryos requires a high skill level, is time consuming, and may cause damage to embryos. Here, we demonstrate that the electroporation of endonuclease mRNAs into intact embryos can induce editing at targeted loci and efficiently produce knockout rats. It is noteworthy that the electroporation of ZFNs resulted in an embryonic survival rate (91%) and a genome-editing rate (73%) that were more than 2-fold higher than the corresponding rates from conventional microinjection. Electroporation technology provides a simple and effective method to produce knockout animals.	T Kaneko|T Sakuma|T Yamamoto|T Mashimo
25265542	The potential use of CRISPR loci genotyping to elucidate population dynamics and microevolution of 146 Yersinia pestis strains from different biovars and locations was investigated in this work. The majority of strains from the Orientalis biovar presented specific spacer arrays, allowing for the establishment of a CRISPR signature for their respective isolates. Twenty-one new spacers were found in the Y. pestis strains from plague foci in Brazil. Ninety-three (64%) strains were grouped in the G1 genotype, whereas the others were distributed in 35 genotypes. This study allowed observing a microevolutionary process in a group of Y. pestis isolated from Brazil. We also identified specific genotypes of Y. pestis that were important for the establishment of the bacteria in plague foci in Brazil. The data have provided supporting evidence for the diversity and dynamics of CRISPR loci present in the genome of Y. pestis strains from plague foci in Brazil.

25264186	Bistable switches are fundamental regulatory elements of complex systems, ranging from electronics to living cells. Designed genetic toggle switches have been constructed from pairs of natural transcriptional repressors wired to inhibit one another. The complexity of the engineered regulatory circuits can be increased using orthogonal transcriptional regulators based on designed DNA-binding domains. However, a mutual repressor-based toggle switch comprising DNA-binding domains of transcription-activator-like effectors (TALEs) did not support bistability in mammalian cells. Here, the challenge of engineering a bistable switch based on monomeric DNA-binding domains is solved via the introduction of a positive feedback loop composed of activators based on the same TALE domains as their opposing repressors and competition for the same DNA operator site. This design introduces nonlinearity and results in epigenetic bistability. This principle could be used to employ other monomeric DNA-binding domains such as CRISPR for applications ranging from reprogramming cells to building digital biological memory.

25263330	CRISPR-Cas9 is a versatile genome editing technology for studying the functions of genetic elements. To broadly enable the application of Cas9 in vivo, we established a Cre-dependent Cas9 knockin mouse. We demonstrated in vivo as well as ex vivo genome editing using adeno-associated virus (AAV)-, lentivirus-, or particle-mediated delivery of guide RNA in neurons, immune cells, and endothelial cells. Using these mice, we simultaneously modeled the dynamics of KRAS, p53, and LKB1, the top three significantly mutated genes in lung adenocarcinoma. Delivery of a single AAV vector in the lung generated loss-of-function mutations in p53 and Lkb1, as well as homology-directed repair-mediated Kras(G12D) mutations, leading to macroscopic tumors of adenocarcinoma pathology. Together, these results suggest that Cas9 mice empower a wide range of biological and disease modeling applications.

25260929	The Swarm rat chondrosarcoma (RCS) cell lines derived from a spontaneous neoplasm in a rat spine several decades ago have provided excellent models of chondrosarcoma tumor development. In addition the robust chondrocyte phenotype (expression of a large panel of genes identical to that seen in normal rat cartilage) and the ability to generate cell clones have facilitated their extensive use in the identification of chondrocyte proteins and genes. The clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) technology employing the RNA-guided nuclease Cas9 has rapidly dominated the genome engineering field as a unique and powerful gene editing tool. We have generated a stable RCS cell line (RCS Cas9) expressing the nuclease Cas9 that enables the editing of any target gene or non-coding RNA by simple transfection with a guide RNA. As proof of principle, stable cell lines with targeted ablation of aggrecan expression (Acan KO) were generated and characterized. The studies show that stable chondrocyte cell lines with targeted genome editing can be quickly generated from RCS Cas9 cells using this system. The Acan KO cell lines also provided a tool for characterizing the response of chondrocytes to aggrecan loss and the role of aggrecan in chondrosarcoma development. Loss of aggrecan expression while not affecting the chondrocyte phenotype resulted in a much firmer attachment of cells to their substrate in culture. Large changes in the expression of several genes were observed in response to the absence of the proteoglycan matrix, including those for several small leucine rich proteoglycans (SLRPs), transcription factors and membrane transporters. Acan KO cells failed to form a substantial chondrosarcoma when injected subcutaneously in nude mice consistent with previous suggestions that the glycosaminoglycan-rich matrix surrounding the chondrosarcoma protects it from destruction by the host immune system. The studies provide new understanding of aggrecan function and the RCS Cas9 cell line is expected to provide a very valuable tool for the study gene function in chondrocytes.

25255092	Conventional embryonic stem cell (ESC)-based gene targeting, zinc-finger nuclease (ZFN) and transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) technologies are powerful strategies for the generation of genetically modified animals. Recently, the CRISPR/Cas system has emerged as an efficient and convenient alternative to these approaches. We have used the CRISPR/Cas system to generate rat strains that carry mutations in multiple genes through direct injection of RNAs into one-cell embryos, demonstrating the high efficiency of Cas9-mediated gene editing in rats for simultaneous generation of compound gene mutant models. Here we describe a stepwise procedure for the generation of knockout and knock-in rats. This protocol provides guidelines for the selection of genomic targets, synthesis of guide RNAs, design and construction of homologous recombination (HR) template vectors, embryo microinjection, and detection of mutations and insertions in founders or their progeny. The procedure from target design to identification of founders can take as little as 6 weeks, of which <10 d is actual hands-on working time.

25251852	Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria meningitidis are closely related organisms that cause the sexually transmitted infection gonorrhea and serious bacterial meningitis and septicemia, respectively. Both species possess multiple mechanisms to alter the expression of surface-exposed proteins through the processes of phase and antigenic variation. This potential for wide variability in surface-exposed structures allows the organisms to always have subpopulations of divergent antigenic types to avoid immune surveillance and to contribute to functional variation. Additionally, the Neisseria are naturally competent for DNA transformation, which is their main means of genetic exchange. Although bacteriophages and plasmids are present in this genus, they are not as effective as DNA transformation for horizontal genetic exchange. There are barriers to genetic transfer, such as restriction-modification systems and CRISPR loci, that limit particular types of exchange. These host-restricted pathogens illustrate the rich complexity of genetics that can help define the similarities and differences of closely related organisms.	E Rotman|HS Seifert
25250853	The ability to precisely modify genome sequence and regulate gene expression patterns in a site-specific manner holds much promise in plant biotechnology. Genome-engineering technologies that enable such highly specific and efficient modification are advancing with unprecedented pace. Transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) provide customizable DNA-binding modules designed to bind to any sequence of interest. Thus, TALEs have been used as a DNA targeting module fused to functional domains for a variety of targeted genomic and epigenomic modifications. TALE nucleases (TALENs) have been used with much success across eukaryotic species to edit genomes. Recently, clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) that are used as guide RNAs for Cas9 nuclease-specific digestion has been introduced as a highly efficient DNA-targeting platform for genome editing and regulation. Here, we review the discovery, development and limitations of TALENs and CRIPSR/Cas9 systems as genome-engineering platforms in plants. We discuss the current questions, potential improvements and the development of the next-generation genome-editing platforms with an emphasis on producing designer plants to address the needs of agriculture and basic plant biology.

25241743	The salamander is the only tetrapod that functionally regenerates all cell types of the limb and spinal cord (SC) and thus represents an important regeneration model, but the lack of gene-knockout technology has limited molecular analysis. We compared transcriptional activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) in the knockout of three loci in the axolotl and find that CRISPRs show highly penetrant knockout with less toxic effects compared to TALENs. Deletion of Sox2 in up to 100% of cells yielded viable F0 larvae with normal SC organization and ependymoglial cell marker expression such as GFAP and ZO-1. However, upon tail amputation, neural stem cell proliferation was inhibited, resulting in spinal-cord-specific regeneration failure. In contrast, the mesodermal blastema formed normally. Sox3 expression during development, but not regeneration, most likely allowed embryonic survival and the regeneration-specific phenotype. This analysis represents the first tissue-specific regeneration phenotype from the genomic deletion of a gene in the axolotl.	JF Fei|M Schuez|A Tazaki|Y Taniguchi|K Roensch|EM Tanaka
25241167	We developed an adenovirus-based CRISPR/Cas9 system for gene editing in vivo. In the liver, we demonstrated that the system could reach the level of tissue-specific gene knockout, resulting in phenotypic changes. Given the wide spectrum of cell types susceptible to adenoviral infection, and the fact that adenoviral genome rarely integrates into its host cell genome, we believe the adenovirus-based CRISPR/Cas9 system will find applications in a variety of experimental settings.

25239977	The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9 system has become a powerful and precise tool for targeted gene modification (e.g., gene knockout and gene replacement) in numerous eukaryotic organisms. Initial attempts to apply this technology to a model, the single-cell alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, failed to yield cells containing edited genes. To determine if the Cas9 and single guide RNA (sgRNA) genes were functional in C. reinhardtii, we tested the ability of a codon-optimized Cas9 gene along with one of four different sgRNAs to cause targeted gene disruption during a 24-h period immediately following transformation. All three exogenously supplied gene targets as well as the endogenous FKB12 (rapamycin sensitivity) gene of C. reinhardtii displayed distinct Cas9/sgRNA-mediated target site modifications as determined by DNA sequencing of cloned PCR amplicons of the target site region. Success in transient expression of Cas9 and sgRNA genes contrasted with the recovery of only a single rapamycin-resistant colony bearing an appropriately modified FKB12 target site in 16 independent transformation experiments involving >10(9) cells. Failure to recover transformants with intact or expressed Cas9 genes following transformation with the Cas9 gene alone (or even with a gene encoding a Cas9 lacking nuclease activity) provided strong suggestive evidence for Cas9 toxicity when Cas9 is produced constitutively in C. reinhardtii. The present results provide compelling evidence that Cas9 and sgRNA genes function properly in C. reinhardtii to cause targeted gene modifications and point to the need for a focus on development of methods to properly stem Cas9 production and/or activity following gene editing.

25232936	Targeted genome editing nucleases, such as zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), are powerful tools for understanding gene function and for developing valuable new traits in plants. The clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas system has recently emerged as an alternative nuclease-based method for efficient and versatile genome engineering. In this system, only the 20-nt targeting sequence within the single-guide RNA (sgRNA) needs to be changed to target different genes. The simplicity of the cloning strategy and the few limitations on potential target sites make the CRISPR/Cas system very appealing. Here we describe a stepwise protocol for the selection of target sites, as well as the design, construction, verification and use of sgRNAs for sequence-specific CRISPR/Cas-mediated mutagenesis and gene targeting in rice and wheat. The CRISPR/Cas system provides a straightforward method for rapid gene targeting within 1-2 weeks in protoplasts, and mutated rice plants can be generated within 13-17 weeks.	Q Shan|Y Wang|J Li|C Gao

25217846	Clostridium acetobutylicum is an important organism for biobutanol production. Due to frequent exposure to bacteriophages during fermentation, industrial C. acetobutylicum strains require a strong immune response against foreign genetic invaders. In the present study, a novel CRISPR system was reported in a C. acetobutylicum GXAS18-1 strain by whole genome sequencing, and several specific characteristics of the CRISPR system were revealed as follows: (1) multiple CRISPR loci were confirmed within the whole bacterial genome, while only one cluster of CRISPR-associated genes (Cas) was found in the current strain; (2) similar leader sequences at the 5' end of the multiple CRISPR loci were identified as promoter elements by promoter prediction, suggesting that these CRISPR loci were under the control of the same transcriptional factor; (3) homology analysis indicated that the present Cas genes shared only low sequence similarity with the published Cas families; and (4) concerning gene similarity and gene cluster order, these Cas genes belonged to the csm family and originated from the euryarchaeota by horizontal gene transfer.

25207793	One-step multiple gene disruption in the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a highly useful tool for both basic and applied research, but it remains a challenge. Here, we report a rapid, efficient, and potentially scalable strategy based on the type II Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR associated proteins (Cas) system to generate multiple gene disruptions simultaneously in S. cerevisiae. A 100 bp dsDNA mutagenizing homologous recombination donor is inserted between two direct repeats for each target gene in a CRISPR array consisting of multiple donor and guide sequence pairs. An ultrahigh copy number plasmid carrying iCas9, a variant of wild-type Cas9, trans-encoded RNA (tracrRNA), and a homology-integrated crRNA cassette is designed to greatly increase the gene disruption efficiency. As proof of concept, three genes, CAN1, ADE2, and LYP1, were simultaneously disrupted in 4 days with an efficiency ranging from 27 to 87%. Another three genes involved in an artificial hydrocortisone biosynthetic pathway, ATF2, GCY1, and YPR1, were simultaneously disrupted in 6 days with 100% efficiency. This homology-integrated CRISPR (HI-CRISPR) strategy represents a powerful tool for creating yeast strains with multiple gene knockouts.	Z Bao|H Xiao|J Liang|L Zhang|X Xiong|N Sun|T Si|H Zhao
25201946	The Gram-negative soil bacterium Myxococcus xanthus utilizes its social (S) gliding motility to move on surfaces during its vegetative and developmental cycles. It is known that S motility requires the type IV pilus (T4P) and the exopolysaccharide (EPS) to function. The T4P is the S motility motor, and it powers cell movement by retraction. As the key regulator of the S motor, EPS is proposed to be the anchor and trigger for T4P retraction. The production of EPS is regulated in turn by the T4P in M. xanthus, and T4P(-) mutants are S(-) and EPS(-). In this study, a ΔpilA strain (T4P(-) and EPS(-)) was mutagenized by a transposon and screened for EPS(+) mutants. A pilA suppressor isolated as such harbored an insertion in the 3rd clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR3) in M. xanthus. Evidence indicates that this transposon insertion, designated CRISPR3*, is a gain-of-function (GOF) mutation. Moreover, CRISPR3* eliminated developmental aggregation in both the wild-type and the pilA mutant backgrounds. Upstream of CRISPR3 are genes encoding the repeat-associated mysterious proteins (RAMPs). These RAMP genes are indispensable for CRISPR3* to affect development and EPS in M. xanthus. Analysis by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR suggested that CRISPR3* led to an increase in the processing of the RNA transcribed from CRISPR3. We propose that certain CRISPR3 transcripts, once expressed and processed, target genes critical for M. xanthus fruiting body development and EPS production in a RAMP-dependent manner.

25201645	Lactobacillus salivarius strains are increasingly being exploited for their probiotic properties in humans and animals. Dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes among species with food or probiotic-association is undesirable and is often mediated by plasmids or integrative and conjugative elements. L. salivarius strains typically have multireplicon genomes including circular megaplasmids that encode strain-specific traits for intestinal survival and probiotic activity. Linear plasmids are less common in lactobacilli and show a very limited distribution in L. salivarius. Here we present experimental evidence that supports an unusually complex multireplicon genome structure in the porcine isolate L. salivarius JCM1046.	JCM1046 harbours a 1.83 Mb chromosome, and four plasmids which constitute 20% of the genome. In addition to the known 219 kb repA-type megaplasmid pMP1046A, we identified and experimentally validated the topology of three additional replicons, the circular pMP1046B (129 kb), a linear plasmid pLMP1046 (101 kb) and pCTN1046 (33 kb) harbouring a conjugative transposon. pMP1046B harbours both plasmid-associated replication genes and paralogues of chromosomally encoded housekeeping and information-processing related genes, thus qualifying it as a putative chromid. pLMP1046 shares limited sequence homology or gene synteny with other L. salivarius plasmids, and its putative replication-associated protein is homologous to the RepA/E proteins found in the large circular megaplasmids of L. salivarius. Plasmid pCTN1046 harbours a single copy of an integrated conjugative transposon (Tn6224) which appears to be functionally intact and includes the tetracycline resistance gene tetM.	Experimental validation of sequence assemblies and plasmid topology resolved the complex genome architecture of L. salivarius JCM1046. A high-coverage draft genome sequence would not have elucidated the genome complexity in this strain. Given the expanding use of L. salivarius as a probiotic, it is important to determine the genotypic and phenotypic organization of L. salivarius strains. The identification of Tn6224-like elements in this species has implications for strain selection for probiotic applications.	EJ Raftis|BM Forde|MJ Claesson|PW O'Toole
25199561	The recently discovered CRISPRs (Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) and Cas (CRISPR-associated) proteins are a novel genetic barrier that limits horizontal gene transfer in prokaryotes and the CRISPR loci provide a historical view of the exposure of prokaryotes to a variety of foreign genetic elements. The aim of study was to investigate the occurrence and distribution of the CRISPRs in Shigella. A collection of 61 strains of Shigella were screened for the existence of CRISPRs. Three CRISPR loci were identified among 61 shigella strains. CRISPR1/cas loci are detected in 49 strains of shigella. Yet, IS elements were detected in cas gene in some strains. In the remaining 12 Shigella flexneri strains, the CRISPR1/cas locus is deleted and only a cas3' pseudo gene and a repeat sequence are present. The presence of CRISPR2 is frequently accompanied by the emergence of CRISPR1. CRISPR3 loci were present in almost all strains (52/61). The length of CRISPR arrays varied from 1 to 9 spacers. Sequence analysis of the CRISPR arrays revealed that few spacers had matches in the GenBank databases. However, one spacer in CRISPR3 loci matches the cognate cas3 genes and no cas gene was present around CRISPR3 region. Analysis of CRISPR sequences show that CRISPR have little change which makes CRISPR poor genotyping markers. The present study is the first attempt to determine and analyze CRISPRs of shigella isolated from clinical patients.	X Guo|Y Wang|G Duan|Z Xue|L Wang|P Wang|S Qiu|Y Xi|H Yang
25195632	Targeted genome editing of nonrodent mammalian species has provided the potential for highly accurate interventions into gene function in humans and the generation of useful animal models of human diseases. Here we show successful clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated (Cas)-mediated gene targeting via circular plasmid injection in rabbits. The rabbit tyrosinase gene (TYR) was effectively disrupted, and we confirmed germline transmission by pronuclear injection of a circular plasmid expressing humanized Cas9 (hCas9) and single-guide RNA. Direct injection into pronuclear stage zygotes was possible following an in vitro validation assay. Neither off-target mutagenesis nor hCas9 transgenesis was detected in any of the genetically targeted pups and embryos examined. Gene targeting with this rapid and simplified strategy will help accelerate the development of translational research using other nonrodent mammalian species.

25194339	Although CRISPR/Cas, a new versatile genome-editing tool, has been widely used in a variety of species including zebrafish, an important vertebrate model animal for biomedical research, the low efficiency of germline transmission of induced mutations and particularly knockin alleles made subsequent screening for heritable offspring tedious, time-consuming, expensive and at times impossible. In this study, we reported a method for improving the efficiency of germline transmission screening for generation of genome-edited zebrafish mutants. Co-microinjecting yfp-nanos3 mRNA with Cas9 mRNA, sgRNA and single strand DNA donor to label the distribution of microinjected nucleotides in PGCs (primordial germ cells), we demonstrated that founders carrying labeled PGCs produced much higher numbers of knockin and knockout progeny. In comparison with the common practice of selecting founders by genotyping fin clips, our new strategy of selecting founders with tentatively fluorescent-labeled PGCs significantly increase the ease and speed of generating heritable knocking and knockout animals with CRISPR/Cas9.

25193712	Genomic engineering by the guide RNA (gRNA)-directed CRISPR/CAS9 is rapidly becoming a method of choice for various biological systems. However, pressing concerns remain regarding its off-target activities and wide variations in efficacies. While next generation sequencing (NGS) has been primarily used to evaluate the efficacies and off-target activities of gRNAs, it only detects the imperfectly repaired double strand DNA breaks (DSB) by the error-prone non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) mechanism and may not faithfully represent the DSB activities because the efficiency of NHEJ-mediated repair varies depending on the local chromatin environment. Here we describe a reporter system for unbiased detection and comparison of DSB activities that promises to improve the chance of success in genomic engineering and to facilitate large-scale screening of CAS9 activities and gRNA libraries. Additionally, we demonstrated that the tolerances to mismatches between a gRNA and the corresponding target DNA can occur at any position of the gRNA, and depend on both specific gRNA sequences and CAS9 constructs used.

25186128	The human gastrointestinal tract represents an environment which is a densely populated home for a microbiota that has evolved to positively contribute to host health. At birth the essentially sterile gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is rapidly colonized by microorganisms that originate from the mother and the surrounding environment. Within a short timeframe a microbiota establishes within the (breastfed) infant's GIT where bifidobacteria are among the dominant members, although their numerical dominance disappears following weaning. The numerous health benefits associated with bifidobacteria, and the consequent commercial relevance resulting from their incorporation into functional foods, has led to intensified research aimed at the molecular understanding of claimed probiotic attributes of this genus. In this review we provide the current status on the diversity and ecology of bifidobacteria. In addition, we will discuss the molecular mechanisms that allow this intriguing group of bacteria to colonize and persist in the GIT, so as to facilitate interaction with its host.

25185700	Innovative new genome engineering technologies for manipulating chromosomes have appeared in the last decade. One of these technologies, recombination mediated genetic engineering (recombineering) allows for precision DNA engineering of chromosomes and plasmids in Escherichia coli. Single-stranded DNA recombineering (SSDR) allows for the generation of subtle mutations without the need for selection and without leaving behind any foreign DNA. In this review we discuss the application of SSDR technology in lactic acid bacteria, with an emphasis on key factors that were critical to move this technology from E. coli into Lactobacillus reuteri and Lactococcus lactis. We also provide a blueprint for how to proceed if one is attempting to establish SSDR technology in a lactic acid bacterium. The emergence of CRISPR-Cas technology in genome engineering and its potential application to enhancing SSDR in lactic acid bacteria is discussed.

25184674	The CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat)-Cas9 (CRISPR-associated nuclease 9) system is poised to transform developmental biology by providing a simple, efficient method to precisely manipulate the genome of virtually any developing organism. This RNA-guided nuclease (RGN)-based approach already has been effectively used to induce targeted mutations in multiple genes simultaneously, create conditional alleles, and generate endogenously tagged proteins. Illustrating the adaptability of RGNs, the genomes of >20 different plant and animal species as well as multiple cell lines and primary cells have been successfully modified. Here we review the current and potential uses of RGNs to investigate genome function during development.	MM Harrison|BV Jenkins|KM O'Connor-Giles|J Wildonger
25182226	We hypothesize herein that synthetic mitochondria, engineered, or reprogrammed to be more energetically efficient and to have mildly elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, would be an effective form of therapeutics against systemic aging. The free radical and mitochondria theories of aging hold that mitochondria-generated ROS underlies chronic organelle, cell and tissues damages that contribute to systemic aging. More recent findings, however, collectively suggest that while acute and massive ROS generation during events such as tissue injury is indeed detrimental, subacute stresses, and chronic elevation in ROS production may instead induce a state of mitochondrial hormesis (or "mitohormesis") that could extend lifespan. Mitohormesis appears to be a convergent mechanism for several known anti-aging signaling pathways. Importantly, mitohormetic signaling could also occur in a non-cell autonomous manner, with its induction in neurons affecting gut cells, for example. Technologies are outlined that could lead towards testing of the hypothesis, which include genetic and epigenetic engineering of the mitochondria, as well as intercellular transfer of mitochondria from transplanted helper cells to target tissues.

25174707	A fundamental feature of immune systems is the ability to distinguish pathogenic from self and commensal elements, and to attack the former but tolerate the latter. Prokaryotic CRISPR-Cas immune systems defend against phage infection by using Cas nucleases and small RNA guides that specify one or more target sites for cleavage of the viral genome. Temperate phages include viruses that can integrate into the bacterial chromosome, and they can carry genes that provide a fitness advantage to the lysogenic host. However, CRISPR-Cas targeting that relies strictly on DNA sequence recognition provides indiscriminate immunity both to lytic and lysogenic infection by temperate phages-compromising the genetic stability of these potentially beneficial elements altogether. Here we show that the Staphylococcus epidermidis CRISPR-Cas system can prevent lytic infection but tolerate lysogenization by temperate phages. Conditional tolerance is achieved through transcription-dependent DNA targeting, and ensures that targeting is resumed upon induction of the prophage lytic cycle. Our results provide evidence for the functional divergence of CRISPR-Cas systems and highlight the importance of targeting mechanism diversity. In addition, they extend the concept of 'tolerance to non-self' to the prokaryotic branch of adaptive immunity.	GW Goldberg|W Jiang|D Bikard|LA Marraffini

25170018	Polycomb-repressive complex 2 (PRC2) facilitates the maintenance and inheritance of chromatin domains repressive to transcription through catalysis of methylation of histone H3 at Lys27 (H3K27me2/3). However, through its EZH2 subunit, PRC2 also binds to nascent transcripts from active genes that are devoid of H3K27me2/3 in embryonic stem cells. Here, biochemical analyses indicated that RNA interaction inhibits SET domain-containing proteins, such as PRC2, nonspecifically in vitro. However, CRISPR-mediated truncation of a PRC2-interacting nascent RNA rescued PRC2-mediated deposition of H3K27me2/3. That PRC2 activity is inhibited by interactions with nascent transcripts supports a model in which PRC2 can only mark for repression those genes silenced by transcriptional repressors.

25166277	Designer nucleases such as TALENS and Cas9 have opened new opportunities to scarlessly edit the mammalian genome. Here we explored several parameters that influence Cas9-mediated scarless genome editing efficiency in murine embryonic stem cells. Optimization of transfection conditions and enriching for transfected cells are critical for efficiently recovering modified clones. Paired gRNAs and wild-type Cas9 efficiently create programmed deletions, which facilitate identification of targeted clones, while paired gRNAs and the Cas9D10A nickase generated smaller targeted indels with lower chance of off-target mutagenesis. Genome editing is also useful for programmed introduction of exogenous DNA sequences at a target locus. Increasing the length of the homology arms of the homology-directed repair template strongly enhanced targeting efficiency, while increasing the length of the DNA insert reduced it. Together our data provide guidance on optimal design of scarless gene knockout, modification, or knock-in experiments using Cas9 nuclease.	K Li|G Wang|T Andersen|P Zhou|WT Pu
25163683	For well over a decade, RNA interference (RNAi) has provided a powerful tool for investigators to query specific gene targets in an easily modulated loss-of-function setting, both in vitro and in vivo. Hundreds of publications have demonstrated the utility of RNAi in arrayed and pooled-based formats, in a wide variety of cell-based systems, including clonal, stem, transformed, and primary cells. Over the years, there have been significant improvements in the design of target-specific small-interfering RNA (siRNA) and short-hairpin RNA (shRNA), expression vectors, methods for mitigating off-target effects, and accurately interpreting screening results. Recent developments in RNAi technology include the Sensor assay, high-efficiency miR-E shRNAs, improved shRNA virus production with Pasha (DRGC8) knockdown, and assessment of RNAi off-target effects by using the C9-11 method. An exciting addition to the arsenal of RNA-mediated gene modulation is the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/Cas9 (CRISPR/Cas) system for genomic editing, allowing for gene functional knockout rather than knockdown.

25161238	The discovery of CRISPR-Cas systems almost 20 years ago rapidly changed our perception of the bacterial and archaeal immune systems. CRISPR loci consist of several repetitive DNA sequences called repeats, inter-spaced by stretches of variable length sequences called spacers. This CRISPR array is transcribed and processed into multiple mature RNA species (crRNAs). A single crRNA is integrated into an interference complex, together with CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins, to bind and degrade invading nucleic acids. Although existing bioinformatics tools can recognize CRISPR loci by their characteristic repeat-spacer architecture, they generally output CRISPR arrays of ambiguous orientation and thus do not determine the strand from which crRNAs are processed. Knowledge of the correct orientation is crucial for many tasks, including the classification of CRISPR conservation, the detection of leader regions, the identification of target sites (protospacers) on invading genetic elements and the characterization of protospacer-adjacent motifs.	We present a fast and accurate tool to determine the crRNA-encoding strand at CRISPR loci by predicting the correct orientation of repeats based on an advanced machine learning approach. Both the repeat sequence and mutation information were encoded and processed by an efficient graph kernel to learn higher-order correlations. The model was trained and tested on curated data comprising >4500 CRISPRs and yielded a remarkable performance of 0.95 AUC ROC (area under the curve of the receiver operator characteristic). In addition, we show that accurate orientation information greatly improved detection of conserved repeat sequence families and structure motifs. We integrated CRISPRstrand predictions into our CRISPRmap web server of CRISPR conservation and updated the latter to version 2.0.

25161187	Clostridium difficile is an important human-pathogenic bacterium causing antibiotic-associated nosocomial infections worldwide. Mobile genetic elements and bacteriophages have helped shape C. difficile genome evolution. In many bacteria, phage infection may be controlled by a form of bacterial immunity called the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated (CRISPR/Cas) system. This uses acquired short nucleotide sequences (spacers) to target homologous sequences (protospacers) in phage genomes. C. difficile carries multiple CRISPR arrays, and in this paper we examine the relationships between the host- and phage-carried elements of the system. We detected multiple matches between spacers and regions in 31 C. difficile phage and prophage genomes. A subset of the spacers was located in prophage-carried CRISPR arrays. The CRISPR spacer profiles generated suggest that related phages would have similar host ranges. Furthermore, we show that C. difficile strains of the same ribotype could either have similar or divergent CRISPR contents. Both synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations in the protospacer sequences were identified, as well as differences in the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), which could explain how phages escape this system. This paper illustrates how the distribution and diversity of CRISPR spacers in C. difficile, and its prophages, could modulate phage predation for this pathogen and impact upon its evolution and pathogenicity.	Clostridium difficile is a significant bacterial human pathogen which undergoes continual genome evolution, resulting in the emergence of new virulent strains. Phages are major facilitators of genome evolution in other bacterial species, and we use sequence analysis-based approaches in order to examine whether the CRISPR/Cas system could control these interactions across divergent C. difficile strains. The presence of spacer sequences in prophages that are homologous to phage genomes raises an extra level of complexity in this predator-prey microbial system. Our results demonstrate that the impact of phage infection in this system is widespread and that the CRISPR/Cas system is likely to be an important aspect of the evolutionary dynamics in C. difficile.

25157128	Latent viral infection is a persistent cause of human disease. Although standard antiviral therapies can suppress active viral replication, no existing treatment can effectively eradicate latent infection and therefore a cure is lacking for many prevalent viral diseases. The prokaryotic immune system clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas evolved as a natural response to phage infections, and we demonstrate here that the CRISPR/Cas9 system can be adapted for antiviral treatment in human cells by specifically targeting the genomes of latent viral infections. Patient-derived cells from a Burkitt's lymphoma with latent Epstein-Barr virus infection showed dramatic proliferation arrest and a concomitant decrease in viral load after exposure to a CRISPR/Cas9 vector targeted to the viral genome.

25155957	One of the most powerful ways to test the function of a protein is to characterize the consequences of its deletion. In the past, this has involved inactivation of the gene by homologous recombination either in the germline or later through conditional deletion. RNA interference (RNAi) provides an alternative way to knock down proteins, but both of these approaches have their limitations. Recently, the CRISPR/Cas9 system has suggested another way to selectively inactivate genes. We have now tested this system in postmitotic neurons by targeting two well-characterized synaptic proteins, the obligatory GluN1 subunit of the NMDA receptor and the GluA2 subunit of the AMPA receptor. Expression of CRISPR/Cas9 in hippocampal slice cultures completely eliminated NMDA receptor and GluA2 function. CRISPR/Cas9 thus provides a powerful tool to study the function of synaptic proteins.

25155554	Conditional gene knockout animals are valuable tools for studying the mechanisms underlying cell and developmental biology. We developed a conditional knockout strategy by spatiotemporally manipulating the expression of an RNA-guided DNA endonuclease, CRISPR-Cas9, in Caenorhabditis elegans somatic cell lineages. We showed that this somatic CRISPR-Cas9 technology provides a quick and efficient approach to generate conditional knockouts in various cell types at different developmental stages. Furthermore, we demonstrated that this method outperforms our recently developed somatic TALEN technique and enables the one-step generation of multiple conditional knockouts. By combining these techniques with live-cell imaging, we showed that an essential embryonic gene, Coronin, which is associated with human neurobehavioral dysfunction, regulates actin organization and cell morphology during C. elegans postembryonic neuroblast migration and neuritogenesis. We propose that the somatic CRISPR-Cas9 platform is uniquely suited for conditional gene editing-based biomedical research.	Z Shen|X Zhang|Y Chai|Z Zhu|P Yi|G Feng|W Li|G Ou
25151162	The zebrafish model organism is well suited to study the role of specific genes, such as hox genes, in embryogenesis and organ function. The ability to modulate the activity of hox genes in living zebrafish embryos represents a cornerstone of such functional analyses. In this chapter we outline the basic methodology for nucleic acid injections into 1-2-cell-stage zebrafish embryos. We also report variations in this method to allow injection of mRNA, DNA, and antisense oligonucleotides to either overexpress, knock down, or knock out specific genes in zebrafish embryos.

25148031	CRISPR-Cas systems provide immunity against viral attacks in archaeal and bacterial cells. Type I systems employ a Cas protein complex termed Cascade, which utilizes small CRISPR RNAs to detect and degrade the exogenic DNA. A small sequence motif, the PAM, marks the foreign substrates. Previously, a recombinant type I-A Cascade complex from the archaeon Thermoproteus tenax was shown to target and degrade DNA in vitro, dependent on a native PAM sequence. Here, we present the biochemical analysis of the small subunit, Csa5, of this Cascade complex. T. tenax Csa5 preferentially bound ssDNA and mutants that showed decreased ssDNA-binding and reduced Cascade-mediated DNA cleavage were identified. Csa5 oligomerization prevented DNA binding. Specific recognition of the PAM sequence was not observed. Phylogenetic analyses identified Csa5 as a universal member of type I-A systems and revealed three distinct groups. A potential role of Csa5 in R-loop stabilization is discussed.	M Daume|A Plagens|L Randau
25147920	Any given chromosomal activity (e.g., transcription) is governed predominantly by the local epiproteome. However, defining local epiproteomes has been limited by a lack of effective technologies to isolate discrete sections of chromatin and to identify with precision specific proteins and histone posttranslational modifications (PTMs). We report the use of the Cas9 and guide RNA (gRNA) components of the CRISPR system for gRNA-directed purification of a discrete section of chromatin. Quantitative mass spectrometry provides for unambiguous identification of proteins and histone PTMs specifically associated with the enriched chromatin. This CRISPR-based Chromatin Affinity Purification with Mass Spectrometry (CRISPR-ChAP-MS) approach revealed changes in the local epiproteome of a promoter during activation of transcription. CRISPR-ChAP-MS thus has broad applications for discovering molecular components and dynamic regulation of any in vivo activity at a given chromosomal location.

25141179	Saturation mutagenesis--coupled to an appropriate biological assay--represents a fundamental means of achieving a high-resolution understanding of regulatory and protein-coding nucleic acid sequences of interest. However, mutagenized sequences introduced in trans on episomes or via random or "safe-harbour" integration fail to capture the native context of the endogenous chromosomal locus. This shortcoming markedly limits the interpretability of the resulting measurements of mutational impact. Here, we couple CRISPR/Cas9 RNA-guided cleavage with multiplex homology-directed repair using a complex library of donor templates to demonstrate saturation editing of genomic regions. In exon 18 of BRCA1, we replace a six-base-pair (bp) genomic region with all possible hexamers, or the full exon with all possible single nucleotide variants (SNVs), and measure strong effects on transcript abundance attributable to nonsense-mediated decay and exonic splicing elements. We similarly perform saturation genome editing of a well-conserved coding region of an essential gene, DBR1, and measure relative effects on growth that correlate with functional impact. Measurement of the functional consequences of large numbers of mutations with saturation genome editing will potentially facilitate high-resolution functional dissection of both cis-regulatory elements and trans-acting factors, as well as the interpretation of variants of uncertain significance observed in clinical sequencing.

25139909	The directed evolution of biomolecules to improve or change their activity is central to many engineering and synthetic biology efforts. However, selecting improved variants from gene libraries in living cells requires plasmid expression systems that suffer from variable copy number effects, or the use of complex marker-dependent chromosomal integration strategies. We developed quantitative gene assembly and DNA library insertion into the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome by optimizing an efficient single-step and marker-free genome editing system using CRISPR-Cas9. With this Multiplex CRISPR (CRISPRm) system, we selected an improved cellobiose utilization pathway in diploid yeast in a single round of mutagenesis and selection, which increased cellobiose fermentation rates by over 10-fold. Mutations recovered in the best cellodextrin transporters reveal synergy between substrate binding and transporter dynamics, and demonstrate the power of CRISPRm to accelerate selection experiments and discoveries of the molecular determinants that enhance biomolecule function.

25135198	MicroRNA (miRNA) target recognition is largely dictated by short 'seed' sequences, and single miRNAs therefore have the potential to regulate a large number of genes. Understanding the contribution of specific miRNA-target interactions to the regulation of biological processes in vivo remains challenging. Here we use transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9 technologies to interrogate the functional relevance of predicted miRNA response elements (MREs) to post-transcriptional silencing in zebrafish and Drosophila. We also demonstrate an effective strategy that uses CRISPR-mediated homology-directed repair with short oligonucleotide donors for the assessment of MRE activity in human cells. These methods facilitate analysis of the direct phenotypic consequences resulting from blocking specific miRNA-MRE interactions at any point during development.

25128437	Recent studies of the Cas9/sgRNA system in Drosophila melanogaster genome editing have opened new opportunities to generate site-specific mutant collections in a high-throughput manner. However, off-target effects of the system are still a major concern when analyzing mutant phenotypes. Mutations converting Cas9 to a DNA nickase have great potential for reducing off-target effects in vitro. Here, we demonstrated that injection of two plasmids encoding neighboring offset sgRNAs into transgenic Cas9(D10A) nickase flies efficiently produces heritable indel mutants. We then determined the effective distance between the two sgRNA targets and their orientations that affected the ability of the sgRNA pairs to generate mutations when expressed in the transgenic nickase flies. Interestingly, Cas9 nickase greatly reduces the ability to generate mutants with one sgRNA, suggesting that the application of Cas9 nickase and sgRNA pairs can almost avoid off-target effects when generating indel mutants. Finally, a defined piwi mutant allele is generated with this system through homology-directed repair. However, Cas9(D10A) is not as effective as Cas9 in replacing the entire coding sequence of piwi with two sgRNAs.	X Ren|Z Yang|D Mao|Z Chang|HH Qiao|X Wang|J Sun|Q Hu|Y Cui|LP Liu|JY Ji|J Xu|JQ Ni
25124552	A seventh order of methanogens, the Methanomassiliicoccales, has been identified in diverse anaerobic environments including the gastrointestinal tracts (GIT) of humans and other animals and may contribute significantly to methane emission and global warming. Methanomassiliicoccales are phylogenetically distant from all other orders of methanogens and belong to a large evolutionary branch composed by lineages of non-methanogenic archaea such as Thermoplasmatales, the Deep Hydrothermal Vent Euryarchaeota-2 (DHVE-2, Aciduliprofundum boonei) and the Marine Group-II (MG-II). To better understand this new order and its relationship to other archaea, we manually curated and extensively compared the genome sequences of three Methanomassiliicoccales representatives derived from human GIT microbiota, "Candidatus Methanomethylophilus alvus", "Candidatus Methanomassiliicoccus intestinalis" and Methanomassiliicoccus luminyensis.	Comparative analyses revealed atypical features, such as the scattering of the ribosomal RNA genes in the genome and the absence of eukaryotic-like histone gene otherwise present in most of Euryarchaeota genomes. Previously identified in Thermoplasmatales genomes, these features are presently extended to several completely sequenced genomes of this large evolutionary branch, including MG-II and DHVE2. The three Methanomassiliicoccales genomes share a unique composition of genes involved in energy conservation suggesting an original combination of two main energy conservation processes previously described in other methanogens. They also display substantial differences with each other, such as their codon usage, the nature and origin of their CRISPRs systems and the genes possibly involved in particular environmental adaptations. The genome of M. luminyensis encodes several features to thrive in soil and sediment conditions suggesting its larger environmental distribution than GIT. Conversely, "Ca. M. alvus" and "Ca. M. intestinalis" do not present these features and could be more restricted and specialized on GIT. Prediction of the amber codon usage, either as a termination signal of translation or coding for pyrrolysine revealed contrasted patterns among the three genomes and suggests a different handling of the Pyl-encoding capacity.	This study represents the first insights into the genomic organization and metabolic traits of the seventh order of methanogens. It suggests contrasted evolutionary history among the three analyzed Methanomassiliicoccales representatives and provides information on conserved characteristics among the overall methanogens and among Thermoplasmata.

25123481	In prokaryotes, RNA derived from type I and type III CRISPR loci direct large ribonucleoprotein complexes to destroy invading bacteriophage and plasmids. In Escherichia coli, this 405-kilodalton complex is called Cascade. We report the crystal structure of Cascade bound to a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) target at a resolution of 3.03 angstroms. The structure reveals that the CRISPR RNA and target strands do not form a double helix but instead adopt an underwound ribbon-like structure. This noncanonical structure is facilitated by rotation of every sixth nucleotide out of the RNA-DNA hybrid and is stabilized by the highly interlocked organization of protein subunits. These studies provide insight into both the assembly and the activity of this complex and suggest a mechanism to enforce fidelity of target binding.	S Mulepati|A Héroux|S Bailey
25119044	The study of cancer genes in mouse models has traditionally relied on genetically-engineered strains made via transgenesis or gene targeting in embryonic stem cells. Here we describe a new method of cancer model generation using the CRISPR/Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated proteins) system in vivo in wild-type mice. We used hydrodynamic injection to deliver a CRISPR plasmid DNA expressing Cas9 and single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) to the liver that directly target the tumour suppressor genes Pten (ref. 5) and p53 (also known as TP53 and Trp53) (ref. 6), alone and in combination. CRISPR-mediated Pten mutation led to elevated Akt phosphorylation and lipid accumulation in hepatocytes, phenocopying the effects of deletion of the gene using Cre-LoxP technology. Simultaneous targeting of Pten and p53 induced liver tumours that mimicked those caused by Cre-loxP-mediated deletion of Pten and p53. DNA sequencing of liver and tumour tissue revealed insertion or deletion mutations of the tumour suppressor genes, including bi-allelic mutations of both Pten and p53 in tumours. Furthermore, co-injection of Cas9 plasmids harbouring sgRNAs targeting the β-catenin gene and a single-stranded DNA oligonucleotide donor carrying activating point mutations led to the generation of hepatocytes with nuclear localization of β-catenin. This study demonstrates the feasibility of direct mutation of tumour suppressor genes and oncogenes in the liver using the CRISPR/Cas system, which presents a new avenue for rapid development of liver cancer models and functional genomics.

25116387	The evolution from microarrays to transcriptome deep-sequencing (RNA-seq) and from RNA interference to gene knockouts using Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPRs) and Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases (TALENs) has provided a new experimental partnership for identifying and quantifying the effects of gene changes on drug resistance. Here we describe the results from deep-sequencing of RNA derived from two cytarabine (Ara-C) resistance acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines, and present CRISPR and TALEN based methods for accomplishing complete gene knockout (KO) in AML cells. We found protein modifying loss-of-function mutations in Dck in both Ara-C resistant cell lines. CRISPR and TALEN-based KO of Dck dramatically increased the IC₅₀ of Ara-C and introduction of a DCK overexpression vector into Dck KO clones resulted in a significant increase in Ara-C sensitivity. This effort demonstrates the power of using transcriptome analysis and CRISPR/TALEN-based KOs to identify and verify genes associated with drug resistance.

25108866	Salmonella enterica ssp. enterica is a foodborne pathogen able to cause disease in both humans and animals. Diverse serovars of this pathogen exist, some of which are host specific, causing a range of clinical symptoms from asymptomatic infection through morbidity and mortality. According to a 2007 survey by the USDA National Animal Health Monitoring System, fecal shedding of Salmonella from healthy cows occurs on 39.7% of dairy farms in the United States. Certain serovars are frequently isolated from dairy farms and the majority of isolates from the National Animal Health Monitoring System study were represented by 5 serovars; however, genotypic diversity was not examined. The objective of this study was to determine the diversity of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) loci in Salmonella collected from 8 dairy farms with a previous history of salmonellosis. None of the cows or calves sampled on 2 of the 8 dairy farms were shedding Salmonella, although Salmonella was detected in a cow bedding sample on 1 of these farms. Salmonella populations were discrete on each farm, according to CRISPR typing, with the exception of an Anatum var. 15+ type on farms 5 and 6 and the Montevideo type on farms 1 and 2. One to 4 distinct CRISPR genotypes were identified per farm. The CRISPR typing differed within serovars, as Montevideo, Anatum var. 15+, and Muenster serovars had no overlap of spacer content, even on the same farm, reflecting between- and within-serovar genetic diversity. The dynamic nature of Salmonella populations was shown in a farm that was sampled longitudinally over 13.5 mo. Changes in serovar from 3,19:-:z27 to Montevideo was observed between the first sampling time and 8 mo later, with concomitant change in CRISPR alleles. The results indicate that Salmonella strains present in smaller dairy herds (<500 head) are specific to that farm and new Salmonella strains may emerge over time.

25105359	The repurposed CRISPR-Cas9 system has recently emerged as a revolutionary genome-editing tool. Here we report a modification in the expression of the guide RNA (gRNA) required for targeting that greatly expands the targetable genome. gRNA expression through the commonly used U6 promoter requires a guanosine nucleotide to initiate transcription, thus constraining genomic-targeting sites to GN19NGG. We demonstrate the ability to modify endogenous genes using H1 promoter-expressed gRNAs, which can be used to target both AN19NGG and GN19NGG genomic sites. AN19NGG sites occur ~15% more frequently than GN19NGG sites in the human genome and the increase in targeting space is also enriched at human genes and disease loci. Together, our results enhance the versatility of the CRISPR technology by more than doubling the number of targetable sites within the human genome and other eukaryotic species.

25104401	Various biological molecules naturally existing in diversified species including fungi, bacteria, and bacteriophage have functionalities for DNA binding and processing. The biological molecules have been recently actively engineered for use in customized genome editing of mammalian cells as the molecule-encoding DNA sequence information and the underlying mechanisms how the molecules work are unveiled. Excitingly, multiple novel methods based on the newly constructed artificial molecular tools have enabled modifications of specific endogenous genetic elements in the genome context at efficiencies that are much higher than that of the conventional homologous recombination based methods. This minireview introduces the most recently spotlighted molecular genome engineering tools with their key features and ongoing modifications for better performance. Such ongoing efforts have mainly focused on the removal of the inherent DNA sequence recognition rigidity from the original molecular platforms, the addition of newly tailored targeting functions into the engineered molecules, and the enhancement of their targeting specificity. Effective targeted genome engineering of mammalian cells will enable not only sophisticated genetic studies in the context of the genome, but also widely-applicable universal therapeutics based on the pinpointing and correction of the disease-causing genetic elements within the genome in the near future.

25103409	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) are essential components of RNA-guided adaptive immune systems that protect bacteria and archaea from viruses and plasmids. In Escherichia coli, short CRISPR-derived RNAs (crRNAs) assemble into a 405-kilodalton multisubunit surveillance complex called Cascade (CRISPR-associated complex for antiviral defense). Here we present the 3.24 angstrom resolution x-ray crystal structure of Cascade. Eleven proteins and a 61-nucleotide crRNA assemble into a seahorse-shaped architecture that binds double-stranded DNA targets complementary to the crRNA-guide sequence. Conserved sequences on the 3' and 5' ends of the crRNA are anchored by proteins at opposite ends of the complex, whereas the guide sequence is displayed along a helical assembly of six interwoven subunits that present five-nucleotide segments of the crRNA in pseudo-A-form configuration. The structure of Cascade suggests a mechanism for assembly and provides insights into the mechanisms of target recognition.

25103210	CRISPR is a microbial immune system likely to be involved in host-parasite coevolution. It functions using target sequences encoded by the bacterial genome, which interfere with invading nucleic acids using a homology-dependent system. The system also requires protospacer associated motifs (PAMs), short motifs close to the target sequence that are required for interference in CRISPR types I and II. Here, we investigate whether PAMs are depleted in phage genomes due to selection pressure to escape recognition.	To this end, we analyzed two data sets. Phages infecting all bacterial hosts were analyzed first, followed by a detailed analysis of phages infecting the genus Streptococcus, where PAMs are best understood. We use two different measures of motif underrepresentation that control for codon bias and the frequency of submotifs. We compare phages infecting species with a particular CRISPR type to those infecting species without that type. Since only known PAMs were investigated, the analysis is restricted to CRISPR types I-C and I-E and in Streptococcus to types I-C and II. We found evidence for PAM depletion in Streptococcus phages infecting hosts with CRISPR type I-C, in Vibrio phages infecting hosts with CRISPR type I-E and in Streptococcus thermopilus phages infecting hosts with type II-A, known as CRISPR3.	The observed motif depletion in phages with hosts having CRISPR can be attributed to selection rather than to mutational bias, as mutational bias should affect the phages of all hosts. This observation implies that the CRISPR system has been efficient in the groups discussed here.	A Kupczok|JP Bollback
25100830	High-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs), including HPV-16 and HPV-18, are the causative agents of cervical carcinomas and are linked to several other tumors of the anogenital and oropharyngeal regions. The majority of HPV-induced tumors contain integrated copies of the normally episomal HPV genome that invariably retain intact forms of the two HPV oncogenes E6 and E7. E6 induces degradation of the cellular tumor suppressor p53, while E7 destabilizes the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein. Previous work has shown that loss of E6 function in cervical cancer cells induces p53 expression as well as downstream effectors that induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Similarly, loss of E7 allows increased Rb expression, leading to cell cycle arrest and senescence. Here, we demonstrate that expression of a bacterial Cas9 RNA-guided endonuclease, together with single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) specific for E6 or E7, is able to induce cleavage of the HPV genome, resulting in the introduction of inactivating deletion and insertion mutations into the E6 or E7 gene. This results in the induction of p53 or Rb, leading to cell cycle arrest and eventual cell death. Both HPV-16- and HPV-18-transformed cells were found to be responsive to targeted HPV genome-specific DNA cleavage. These data provide a proof of principle for the idea that vector-delivered Cas9/sgRNA combinations could represent effective treatment modalities for HPV-induced cancers. Importance: Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are the causative agents of almost all cervical carcinomas and many other tumors, including many head and neck cancers. In these cancer cells, the HPV DNA genome is integrated into the cellular genome, where it expresses high levels of two viral oncogenes, called E6 and E7, that are required for cancer cell growth and viability. Here, we demonstrate that the recently described bacterial CRISPR/Cas RNA-guided endonuclease can be reprogrammed to target and destroy the E6 or E7 gene in cervical carcinoma cells transformed by HPV, resulting in cell cycle arrest, leading to cancer cell death. We propose that viral vectors designed to deliver E6- and/or E7-specific CRISPR/Cas to tumor cells could represent a novel and highly effective tool to treat and eliminate HPV-induced cancers.

25089276	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated protein (Cas) system facilitates targeted genome editing in organisms. Despite high demand of this system, finding a reliable tool for the determination of specific target sites in large genomic data remained challenging.

25085494	Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri (Xac) is the causal agent of citrus bacterial canker (CBC) and is a serious problem worldwide. Like CBC, several important diseases in other fruits, such as mango, pomegranate, and grape, are also caused by Xanthomonas pathovars that display remarkable specificity toward their hosts. While citrus and mango diseases were documented more than 100 years ago, the pomegranate and grape diseases have been known only since the 1950s and 1970s, respectively. Interestingly, diseases caused by all these pathovars were noted first in India. Our genome-based phylogenetic studies suggest that these diverse pathogens belong to a single species and these pathovars may be just a group of rapidly evolving strains. Furthermore, the recently reported pathovars, such as those infecting grape and pomegranate, form independent clonal lineages, while the citrus and mango pathovars that have been known for a long time form one clonal lineage. Such an understanding of their phylogenomic relationship has further allowed us to understand major and unique variations in the lineages that give rise to these pathovars. Whole-genome sequencing studies including ecological relatives from their putative country of origin has allowed us to understand the evolutionary history of Xac and other pathovars that infect fruits.

25085493	Bifidobacteria represent one of the dominant microbial groups that are present in the gut of various animals, being particularly prevalent during the suckling stage of life of humans and other mammals. However, the overall genome structure of this group of microorganisms remains largely unexplored. Here, we sequenced the genomes of 42 representative (sub)species across the Bifidobacterium genus and used this information to explore the overall genetic picture of this bacterial group. Furthermore, the genomic data described here were used to reconstruct the evolutionary development of the Bifidobacterium genus. This reconstruction suggests that its evolution was substantially influenced by genetic adaptations to obtain access to glycans, thereby representing a common and potent evolutionary force in shaping bifidobacterial genomes.

25079131	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins constitute an RNA-guided microbial defense system against invading foreign genetic materials. Cas2 is one of the core Cas proteins found universally in all the subtypes of CRISPR-Cas systems and is required for incorporating new spacers into CRISPR loci. Cas2 homologues from different CRISPR-Cas subtypes were characterized previously as metal-dependent nucleases with different substrate preferences, and it was proposed that a pH-dependent conformational change mediates metal binding and catalysis. Here, we report the crystal structures of Streptococcus pyogenes Cas2 at three different pHs (5.6, 6.5, and 7.5), as well as the results of its nuclease activity assay against double-stranded DNAs at varying pHs (6.0-9.0). Although S. pyogenes Cas2 exhibited strongly pH-dependent catalytic activity, there was no significant conformational difference among the three crystal structures. However, structural comparisons with other Cas2 homologues revealed structural variability and the flexible nature of its putative hinge regions, supporting the hypothesis that conformational switching is important for catalysis. Taken together, our results confirm that Cas2 proteins have pH-dependent nuclease activity against double-stranded DNAs, and provide indirect structural evidence for their conformational changes.

25063295	Bacteriophages are now widely recognized as major players in a wide variety of ecosystems. Novel genes are often identified in newly isolated phages as well as in environmental metavirome studies. Most of these novel viral genes have unknown functions but appear to be coding for small, non-structural proteins. To understand their biological role, very efficient genetic tools are required to modify them, especially in the genome of virulent phages. We first show that specific point mutations and large deletions can be engineered in the genome of the virulent phage 2972 using the Streptococcus thermophilus CRISPR-Cas Type II-A system as a selective pressure to increase recombination efficiencies. Of significance, all the plaques tested contained recombinant phages with the desired mutation. Furthermore, we show that the CRISPR-Cas engineering system can be used to efficiently introduce a functional methyltransferase gene into a virulent phage genome. Finally, synthetic CRISPR bacteriophage insensitive mutants were constructed by cloning a spacer-repeat unit in a low-copy vector illustrating the possibility to target multiple regions of the phage genome. Taken together, this data shows that the CRISPR-Cas system is an efficient and adaptable tool for editing the otherwise intractable genomes of virulent phages and to better understand phage-host interactions.

25059373	To detect the distribution of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) associated protein genes cas1 and cas2 in Shigella and to understand the characteristics of CRISPR with relationship between CRISPR and related characteristics on drug resistance.	CRISPR associated protein genes cas1 and cas2 in Shigella were detected by PCR, with its products sequenced and compared.	The CRISPR-associated protein genes cas1 and cas2 were found in all the 196 Shigella isolates which were isolated at different times and locations in China. Consistencies showed through related sequencing appeared as follows: cas2, cas1 (a) and cas1 (b) were 96.44%, 97.61% and 96.97%, respectively. There were two mutations including 3177129 site(C→G)and 3177126 site (G→C) of cas1 (b) gene in 2003135 strain which were not found in the corresponding sites of Z23 and 2008113.	showed that in terms of both susceptibility and antibiotic-resistance, strain 2003135 was stronger than Z23 and 2008113.	CRISPR system widely existed in Shigella, with the level of drug resistance in cas1 (b) gene mutant strains higher than in wild strains. Cas1 (b) gene mutation might be one of the reasons causing the different levels of resistance.	Z Xue|Y Wang|G Duan|P Wang|L Wang|X Guo|Y Xi
25058643	Mice with specific gene modifications are valuable tools for studying development and disease. Traditional gene targeting in mice using embryonic stem (ES) cells, although suitable for generating sophisticated genetic modifications in endogenous genes, is complex and time-consuming. We have recently described CRISPR/Cas-mediated genome engineering for the generation of mice carrying mutations in multiple genes, endogenous reporters, conditional alleles or defined deletions. Here we provide a detailed protocol for embryo manipulation by piezo-driven injection of nucleic acids into the cytoplasm to create gene-modified mice. Beginning with target design, the generation of gene-modified mice can be achieved in as little as 4 weeks. We also describe the application of the CRISPR/Cas technology for the simultaneous editing of multiple genes (five genes or more) after a single transfection of ES cells. The principles described in this protocol have already been applied in rats and primates, and they are applicable to sophisticated genome engineering in species in which ES cells are not available.

25058116	Metagenomics, or sequencing of the genetic material from a complete microbial community, is a promising tool to discover novel microbes and viruses. Viral metagenomes typically contain many unknown sequences. Here we describe the discovery of a previously unidentified bacteriophage present in the majority of published human faecal metagenomes, which we refer to as crAssphage. Its ~97 kbp genome is six times more abundant in publicly available metagenomes than all other known phages together; it comprises up to 90% and 22% of all reads in virus-like particle (VLP)-derived metagenomes and total community metagenomes, respectively; and it totals 1.68% of all human faecal metagenomic sequencing reads in the public databases. The majority of crAssphage-encoded proteins match no known sequences in the database, which is why it was not detected before. Using a new co-occurrence profiling approach, we predict a Bacteroides host for this phage, consistent with Bacteroides-related protein homologues and a unique carbohydrate-binding domain encoded in the phage genome.

25051498	Isolation of specific genomic regions retaining molecular interactions is essential for comprehensive identification of molecules associated with the genomic regions. Recently, we developed the engineered DNA-binding molecule-mediated chromatin immunoprecipitation (enChIP) technology for purification of specific genomic regions. Here, we developed a retroviral expression system for enChIP using CRISPR. We showed that the target genomic locus can be purified with high efficiency by using this system. We also showed that contamination of potential off-target sites is negligible by using this system if the guide RNA (gRNA) for the target site has a sufficiently long unique sequence in its seed sequence. enChIP combined with stable isotope labeling using amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) analysis identified proteins whose association with the interferon (IFN) regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) promoter region increases in response to IFNγ stimulation. The list of the associated proteins contained many novel proteins in the context of IFNγ-induced gene expression as well as proteins related to histone deacetylase complexes whose involvement has been suggested in IFNγ-mediated gene expression. Finally, we confirmed IFNγ-induced increased association of the identified proteins with the IRF-1 promoter by ChIP. Thus, our results showed that the retroviral enChIP system using CRISPR would be useful for biochemical analysis of genome functions including transcription and epigenetic regulation.

25049410	AIDS remains incurable due to the permanent integration of HIV-1 into the host genome, imparting risk of viral reactivation even after antiretroviral therapy. New strategies are needed to ablate the viral genome from latently infected cells, because current methods are too inefficient and prone to adverse off-target effects. To eliminate the integrated HIV-1 genome, we used the Cas9/guide RNA (gRNA) system, in single and multiplex configurations. We identified highly specific targets within the HIV-1 LTR U3 region that were efficiently edited by Cas9/gRNA, inactivating viral gene expression and replication in latently infected microglial, promonocytic, and T cells. Cas9/gRNAs caused neither genotoxicity nor off-target editing to the host cells, and completely excised a 9,709-bp fragment of integrated proviral DNA that spanned from its 5' to 3' LTRs. Furthermore, the presence of multiplex gRNAs within Cas9-expressing cells prevented HIV-1 infection. Our results suggest that Cas9/gRNA can be engineered to provide a specific, efficacious prophylactic and therapeutic approach against AIDS.

25044113	Deregulated expression of high-risk human papillomavirus oncogenes (E6 and E7) is a pivotal event for pathogenesis and progression in cervical cancer. Both viral oncogenes are therefore regarded as ideal therapeutic targets. In the hope of developing a gene-specific therapy for HPV-related cancer, we established CRISPR/Cas9 targeting promoter of HPV 16 E6/E7 and targeting E6, E7 transcript, transduced the CRISPR/Cas9 into cervical HPV-16-positive cell line SiHa. The results showed that CRISPR/Cas9 targeting promoter, as well as targeting E6 and E7 resulted in accumulation of p53 and p21 protein, and consequently remarkably reduced the abilities of proliferation of cervical cancer cells in vitro. Then we inoculated subcutaneously cells into nude mice to establish the transplanted tumor animal models, and found dramatically inhibited tumorigenesis and growth of mice incubated by cells with CRISPR/Cas9 targeting (promoter+E6+E7)-transcript. Our results may provide evidence for application of CRISPR/Cas9 targeting HR-HPV key oncogenes, as a new treatment strategy, in cervical and other HPV-associated cancer therapy.

25042988	Microinjection of clustered regulatory interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9)-related RNA and DNA into fertilized eggs is a novel approach for creating gene-modified mice. Blastocysts obtained just before implantation may be appropriate for testing the fidelity of CRIPSR/Cas9-mediated genome editing because they can be individually handled in vitro and obtained 3days after microinjection, thus allowing researchers to check mutations rapidly. However, it is not known whether indel mutations caused by the CRISPR/Cas9 system can be reproducibly detected in embryos. In this study, we assessed the detection of CRISPR/Cas9-induced mutations in embryos.	T7 endonuclease I was more effective than Surveyor nuclease for detecting mutations in annealed fragments derived from 2 plasmids, which contained nearly identical sequences. Mouse fertilized eggs were microinjected with CRISPR/Cas9-related RNA/DNA to examine whether non-homologous end joining-mediated knockout and homologous recombination-mediated knockin occurred in the endogenous receptor (G protein-coupled) activity modifying protein 2 (Ramp2) gene. Individual blastocysts were lysed to obtain crude DNA solutions, which were used for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. T7 endonuclease I-based PCR and sequencing analysis demonstrated that 25-100% of the embryos were knockout embryos and 7-57% of the embryos were knockin embryos. Our results also established that crude DNA from a single blastocyst was an appropriate template for Whole genome amplification and subsequent assessment by PCR and the T7 endonuclease I-based assay.	The single blastocyst-based assay was useful for determining whether CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing worked in murine embryos.	T Sakurai|S Watanabe|A Kamiyoshi|M Sato|T Shindo
25041533	The bacterium Xenorhabdus nematophila is a mutualist of entomopathogenic Steinernema carpocapsae nematodes and facilitates infection of insect hosts. X. nematophila colonizes the intestine of S. carpocapsae which carries it between insects. In the X. nematophila colonization-defective mutant nilD6::Tn5, the transposon is inserted in a region lacking obvious coding potential. We demonstrate that the transposon disrupts expression of a single CRISPR RNA, NilD RNA. A variant NilD RNA also is expressed by X. nematophila strains from S. anatoliense and S. websteri nematodes. Only nilD from the S. carpocapsae strain of X. nematophila rescued the colonization defect of the nilD6::Tn5 mutant, and this mutant was defective in colonizing all three nematode host species. NilD expression depends on the presence of the associated Cas6e but not Cas3, components of the Type I-E CRISPR-associated machinery. While cas6e deletion in the complemented strain abolished nematode colonization, its disruption in the wild-type parent did not. Likewise, nilD deletion in the parental strain did not impact colonization of the nematode, revealing that the requirement for NilD is evident only in certain genetic backgrounds. Our data demonstrate that NilD RNA is conditionally necessary for mutualistic host colonization and suggest that it functions to regulate endogenous gene expression.

25040500	Manipulation of viral genomes is essential for studying viral gene function and utilizing viruses for therapy. Several techniques for viral genome engineering have been developed. Homologous recombination in virus-infected cells has traditionally been used to edit viral genomes; however, the frequency of the expected recombination is quite low. Alternatively, large viral genomes have been edited using a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) plasmid system. However, cloning of large viral genomes into BAC plasmids is both laborious and time-consuming. In addition, because it is possible for insertion into the viral genome of drug selection markers or parts of BAC plasmids to affect viral function, artificial genes sometimes need to be removed from edited viruses. Herpes simplex virus (HSV), a common DNA virus with a genome length of 152 kbp, causes labialis, genital herpes and encephalitis. Mutant HSV is a candidate for oncotherapy, in which HSV is used to kill tumor cells. In this study, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat-Cas9 system was used to very efficiently engineer HSV without inserting artificial genes into viral genomes. Not only gene-ablated HSV but also gene knock-in HSV were generated using this method. Furthermore, selection with phenotypes of edited genes promotes the isolation efficiencies of expectedly mutated viral clones. Because our method can be applied to other DNA viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegaloviruses, vaccinia virus and baculovirus, our system will be useful for studying various types of viruses, including clinical isolates.

25039742	The type II bacterial CRISPR/Cas [clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas)] system is a very valuable genome engineering tool, which has been widely used in genome editing of a variety of organisms. Previously, we generated floxed alleles in rats by CRISPR/Cas9. Here, we successfully use a two-cut strategy with one circular vector, which contains the exogenous cDNAs with homology arm regions, in generating knockin rats at the Trdmt1, Nestin and Cck loci. The efficiency of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockin was up to 54%. Furthermore, by crossing the Nestin-Cre rat with the Dnmt3b floxed rat and Cck-Cre with the Dnmt1 floxed rat, we detected Cre/loxP-mediated recombination in the F1 generation of rats. We also show that the knockin alleles were germline transmitted. These results provided a simple and flexible engineering strategy for the establishment of knockin rats.

25035423	Gene drives may be capable of addressing ecological problems by altering entire populations of wild organisms, but their use has remained largely theoretical due to technical constraints. Here we consider the potential for RNA-guided gene drives based on the CRISPR nuclease Cas9 to serve as a general method for spreading altered traits through wild populations over many generations. We detail likely capabilities, discuss limitations, and provide novel precautionary strategies to control the spread of gene drives and reverse genomic changes. The ability to edit populations of sexual species would offer substantial benefits to humanity and the environment. For example, RNA-guided gene drives could potentially prevent the spread of disease, support agriculture by reversing pesticide and herbicide resistance in insects and weeds, and control damaging invasive species. However, the possibility of unwanted ecological effects and near-certainty of spread across political borders demand careful assessment of each potential application. We call for thoughtful, inclusive, and well-informed public discussions to explore the responsible use of this currently theoretical technology.	KM Esvelt|AL Smidler|F Catteruccia|GM Church
25027812	Since the establishment of embryonic stem (ES) cell lines, the combined use of gene targeting with homologous recombination has aided in elucidating the functions of various genes. However, the ES cell technique is inefficient and time-consuming. Recently, two new gene-targeting technologies have been developed: the transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) system, and the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein (Cas) system. In addition to aiding researchers in solving conventional problems, these technologies can be used to induce site-specific mutations in various species for which ES cells have not been established. Here, by targeting the Fgf10 gene through RNA microinjection in one-cell mouse embryos with the TALEN and CRISPR/Cas systems, we produced the known limb-defect phenotypes of Fgf10-deficient embryos at the F0 generation. Compared to the TALEN system, the CRISPR/Cas system induced the limb-defect phenotypes with a strikingly higher efficiency. Our results demonstrate that although both gene-targeting technologies are useful, the CRISPR/Cas system more effectively elicits single-step biallelic mutations in mice.

25017160	The transcriptional regulation of endogenous genes with artificial transcription factors (TFs) can offer new tools for plant biotechnology. Three systems are available for mediating site-specific DNA recognition of artificial TFs: those based on zinc fingers, TALEs, and on the CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Artificial TFs require an effector domain that controls the frequency of transcription initiation at endogenous target genes. These effector domains can be transcriptional activators or repressors, but can also have enzymatic activities involved in chromatin remodeling or epigenetic regulation. Artificial TFs are able to regulate gene expression in trans, thus allowing them to evoke dominant mutant phenotypes. Large scale changes in transcriptional activity are induced when the DNA binding domain is deliberately designed to have lower binding specificity. This technique, known as genome interrogation, is a powerful tool for generating novel mutant phenotypes. Genome interrogation has clear mechanistic and practical advantages over activation tagging, which is the technique most closely resembling it. Most notably, genome interrogation can lead to the discovery of mutant phenotypes that are unlikely to be found when using more conventional single gene-based approaches.	N van Tol|BJ van der Zaal
25013902	We report the establishment of an efficient and heritable gene mutagenesis method in the silkworm Bombyx mori using modified type II clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) with an associated protein (Cas9) system. Using four loci Bm-ok, BmKMO, BmTH, and Bmtan as candidates, we proved that genome alterations at specific sites could be induced by direct microinjection of specific guide RNA and Cas9-mRNA into silkworm embryos. Mutation frequencies of 16.7-35.0% were observed in the injected generation, and DNA fragments deletions were also noted. Bm-ok mosaic mutants were used to test for mutant heritability due to the easily determined translucent epidermal phenotype of Bm-ok-disrupted cells. Two crossing strategies were used. In the first, injected Bm-ok moths were crossed with wild-type moths, and a 28.6% frequency of germline mutation transmission was observed. In the second strategy, two Bm-ok mosaic mutant moths were crossed with each other, and 93.6% of the offsprings appeared mutations in both alleles of Bm-ok gene (compound heterozygous). In summary, the CRISPR/Cas9 system can act as a highly specific and heritable gene-editing tool in Bombyx mori.	W Wei|H Xin|B Roy|J Dai|Y Miao|G Gao
25010559	Engineered DNA-binding proteins that can be targeted to specific sites in the genome to manipulate gene expression have enabled many advances in biomedical research. This includes generating tools to study fundamental aspects of gene regulation and the development of a new class of gene therapies that alter the expression of endogenous genes. Designed transcription factors have entered clinical trials for the treatment of human diseases and others are in preclinical development. High-throughput and user-friendly platforms for designing synthetic DNA-binding proteins present innovative methods for deciphering cell biology and designing custom synthetic gene circuits. We review two platforms for designing synthetic transcription factors for manipulating gene expression: Transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) and the RNA-guided clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 system. We present an overview of each technology and a guide for designing and assembling custom TALE- and CRISPR/Cas9-based transcription factors. We also discuss characteristics of each platform that are best suited for different applications.	AM Kabadi|CA Gersbach
25009843	To what extent the genomes of different species belonging to one genus can be diverse and the relationship between genomic differentiation and environmental factor remain unclear for oceanic bacteria. With many new bacterial genera and species being isolated from marine environments, this question warrants attention. In this study, we sequenced all the type strains of the published species of Glaciecola, a recently defined cold-adapted genus with species from diverse marine locations, to study the genomic diversity and cold-adaptation strategy in this genus.The genome size diverged widely from 3.08 to 5.96 Mb, which can be explained by massive gene gain and loss events. Horizontal gene transfer and new gene emergence contributed substantially to the genome size expansion. The genus Glaciecola had an open pan-genome. Comparative genomic research indicated that species of the genus Glaciecola had high diversity in genome size, gene content and genetic relatedness. This may be prevalent in marine bacterial genera considering the dynamic and complex environments of the ocean. Species of Glaciecola had some common genomic features related to cold adaptation, which enable them to thrive and play a role in biogeochemical cycle in the cold marine environments.

25005781	Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked lethal muscle disorder caused by mutations in the Dmd gene encoding Dystrophin. DMD model animals, such as mdx mice and canine X-linked muscular dystrophy dogs, have been widely utilized in the development of a treatment for DMD. Here, we demonstrate the generation of Dmd-mutated rats using a clustered interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas system, an RNA-based genome engineering technique that is also adaptive to rats. We simultaneously targeted two exons in the rat Dmd gene, which resulted in the absence of Dystrophin expression in the F0 generation. Dmd-mutated rats exhibited a decline in muscle strength, and the emergence of degenerative/regenerative phenotypes in the skeletal muscle, heart, and diaphragm. These mutations were heritable by the next generation, and F1 male rats exhibited similar phenotypes in their skeletal muscles. These model rats should prove to be useful for developing therapeutic methods to treat DMD.	K Nakamura|W Fujii|M Tsuboi|J Tanihata|N Teramoto|S Takeuchi|K Naito|K Yamanouchi|M Nishihara

Albeit the enormous potential of these tools, their performance is far from perfect. It is essential to perform a posterior careful analysis of the gene editing experiment. However, there are no computational tools for genome editing assessment yet, and current experimental tools lack sensitivity and flexibility. We present a platform to assess the quality of a genome editing experiment only with three mouse clicks. The method evaluates next-generation data to quantify and characterize insertions, deletions and homologous recombination. CRISPR Genome Analyzer provides a report for the locus selected, which includes a quantification of the edited site and the analysis of the different alterations detected. The platform maps the reads, estimates and locates insertions and deletions, computes the allele replacement efficiency and provides a report integrating all the information.

24990370	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR), in combination with CRISPR associated (cas) genes, constitute CRISPR-Cas bacterial adaptive immune systems. To generate immunity, these systems acquire short sequences of nucleic acids from foreign invaders and incorporate these into their CRISPR arrays as spacers. This adaptation process is the least characterized step in CRISPR-Cas immunity. Here, we used Pectobacterium atrosepticum to investigate adaptation in Type I-F CRISPR-Cas systems. Pre-existing spacers that matched plasmids stimulated hyperactive primed acquisition and resulted in the incorporation of up to nine new spacers across all three native CRISPR arrays. Endogenous expression of the cas genes was sufficient, yet required, for priming. The new spacers inhibited conjugation and transformation, and interference was enhanced with increasing numbers of new spacers. We analyzed ∼ 350 new spacers acquired in priming events and identified a 5'-protospacer-GG-3' protospacer adjacent motif. In contrast to priming in Type I-E systems, new spacers matched either plasmid strand and a biased distribution, including clustering near the primed protospacer, suggested a bi-directional translocation model for the Cas1:Cas2-3 adaptation machinery. Taken together these results indicate priming adaptation occurs in different CRISPR-Cas systems, that it can be highly active in wild-type strains and that the underlying mechanisms vary.

24987113	Technological advancement has opened the door to systematic genetics in mammalian cells. Genome-scale loss-of-function screens can assay fitness defects induced by partial gene knockdown, using RNA interference, or complete gene knockout, using new CRISPR techniques. These screens can reveal the basic blueprint required for cellular proliferation. Moreover, comparing healthy to cancerous tissue can uncover genes that are essential only in the tumor; these genes are targets for the development of specific anticancer therapies. Unfortunately, progress in this field has been hampered by off-target effects of perturbation reagents and poorly quantified error rates in large-scale screens. To improve the quality of information derived from these screens, and to provide a framework for understanding the capabilities and limitations of CRISPR technology, we derive gold-standard reference sets of essential and nonessential genes, and provide a Bayesian classifier of gene essentiality that outperforms current methods on both RNAi and CRISPR screens. Our results indicate that CRISPR technology is more sensitive than RNAi and that both techniques have nontrivial false discovery rates that can be mitigated by rigorous analytical methods.

24987097	Malaria parasites are unicellular organisms residing inside the red blood cells, and current methods for editing the parasite genes have been inefficient. The CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and Cas9 endonuclease-mediated genome editing) system is a new powerful technique for genome editing and has been widely employed to study gene function in various organisms. However, whether this technique can be applied to modify the genomes of malaria parasites has not been determined. In this paper, we demonstrated that Cas9 is able to introduce site-specific DNA double-strand breaks in the Plasmodium yoelii genome that can be repaired through homologous recombination. By supplying engineered homologous repair templates, we generated targeted deletion, reporter knock-in, and nucleotide replacement in multiple parasite genes, achieving up to 100% efficiency in gene deletion and 22 to 45% efficiencies in knock-in and allelic replacement. Our results establish methodologies for introducing desired modifications in the P. yoelii genome with high efficiency and accuracy, which will greatly improve our ability to study gene function of malaria parasites. Importance: Malaria, caused by infection of Plasmodium parasites, remains a world-wide public health burden. Although the genomes of many malaria parasites have been sequenced, we still do not know the functions of approximately half of the genes in the genomes. Studying gene function has become the focus of many studies; however, editing genes in malaria parasite genomes is still inefficient. Here we designed several efficient approaches, based on the CRISPR/Cas9 system, to introduce site-specific DNA double-strand breaks in the Plasmodium yoelii genome that can be repaired through homologous recombination. Using this system, we achieved high efficiencies in gene deletion, reporter tagging, and allelic replacement in multiple parasite genes. This technique for editing the malaria parasite genome will greatly facilitate our ability to elucidate gene function.

24986220	The CRISPR-Cas systems of adaptive antivirus immunity are present in most archaea and many bacteria, and provide resistance to specific viruses or plasmids by inserting fragments of foreign DNA into the host genome and then utilizing transcripts of these spacers to inactivate the cognate foreign genome. The recent development of powerful genome engineering tools on the basis of CRISPR-Cas has sharply increased the interest in the diversity and evolution of these systems. Comparative genomic data indicate that during evolution of prokaryotes CRISPR-Cas loci are lost and acquired via horizontal gene transfer at high rates. Mathematical modeling and initial experimental studies of CRISPR-carrying microbes and viruses reveal complex coevolutionary dynamics.	We performed a bifurcation analysis of models of coevolution of viruses and microbial host that possess CRISPR-Cas hereditary adaptive immunity systems. The analyzed Malthusian and logistic models display complex, and in particular, quasi-chaotic oscillation regimes that have not been previously observed experimentally or in agent-based models of the CRISPR-mediated immunity. The key factors for the appearance of the quasi-chaotic oscillations are the non-linear dependence of the host immunity on the virus load and the partitioning of the hosts into the immune and susceptible populations, so that the system consists of three components.	Bifurcation analysis of CRISPR-host coevolution model predicts complex regimes including quasi-chaotic oscillations. The quasi-chaotic regimes of virus-host coevolution are likely to be biologically relevant given the evolutionary instability of the CRISPR-Cas loci revealed by comparative genomics. The results of this analysis might have implications beyond the CRISPR-Cas systems, i.e. could describe the behavior of any adaptive immunity system with a heritable component, be it genetic or epigenetic. These predictions are experimentally testable.	This manuscript was reviewed by Sandor Pongor, Sergei Maslov and Marek Kimmel. For the complete reports, go to the Reviewers' Reports section.

24981669	Dental plaque is home to a diverse and complex community of bacteria, but has generally been believed to be inhabited by relatively few viruses. We sampled the saliva and dental plaque from 4 healthy human subjects to determine whether plaque was populated by viral communities, and whether there were differences in viral communities specific to subject or sample type.	We found that the plaque was inhabited by a community of bacteriophage whose membership was mostly subject-specific. There was a significant proportion of viral homologues shared between plaque and salivary viromes within each subject, suggesting that some oral viruses were present in both sites. We also characterized Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPRs) in oral streptococci, as their profiles provide clues to the viruses that oral bacteria may be able to counteract. While there were some CRISPR spacers specific to each sample type, many more were shared across sites and were highly subject specific. Many CRISPR spacers matched viruses present in plaque, suggesting that the evolution of CRISPR loci may have been specific to plaque-derived viruses.	Our findings of subject specificity to both plaque-derived viruses and CRISPR profiles suggest that human viral ecology may be highly personalized.

24971596	Toxoplasma gondii is a parasite of humans and animals, and a model for other apicomplexans including Plasmodium spp., the causative agents of malaria. Despite many advances, manipulating the T. gondii genome remains labor intensive, and is often restricted to lab-adapted strains or lines carrying mutations that enable selection. Here, we use the RNA-guided Cas9 nuclease to efficiently generate knockouts without selection, and to introduce point mutations and epitope tags into the T. gondii genome. These methods will streamline the functional analysis of parasite genes and enable high-throughput engineering of their genomes.	SM Sidik|CG Hackett|F Tran|NJ Westwood|S Lourido
24965762	The Aquificales are a diverse group of thermophilic bacteria that thrive in terrestrial and marine hydrothermal environments. They can be divided into the families Aquificaceae, Desulfurobacteriaceae and Hydrogenothermaceae. Although eleven fully sequenced and assembled genomes are available, only little is known about this taxonomic order in terms of RNA metabolism.	In this work, we compare the available genomes, extend their protein annotation, identify regulatory sequences, annotate non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) of known function, predict novel ncRNA candidates, show idiosyncrasies of the genetic decoding machinery, present two different types of transfer-messenger RNAs and variations of the CRISPR systems. Furthermore, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of the Aquificales based on entire genome sequences, and extended this by a classification among all bacteria using 16S rRNA sequences and a set of orthologous proteins.Combining several in silico features (e.g. conserved and stable secondary structures, GC-content, comparison based on multiple genome alignments) with an in vivo dRNA-seq transcriptome analysis of Aquifex aeolicus, we predict roughly 100 novel ncRNA candidates in this bacterium.	We have here re-analyzed the Aquificales, a group of bacteria thriving in extreme environments, sharing the feature of a small, compact genome with a reduced number of protein and ncRNA genes. We present several classical ncRNAs and riboswitch candidates. By combining in silico analysis with dRNA-seq data of A. aeolicus we predict nearly 100 novel ncRNA candidates.

24956386	Although the CRISPR/Cas9/sgRNA system efficiently cleaves intracellular DNA at desired target sites, major concerns remain on potential "off-target" cleavage that may occur throughout the whole genome. In order to improve CRISPR-Cas9 specificity for targeted genome editing and transcriptional control, we describe a bioinformatics tool "sgRNAcas9", which is a software package developed for fast design of CRISPR sgRNA with minimized off-target effects. This package consists of programs to perform a search for CRISPR target sites (protospacers) with user-defined parameters, predict genome-wide Cas9 potential off-target cleavage sites (POT), classify the POT into three categories, batch-design oligonucleotides for constructing 20-nt (nucleotides) or truncated sgRNA expression vectors, extract desired length nucleotide sequences flanking the on- or off-target cleavage sites for designing PCR primer pairs to validate the mutations by T7E1 cleavage assay. Importantly, by identifying potential off-target sites in silico, the sgRNAcas9 allows the selection of more specific target sites and aids the identification of bona fide off-target sites, significantly facilitating the design of sgRNA for genome editing applications. sgRNAcas9 software package is publicly available at BiooTools website (www.biootools.com) under the terms of the GNU General Public License.

24956376	CRISPR/Cas9-mediated DNA cleavage (CCMDC) is becoming increasingly used for efficient genome engineering. Proto-spacer adjacent motif (PAM) adjacent to target sequence is one of the key components in the design of CCMDC strategies. It has been reported that NAG sequences are the predominant non-canonical PAM for CCMDC at the human EMX locus, but it is not clear whether it is universal at other loci. In the present study, we attempted to use a GFP-reporter system to comprehensively and quantitatively test the efficiency of CCMDC with non-canonical PAMs in human cells. The initial results indicated that the effectiveness of NGA PAM for CCMDC is much higher than that of other 14 PAMs including NAG. Then we further designed another three pairs of NGG, NGA and NAG PAMs at different locations in the GFP gene and investigated the corresponding DNA cleavage efficiency. We observed that one group of NGA PAMs have a relatively higher DNA cleavage efficiency, while the other groups have lower efficiency, compared with the corresponding NAG PAMs. Our study clearly demonstrates that NAG may not be the universally predominant non-canonical PAM for CCMDC in human cells. These findings raise more concerns over off-target effects in CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome engineering.	Y Zhang|X Ge|F Yang|L Zhang|J Zheng|X Tan|ZB Jin|J Qu|F Gu
24954249	CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing is a next-generation strategy for genetic modifications, not only for single gene targeting, but also for multiple targeted mutagenesis. To make the most of the multiplexity of CRISPR/Cas9, we established a system for constructing all-in-one expression vectors containing multiple guide RNA expression cassettes and a Cas9 nuclease/nickase expression cassette. We further demonstrated successful examples of multiple targeting including chromosomal deletions in human cells using the all-in-one CRISPR/Cas9 vectors constructed with our novel system. Our system provides an efficient targeting strategy for multiplex genome/epigenome editing, simultaneous activation/repression of multiple genes, and beyond.

24953798	Introducing a point mutation is a fundamental method used to demonstrate the roles of particular nucleotides or amino acids in the genetic elements or proteins, and is widely used in in vitro experiments based on cultured cells and exogenously provided DNA. However, the in vivo application of this approach by modifying genomic loci is uncommon, partly due to its technical and temporal demands. This leaves many in vitro findings un-validated under in vivo conditions. We herein applied the CRISPR/Cas9 system to generate mice with point mutations in their genomes, which led to single amino acid substitutions in proteins of interest. By microinjecting gRNA, hCas9 mRNA and single-stranded donor oligonucleotides (ssODN) into mouse zygotes, we introduced defined genomic modifications in their genome with a low cost and in a short time. Both single gRNA/WT hCas9 and double nicking set-ups were effective. We also found that the distance between the modification site and gRNA target site was a significant parameter affecting the efficiency of the substitution. We believe that this is a powerful technique that can be used to examine the relevance of in vitro findings, as well as the mutations found in patients with genetic disorders, in an in vivo system.

24952903	Genome sequencing studies have shown that human malignancies often bear mutations in four or more driver genes, but it is difficult to recapitulate this degree of genetic complexity in mouse models using conventional breeding. Here we use the CRISPR-Cas9 system of genome editing to overcome this limitation. By delivering combinations of small guide RNAs (sgRNAs) and Cas9 with a lentiviral vector, we modified up to five genes in a single mouse hematopoietic stem cell (HSC), leading to clonal outgrowth and myeloid malignancy. We thereby generated models of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with cooperating mutations in genes encoding epigenetic modifiers, transcription factors and mediators of cytokine signaling, recapitulating the combinations of mutations observed in patients. Our results suggest that lentivirus-delivered sgRNA:Cas9 genome editing should be useful to engineer a broad array of in vivo cancer models that better reflect the complexity of human disease.

24940621	The genus Sulfobacillus is a cohort of mildly thermophilic or thermotolerant acidophiles within the phylum Firmicutes and requires extremely acidic environments and hypersalinity for optimal growth. However, our understanding of them is still preliminary partly because few genome sequences are available. Here, the draft genome of Sulfobacillus thermosulfidooxidans strain ST was deciphered to obtain a comprehensive insight into the genetic content and to understand the cellular mechanisms necessary for its survival. Furthermore, the expressions of key genes related with iron and sulfur oxidation were verified by semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis. The draft genome sequence of Sulfobacillus thermosulfidooxidans strain ST, which encodes 3225 predicted coding genes on a total length of 3,333,554 bp and a 48.35% G+C, revealed the high degree of heterogeneity with other Sulfobacillus species. The presence of numerous transposases, genomic islands and complete CRISPR/Cas defence systems testifies to its dynamic evolution consistent with the genome heterogeneity. As expected, S. thermosulfidooxidans encodes a suit of conserved enzymes required for the oxidation of inorganic sulfur compounds (ISCs). The model of sulfur oxidation in S. thermosulfidooxidans was proposed, which showed some different characteristics from the sulfur oxidation of Gram-negative A. ferrooxidans. Sulfur oxygenase reductase and heterodisulfide reductase were suggested to play important roles in the sulfur oxidation. Although the iron oxidation ability was observed, some key proteins cannot be identified in S. thermosulfidooxidans. Unexpectedly, a predicted sulfocyanin is proposed to transfer electrons in the iron oxidation. Furthermore, its carbon metabolism is rather flexible, can perform the transformation of pentose through the oxidative and non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathways and has the ability to take up small organic compounds. It encodes a multitude of heavy metal resistance systems to adapt the heavy metal-containing environments.	X Guo|H Yin|Y Liang|Q Hu|X Zhou|Y Xiao|L Ma|X Zhang|G Qiu|X Liu
24936832	Humanized mouse models have become increasingly important and widely used in modeling human diseases in biomedical research. Immunodeficient mice such as NOD-Rag1-/-IL2RgammaC-null (NRG) or NOD-SCID-IL2RgammaC-null (NSG) mice are critical for efficient engraftment of human cells or tissues. However, their genetic modification remains challenging due to a lack of embryonic stem cells and difficulty in the collection of timed embryos after superovulation. Here, we report the generation of gene knockout NRG mice by combining in vitro fertilization (IVF) and CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Sufficient numbers of fertilized embryos were produced through IVF, and a high rate of Fah gene targeting was achieved with microinjection of Cas9 mRNA, gRNA and single strand oligonucleotide DNA (ssDNA) into the embryos. The technology paves the way to construct NRG or NSG mutant mice to facilitate new humanized mouse models. The technology can also be readily adapted to introduce mutations in other species such as swine and non-human primates.	F Li|DO Cowley|D Banner|E Holle|L Zhang|L Su
24931489	Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) offer a unique platform for elucidating the genes and molecular pathways that underlie complex traits and diseases. To realize this promise, methods for rapid and controllable genetic manipulations are urgently needed. By combining two newly developed gene-editing tools, the TALEN and CRISPR/Cas systems, we have developed a genome-engineering platform in hPSCs, which we named iCRISPR. iCRISPR enabled rapid and highly efficient generation of biallelic knockout hPSCs for loss-of-function studies, as well as homozygous knockin hPSCs with specific nucleotide alterations for precise modeling of disease conditions. We further demonstrate efficient one-step generation of double- and triple-gene knockout hPSC lines, as well as stage-specific inducible gene knockout during hPSC differentiation. Thus the iCRISPR platform is uniquely suited for dissection of complex genetic interactions and pleiotropic gene functions in human disease studies and has the potential to support high-throughput genetic analysis in hPSCs.

24929529	Identification and validation of drug-resistant mutations can provide important insights into the mechanism of action of a compound. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of such an approach in mammalian cells using next-generation sequencing of drug-resistant clones and CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene editing on two drug-target pairs, 6-thioguanine-HPRT1 and triptolide-ERCC3. We showed that disrupting functional HPRT1 allele or introducing ERCC3 point mutations by gene editing can confer drug resistance in cells.	Y Smurnyy|M Cai|H Wu|E McWhinnie|JA Tallarico|Y Yang|Y Feng
24929528	To identify physiological targets of drugs and bioactive small molecules, we developed an approach, named DrugTargetSeqR, which combines high-throughput sequencing, computational mutation discovery and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9-based genome editing. We applied this approach to ispinesib and YM155, drugs that have undergone clinical trials as anticancer agents, and uncovered mechanisms of action and identified genetic and epigenetic mechanisms likely to cause drug resistance in human cancer cells.

24927590	Individuals homozygous for the C-C chemokine receptor type 5 gene with 32-bp deletions (CCR5Δ32) are resistant to HIV-1 infection. In this study, we generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) homozygous for the naturally occurring CCR5Δ32 mutation through genome editing of wild-type iPSCs using a combination of transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) or RNA-guided clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 together with the piggyBac technology. Remarkably, TALENs or CRISPR-Cas9-mediated double-strand DNA breaks resulted in up to 100% targeting of the colonies on one allele of which biallelic targeting occurred at an average of 14% with TALENs and 33% with CRISPR. Excision of the piggyBac using transposase seamlessly reproduced exactly the naturally occurring CCR5Δ32 mutation without detectable exogenous sequences. We differentiated these modified iPSCs into monocytes/macrophages and demonstrated their resistance to HIV-1 challenge. We propose that this strategy may provide an approach toward a functional cure of HIV-1 infection.	L Ye|J Wang|AI Beyer|F Teque|TJ Cradick|Z Qi|JC Chang|G Bao|MO Muench|J Yu|JA Levy|YW Kan
24923884	Due to excessive antibiotic use, drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis has become a serious public health threat and a major obstacle to disease control in many countries. To better understand the evolution of drug-resistant M. tuberculosis strains, we performed whole genome sequencing for 7 M. tuberculosis clinical isolates with different antibiotic resistance profiles and conducted comparative genomic analysis of gene variations among them.	We observed that all 7 M. tuberculosis clinical isolates with different levels of drug resistance harbored similar numbers of SNPs, ranging from 1409-1464. The numbers of insertion/deletions (Indels) identified in the 7 isolates were also similar, ranging from 56 to 101. A total of 39 types of mutations were identified in drug resistance-associated loci, including 14 previously reported ones and 25 newly identified ones. Sixteen of the identified large Indels spanned PE-PPE-PGRS genes, which represents a major source of antigenic variability. Aside from SNPs and Indels, a CRISPR locus with varied spacers was observed in all 7 clinical isolates, suggesting that they might play an important role in plasticity of the M. tuberculosis genome. The nucleotide diversity (Л value) and selection intensity (dN/dS value) of the whole genome sequences of the 7 isolates were similar. The dN/dS values were less than 1 for all 7 isolates (range from 0.608885 to 0.637365), supporting the notion that M. tuberculosis genomes undergo purifying selection. The Л values and dN/dS values were comparable between drug-susceptible and drug-resistant strains.	In this study, we show that clinical M. tuberculosis isolates exhibit distinct variations in terms of the distribution of SNP, Indels, CRISPR-cas locus, as well as the nucleotide diversity and selection intensity, but there are no generalizable differences between drug-susceptible and drug-resistant isolates on the genomic scale. Our study provides evidence strengthening the notion that the evolution of drug resistance among clinical M. tuberculosis isolates is clearly a complex and diversified process.

24920831	The adaptation against foreign nucleic acids by the CRISPR-Cas system (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats and CRISPR-associated proteins) depends on the insertion of foreign nucleic acid-derived sequences into the CRISPR array as novel spacers by still unknown mechanism. We identified and characterized in Escherichia coli intermediate states of spacer integration and mapped the integration site at the chromosomal CRISPR array in vivo. The results show that the insertion of new spacers occurs by site-specific nicking at both strands of the leader proximal repeat in a staggered way and is accompanied by joining of the resulting 5'-ends of the repeat strands with the 3'-ends of the incoming spacer. This concerted cleavage-ligation reaction depends on the metal-binding center of Cas1 protein and requires the presence of Cas2. By acquisition assays using plasmid-located CRISPR array with mutated repeat sequences, we demonstrate that the primary sequence of the first repeat is crucial for cleavage of the CRISPR array and the ligation of new spacer DNA.

24918588	The newly developed CRISPR/Cas9 system for targeted gene knockout or editing has recently been shown to function in plants in both transient expression systems as well as in primary T1 transgenic plants. However, stable transmission of genes modified by the Cas9/single guide RNA (sgRNA) system to the T2 generation and beyond has not been demonstrated. Here we provide extensive data demonstrating the efficiency of Cas9/sgRNA in causing modification of a chromosomally integrated target reporter gene during early development of transgenic Arabidopsis plants and inheritance of the modified gene in T2 and T3 progeny. Efficient conversion of a nonfunctional, out-of-frame GFP gene to a functional GFP gene was confirmed in T1 plants by the observation of green fluorescent signals in leaf tissues as well as the presence of mutagenized DNA sequences at the sgRNA target site within the GFP gene. All GFP-positive T1 transgenic plants and nearly all GFP-negative plants examined contained mutagenized GFP genes. Analyses of 42 individual T2 generation plants derived from 6 different T1 progenitor plants showed that 50% of T2 plants inherited a single T-DNA insert. The efficiency of the Cas9/sgRNA system and stable inheritance of edited genes point to the promise of this system for facile editing of plant genes.	W Jiang|B Yang|DP Weeks

24917359	New technologies have recently been developed to control the expression of human genes in their native genomic context by engineering synthetic transcription factors that can be targeted to any DNA sequence. The ability to precisely regulate any gene as it occurs naturally in the genome provides a means to address a variety of diseases and disorders. This approach also circumvents some of the traditional challenges of gene therapy. In this editorial, we review the technologies that have enabled targeted human gene activation, including the engineering of transcription factors based on zinc finger proteins, transcription activator-like effectors and the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Additionally, we highlight examples in which these methods have been developed for therapeutic applications and discuss challenges and opportunities.	CA Gersbach|P Perez-Pinera
24916110	Individuals with naturally occurring loss-of-function proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) mutations experience reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and protection against cardiovascular disease.	The goal of this study was to assess whether genome editing using a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated system can efficiently introduce loss-of-function mutations into the endogenous PCSK9 gene in vivo.	We used adenovirus to express CRISPR-associated 9 and a CRISPR guide RNA targeting Pcsk9 in mouse liver, where the gene is specifically expressed. We found that <3 to 4 days of administration of the virus, the mutagenesis rate of Pcsk9 in the liver was as high as >50%. This resulted in decreased plasma PCSK9 levels, increased hepatic low-density lipoprotein receptor levels, and decreased plasma cholesterol levels (by 35-40%). No off-target mutagenesis was detected in 10 selected sites.	Genome editing with the CRISPR-CRISPR-associated 9 system disrupts the Pcsk9 gene in vivo with high efficiency and reduces blood cholesterol levels in mice. This approach may have therapeutic potential for the prevention of cardiovascular disease in humans.	Q Ding|A Strong|KM Patel|SL Ng|BS Gosis|SN Regan|CA Cowan|DJ Rader|K Musunuru
24909109	Bacteria and archaea have evolved sophisticated adaptive immune systems, known as CRISPR-Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-CRISPR-associated proteins) systems, which target and inactivate invading viruses and plasmids. Immunity is acquired by integrating short fragments of foreign DNA into CRISPR loci, and following transcription and processing of these loci, the CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) guide the Cas proteins to complementary invading nucleic acid, which results in target interference. In this Review, we summarize the recent structural and biochemical insights that have been gained for the three major types of CRISPR-Cas systems, which together provide a detailed molecular understanding of the unique and conserved mechanisms of RNA-guided adaptive immunity in bacteria and archaea.

24903519	Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPRs) are utilized by bacteria to resist encounters with their viruses. Human body surfaces have numerous bacteria that harbor CRISPRs, and their content can provide clues as to the types and features of viruses they may have encountered.	We investigated the conservation of CRISPR content from streptococci on skin and saliva of human subjects over 8-weeks to determine whether similarities existed in the CRISPR spacer profiles and whether CRISPR spacers were a stable component of each biogeographic site. Most of the CRISPR sequences identified were unique, but a small proportion of spacers from the skin and saliva of each subject matched spacers derived from previously sequenced loci of S. thermophilus and other streptococci. There were significant proportions of CRISPR spacers conserved over the entire 8-week study period for all subjects, and salivary CRISPR spacers sampled in the mornings showed significantly higher levels of conservation than any other time of day. We also found substantial similarities in the spacer repertoires of the skin and saliva of each subject. Many skin-derived spacers matched salivary viruses, supporting that bacteria of the skin may encounter viruses with similar sequences to those found in the mouth. Despite the similarities between skin and salivary spacer repertoires, the variation present was distinct based on each subject and body site.	The conservation of CRISPR spacers in the saliva and the skin of human subjects over the time period studied suggests a relative conservation of the bacteria harboring them.

24899040	A clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) typing method has recently been developed and used for typing and subtyping of Salmonella spp., but it is complicated and labor intensive because it has to analyze all spacers in two CRISPR loci. Here, we developed a more convenient and efficient method, namely, CRISPR locus spacer pair typing (CLSPT), which only needs to analyze the two newly incorporated spacers adjoining the leader array in the two CRISPR loci. We analyzed a CRISPR array of 82 strains belonging to 21 Salmonella serovars isolated from humans in different areas of China by using this new method. We also retrieved the newly incorporated spacers in each CRISPR locus of 537 Salmonella isolates which have definite serotypes in the Pasteur Institute's CRISPR Database to evaluate this method. Our findings showed that this new CLSPT method presents a high level of consistency (kappa = 0.9872, Matthew's correlation coefficient = 0.9712) with the results of traditional serotyping, and thus, it can also be used to predict serotypes of Salmonella spp. Moreover, this new method has a considerable discriminatory power (discriminatory index [DI] = 0.8145), comparable to those of multilocus sequence typing (DI = 0.8088) and conventional CRISPR typing (DI = 0.8684). Because CLSPT only costs about $5 to $10 per isolate, it is a much cheaper and more attractive method for subtyping of Salmonella isolates. In conclusion, this new method will provide considerable advantages over other molecular subtyping methods, and it may become a valuable epidemiologic tool for the surveillance of Salmonella infections.

24896221	While the first version of the Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) has been adopted by several academic and commercial genetic design automation (GDA) software tools, it only covers a limited number of the requirements for a standardized exchange format for synthetic biology. In particular, SBOL Version 1.1 is capable of representing DNA components and their hierarchical composition via sequence annotations. This proposal revises SBOL Version 1.1, enabling the representation of a wider range of components with and without sequences, including RNA components, protein components, small molecules, and molecular complexes. It also introduces modules to instantiate groups of components on the basis of their shared function and assert molecular interactions between components. By increasing the range of structural and functional descriptions in SBOL and allowing for their composition, the proposed improvements enable SBOL to represent and facilitate the exchange of a broader class of genetic designs.

24886988	Bacteria rely on two known DNA-level defenses against their bacteriophage predators: restriction-modification and Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated (Cas) systems. Certain phages have evolved countermeasures that are known to block endonucleases. For example, phage T4 not only adds hydroxymethyl groups to all of its cytosines, but also glucosylates them, a strategy that defeats almost all restriction enzymes. We sought to determine whether these DNA modifications can similarly impede CRISPR-based defenses. In a bioinformatics search, we found naturally occurring CRISPR spacers that potentially target phages known to modify their DNA. Experimentally, we show that the Cas9 nuclease from the Type II CRISPR system of Streptococcus pyogenes can overcome a variety of DNA modifications in Escherichia coli. The levels of Cas9-mediated phage resistance to bacteriophage T4 and the mutant phage T4 gt, which contains hydroxymethylated but not glucosylated cytosines, were comparable to phages with unmodified cytosines, T7 and the T4-like phage RB49. Our results demonstrate that Cas9 is not impeded by N6-methyladenine, 5-methylcytosine, 5-hydroxymethylated cytosine, or glucosylated 5-hydroxymethylated cytosine.	SJ Yaung|KM Esvelt|GM Church
24885207	Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Virchow has been recognized as a significant health burden in Asia, Australia and Europe. In addition to its global distribution, S. Virchow is clinically significant due to the frequency at which it causes invasive infections and its association with outbreaks arising from food-borne transmission. Here, we examine the genome of an invasive isolate of S. Virchow SVQ1 (phage type 8) from an outbreak in southeast Queensland, Australia. In addition to identifying new potential genotyping targets that could be used for discriminating between S. Virchow strains in outbreak scenarios, we also aimed to carry out a comprehensive comparative analysis of the S. Virchow genomes.	Genome comparisons between S. Virchow SVQ1 and S. Virchow SL491, a previously published strain, identified a high degree of genomic similarity between the two strains with fewer than 200 single nucleotide differences. Clustered Regularly Interspaced Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) regions were identified as a highly variable region that could be used to discriminate between S. Virchow isolates. We amplified and sequenced the CRISPR regions of fifteen S. Virchow isolates collected from seven different outbreaks across Australia. We observed three allelic types of the CRISPR region from these isolates based on the presence/absence of the spacers and were able to discriminate S. Virchow phage type 8 isolates originating from different outbreaks. A comparison with 27 published Salmonella genomes found that the S. Virchow SVQ1 genome encodes 11 previously described Salmonella Pathogenicity Islands (SPI), as well as additional genomic islands including a remnant integrative conjugative element that is distinct from SPI-7. In addition, the S. Virchow genome possesses a novel prophage that encodes the Type III secretion system effector protein SopE, a key Salmonella virulence factor. The prophage shares very little similarity to the SopE prophages found in other Salmonella serovars suggesting an independent acquisition of sopE.	The availability of this genome will serve as a genome template and facilitate further studies on understanding the virulence and global distribution of the S. Virchow serovar, as well as the development of genotyping methods for outbreak investigations.	NL Bachmann|NK Petty|NL Ben Zakour|JM Szubert|J Savill|SA Beatson
24880488	Genome manipulation in the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum remains largely intractable and improved genomic tools are needed to further understand pathogenesis and drug resistance. We demonstrated the CRISPR-Cas9 system for use in P. falciparum by disrupting chromosomal loci and generating marker-free, single-nucleotide substitutions with high efficiency. Additionally, an artemisinin-resistant strain was generated by introducing a previously implicated polymorphism, thus illustrating the value of efficient genome editing in malaria research.

24879462	Genome editing based on CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-associated nuclease (Cas9) has been successfully applied in dozens of diverse plant and animal species, including the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The rapid life cycle and easy access to the ovary by micro-injection make C. elegans an ideal organism both for applying CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technology and for optimizing genome-editing protocols. Here we report efficient and straightforward CRISPR-Cas9 genome-editing methods for C. elegans, including a Co-CRISPR strategy that facilitates detection of genome-editing events. We describe methods for detecting homologous recombination (HR) events, including direct screening methods as well as new selection/counterselection strategies. Our findings reveal a surprisingly high frequency of HR-mediated gene conversion, making it possible to rapidly and precisely edit the C. elegans genome both with and without the use of co-inserted marker genes.

24878568	The water flea Daphnia magna has been used as an animal model in ecology, evolution, and environmental sciences. Thanks to the recent progress in Daphnia genomics, genetic information such as the draft genome sequence and expressed sequence tags (ESTs) is now available. To investigate the relationship between phenotypes and the available genetic information about Daphnia, some gene manipulation methods have been developed. However, a technique to induce targeted mutagenesis into Daphnia genome remains elusive. To overcome this problem, we focused on an emerging genome editing technique mediated by the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated (CRISPR/Cas) system to introduce genomic mutations. In this study, we targeted a functionally conserved regulator of eye development, the eyeless gene in D. magna. When we injected Cas9 mRNAs and eyeless-targeting guide RNAs into eggs, 18-47% of the survived juveniles exhibited abnormal eye morphology. After maturation, up to 8.2% of the adults produced progenies with deformed eyes, which carried mutations in the eyeless loci. These results showed that CRISPR/Cas system could introduce heritable mutations into the endogenous eyeless gene in D. magna. This is the first report of a targeted gene knockout technique in Daphnia and will be useful in uncovering Daphnia gene functions.	T Nakanishi|Y Kato|T Matsuura|H Watanabe
24875628	We report a method for generating Drosophila germline mutants effectively via injection of the complex of the purified Cas9 protein, tracrRNA, and gene-specific crRNAs, which may reduce delayed mutations because of the transient activity of the Cas9 protein, combined with the simple mutation detection in GO founders by the T7E1 assay.

24868032	Agrobacterium rhizogenes (or Rhizobium rhizogenes) is able to transform plant genomes and induce the production of hairy roots. We describe the use of A. rhizogenes in tomato (Solanum spp.) to rapidly assess gene expression and function. Gene expression of reporters is indistinguishable in plants transformed by Agrobacterium tumefaciens as compared with A. rhizogenes. A root cell type- and tissue-specific promoter resource has been generated for domesticated and wild tomato (Solanum lycopersicum and Solanum pennellii, respectively) using these approaches. Imaging of tomato roots using A. rhizogenes coupled with laser scanning confocal microscopy is facilitated by the use of a membrane-tagged protein fused to a red fluorescent protein marker present in binary vectors. Tomato-optimized isolation of nuclei tagged in specific cell types and translating ribosome affinity purification binary vectors were generated and used to monitor associated messenger RNA abundance or chromatin modification. Finally, transcriptional reporters, translational reporters, and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-associated nuclease9 genome editing demonstrate that SHORT-ROOT and SCARECROW gene function is conserved between Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and tomato.

24860161	A number of technologies, including CRISPR/Cas, transcription activator-like effector nucleases and zinc-finger nucleases, allow the user to target a chosen locus for genome editing or regulatory interference. Specificity, however, is a major problem, and the targeted locus must be chosen with care to avoid inadvertently affecting other loci ('off-targets') in the genome. To address this we have created 'Genome Target Scan' (GT-Scan), a flexible web-based tool that ranks all potential targets in a user-selected region of a genome in terms of how many off-targets they have. GT-Scan gives the user flexibility to define the desired characteristics of targets and off-targets via a simple 'target rule', and its interactive output allows detailed inspection of each of the most promising candidate targets. GT-Scan can be used to identify optimal targets for CRISPR/Cas systems, but its flexibility gives it potential to be adapted to other genome-targeting technologies as well.	GT-Scan can be run via the web at: http://gt-scan.braembl.org.au.	A O'Brien|TL Bailey
24836556	Engineered nucleases can be used to induce site-specific double-strand breaks (DSBs) in plant genomes. Thus, homologous recombination (HR) can be enhanced and targeted mutagenesis can be achieved by error-prone non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). Recently, the bacterial CRISPR/Cas9 system was used for DSB induction in plants to promote HR and NHEJ. Cas9 can also be engineered to work as a nickase inducing single-strand breaks (SSBs). Here we show that only the nuclease but not the nickase is an efficient tool for NHEJ-mediated mutagenesis in plants. We demonstrate the stable inheritance of nuclease-induced targeted mutagenesis events in the ADH1 and TT4 genes of Arabidopsis thaliana at frequencies from 2.5 up to 70.0%. Deep sequencing analysis revealed NHEJ-mediated DSB repair in about a third of all reads in T1 plants. In contrast, applying the nickase resulted in the reduction of mutation frequency by at least 740-fold. Nevertheless, the nickase is able to induce HR at similar efficiencies as the nuclease or the homing endonuclease I-SceI. Two different types of somatic HR mechanisms, recombination between tandemly arranged direct repeats as well as gene conversion using the information on an inverted repeat could be enhanced by the nickase to a similar extent as by DSB-inducing enzymes. Thus, the Cas9 nickase has the potential to become an important tool for genome engineering in plants. It should not only be applicable for HR-mediated gene targeting systems but also by the combined action of two nickases as DSB-inducing agents excluding off-target effects in homologous genomic regions.

24827782	Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are widely used in the biopharmaceutical industry as a host for the production of complex pharmaceutical proteins. Thus genome engineering of CHO cells for improved product quality and yield is of great interest. Here, we demonstrate for the first time the efficacy of the CRISPR Cas9 technology in CHO cells by generating site-specific gene disruptions in COSMC and FUT8, both of which encode proteins involved in glycosylation. The tested single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) created an indel frequency up to 47.3% in COSMC, while an indel frequency up to 99.7% in FUT8 was achieved by applying lectin selection. All eight sgRNAs examined in this study resulted in relatively high indel frequencies, demonstrating that the Cas9 system is a robust and efficient genome-editing methodology in CHO cells. Deep sequencing revealed that 85% of the indels created by Cas9 resulted in frameshift mutations at the target sites, with a strong preference for single base indels. Finally, we have developed a user-friendly bioinformatics tool, named "CRISPy" for rapid identification of sgRNA target sequences in the CHO-K1 genome. The CRISPy tool identified 1,970,449 CRISPR targets divided into 27,553 genes and lists the number of off-target sites in the genome. In conclusion, the proven functionality of Cas9 to edit CHO genomes combined with our CRISPy database have the potential to accelerate genome editing and synthetic biology efforts in CHO cells.

24825012	Toxoplasma gondii has become a model for studying the phylum Apicomplexa, in part due to the availability of excellent genetic tools. Although reverse genetic tools are available in a few widely utilized laboratory strains, they rely on special genetic backgrounds that are not easily implemented in natural isolates. Recent progress in modifying CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats), a system of DNA recognition used as a defense mechanism in bacteria and archaea, has led to extremely efficient gene disruption in a variety of organisms. Here we utilized a CRISPR/CAS9-based system with single guide RNAs to disrupt genes in T. gondii. CRISPR/CAS9 provided an extremely efficient system for targeted gene disruption and for site-specific insertion of selectable markers through homologous recombination. CRISPR/CAS9 also facilitated site-specific insertion in the absence of homology, thus increasing the utility of this approach over existing technology. We then tested whether CRISPR/CAS9 would enable efficient transformation of a natural isolate. Using CRISPR/CAS9, we were able to rapidly generate both rop18 knockouts and complemented lines in the type I GT1 strain, which has been used for forward genetic crosses but which remains refractory to reverse genetic approaches. Assessment of their phenotypes in vivo revealed that ROP18 contributed a greater proportion to acute pathogenesis in GT1 than in the laboratory type I RH strain. Thus, CRISPR/CAS9 extends reverse genetic techniques to diverse isolates of T. gondii, allowing exploration of a much wider spectrum of biological diversity.	Genetic approaches have proven very powerful for studying the biology of organisms, including microbes. However, ease of genetic manipulation varies widely among isolates, with common lab isolates often being the most amenable to such approaches. Unfortunately, such common lab isolates have also been passaged frequently in vitro and have thus lost many of the attributes of wild isolates, often affecting important traits, like virulence. On the other hand, wild isolates are often not amenable to standard genetic approaches, thus limiting inquiry about the genetic basis of biological diversity. Here we imported a new genetic system based on CRISPR/CAS9, which allows high efficiency of targeted gene disruption in natural isolates of T. gondii. This advance promises to bring the power of genetics to bear on the broad diversity of T. gondii strains that have been described recently.	B Shen|KM Brown|TD Lee|LD Sibley

24807418	Misfolded ER proteins are retrotranslocated into the cytosol for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. The human cytomegalovirus protein US11 exploits this ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) pathway to downregulate HLA class I molecules in virus-infected cells, thereby evading elimination by cytotoxic T-lymphocytes. US11-mediated degradation of HLA class I has been instrumental in the identification of key components of mammalian ERAD, including Derlin-1, p97, VIMP and SEL1L. Despite this, the process governing retrotranslocation of the substrate is still poorly understood. Here using a high-coverage genome-wide shRNA library, we identify the uncharacterized protein TMEM129 and the ubiquitin-conjugating E2 enzyme UBE2J2 to be essential for US11-mediated HLA class I downregulation. TMEM129 is an unconventional C4C4-type RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase that resides within a complex containing various other ERAD components, including Derlin-1, Derlin-2, VIMP and p97, indicating that TMEM129 is an integral part of the ER-resident dislocation complex mediating US11-induced HLA class I degradation.

24803673	The prokaryotic immune system CRISPR/Cas (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats/CRISPR-associated genes) adapts to foreign invaders by acquiring their short deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) fragments as spacers, which guide subsequent interference to foreign nucleic acids based on sequence matching. The adaptation mechanism avoiding acquiring 'self' DNA fragments is poorly understood. In Haloarcula hispanica, we previously showed that CRISPR adaptation requires being primed by a pre-existing spacer partially matching the invader DNA. Here, we further demonstrate that flanking a fully-matched target sequence, a functional PAM (protospacer adjacent motif) is still required to prime adaptation. Interestingly, interference utilizes only four PAM sequences, whereas adaptation-priming tolerates as many as 23 PAM sequences. This relaxed PAM selectivity explains how adaptation-priming maximizes its tolerance of PAM mutations (that escape interference) while avoiding mis-targeting the spacer DNA within CRISPR locus. We propose that the primed adaptation, which hitches and cooperates with the interference pathway, distinguishes target from non-target by CRISPR ribonucleic acid guidance and PAM recognition.

24797424	A key obstacle to creating sophisticated genetic circuits has been the lack of scalable device libraries. Here we present a modular transcriptional repression architecture based on clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats (CRISPR) system and examine approaches for regulated expression of guide RNAs in human cells. Subsequently we demonstrate that CRISPR regulatory devices can be layered to create functional cascaded circuits, which provide a valuable toolbox for engineering purposes.

24794707	Recurring deletions of chromosome 7 and 7q [-7/del(7q)] occur in myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and are associated with poor prognosis. However, the identity of functionally relevant tumor suppressors on 7q remains unclear. Using RNAi and CRISPR/Cas9 approaches, we show that an ∼50% reduction in gene dosage of the mixed lineage leukemia 3 (MLL3) gene, located on 7q36.1, cooperates with other events occurring in -7/del(7q) AMLs to promote leukemogenesis. Mll3 suppression impairs the differentiation of HSPC. Interestingly, Mll3-suppressed leukemias, like human -7/del(7q) AMLs, are refractory to conventional chemotherapy but sensitive to the BET inhibitor JQ1. Thus, our mouse model functionally validates MLL3 as a haploinsufficient 7q tumor suppressor and suggests a therapeutic option for this aggressive disease.

24793649	The initial stage of CRISPR-Cas immunity involves the integration of foreign DNA spacer segments into the host genomic CRISPR locus. The nucleases Cas1 and Cas2 are the only proteins conserved among all CRISPR-Cas systems, yet the molecular functions of these proteins during immunity are unknown. Here we show that Cas1 and Cas2 from Escherichia coli form a stable complex that is essential for spacer acquisition and determine the 2.3-Å-resolution crystal structure of the Cas1-Cas2 complex. Mutations that perturb Cas1-Cas2 complex formation disrupt CRISPR DNA recognition and spacer acquisition in vivo. Active site mutants of Cas2, unlike those of Cas1, can still acquire new spacers, thus indicating a nonenzymatic role of Cas2 during immunity. These results reveal the universal roles of Cas1 and Cas2 and suggest a mechanism by which Cas1-Cas2 complexes specify sites of CRISPR spacer integration.

24781324	Cells navigate environments, communicate and build complex patterns by initiating gene expression in response to specific signals. Engineers seek to harness this capability to program cells to perform tasks or create chemicals and materials that match the complexity seen in nature. This Review describes new tools that aid the construction of genetic circuits. Circuit dynamics can be influenced by the choice of regulators and changed with expression 'tuning knobs'. We collate the failure modes encountered when assembling circuits, quantify their impact on performance and review mitigation efforts. Finally, we discuss the constraints that arise from circuits having to operate within a living cell. Collectively, better tools, well-characterized parts and a comprehensive understanding of how to compose circuits are leading to a breakthrough in the ability to program living cells for advanced applications, from living therapeutics to the atomic manufacturing of functional materials.

24770324	Genome editing by Cas9, which cleaves double-stranded DNA at a sequence programmed by a short single-guide RNA (sgRNA), can result in off-target DNA modification that may be detrimental in some applications. To improve DNA cleavage specificity, we generated fusions of catalytically inactive Cas9 and FokI nuclease (fCas9). DNA cleavage by fCas9 requires association of two fCas9 monomers that simultaneously bind target sites ∼15 or 25 base pairs apart. In human cells, fCas9 modified target DNA sites with >140-fold higher specificity than wild-type Cas9 and with an efficiency similar to that of paired Cas9 'nickases', recently engineered variants that cleave only one DNA strand per monomer. The specificity of fCas9 was at least fourfold higher than that of paired nickases at loci with highly similar off-target sites. Target sites that conform to the substrate requirements of fCas9 occur on average every 34 bp in the human genome, suggesting the versatility of this approach for highly specific genome-wide editing.

24766887	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR), and associated proteins (Cas) comprise the CRISPR-Cas system, which confers adaptive immunity against exogenic elements in many bacteria and most archaea. CRISPR-mediated immunization occurs through the uptake of DNA from invasive genetic elements such as plasmids and viruses, followed by its integration into CRISPR loci. These loci are subsequently transcribed and processed into small interfering RNAs that guide nucleases for specific cleavage of complementary sequences. Conceptually, CRISPR-Cas shares functional features with the mammalian adaptive immune system, while also exhibiting characteristics of Lamarckian evolution. Because immune markers spliced from exogenous agents are integrated iteratively in CRISPR loci, they constitute a genetic record of vaccination events and reflect environmental conditions and changes over time. Cas endonucleases, which can be reprogrammed by small guide RNAs have shown unprecedented potential and flexibility for genome editing and can be repurposed for numerous DNA targeting applications including transcriptional control.

24764077	Among tetrapods, only urodele salamanders, such as the axolotl Ambystoma mexicanum, can completely regenerate limbs as adults. The mystery of why salamanders, but not other animals, possess this ability has for generations captivated scientists seeking to induce this phenomenon in other vertebrates. Although many recent advances in molecular biology have allowed limb regeneration and tissue repair in the axolotl to be investigated in increasing detail, the molecular toolkit for the study of this process has been limited. Here, we report that the CRISPR-Cas9 RNA-guided nuclease system can efficiently create mutations at targeted sites within the axolotl genome. We identify individual animals treated with RNA-guided nucleases that have mutation frequencies close to 100% at targeted sites. We employ this technique to completely functionally ablate EGFP expression in transgenic animals and recapitulate developmental phenotypes produced by loss of the conserved gene brachyury. Thus, this advance allows a reverse genetic approach in the axolotl and will undoubtedly provide invaluable insight into the mechanisms of salamanders' unique regenerative ability.

Our results demonstrate that Cas9-induced DNA breaks promote efficient rearrangement between pairs of targeted loci, providing a highly tractable approach for the study of genomic rearrangements.

24755959	Small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) are universally distributed in all three domains of life, Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukaryotes. In bacteria, sRNAs typically function by binding near the translation start site of their target mRNAs and thereby inhibit or activate translation. In eukaryotes, miRNAs and siRNAs typically bind to the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of their target mRNAs and influence translation efficiency and/or mRNA stability. In archaea, sRNAs have been identified in all species investigated using bioinformatic approaches, RNomics, and RNA-Seq. Their size can vary significantly between less than 50 to more than 500 nucleotides. Differential expression of sRNA genes has been studied using northern blot analysis, microarrays, and RNA-Seq. In addition, biological functions have been unraveled by genetic approaches, i.e., by characterization of designed mutants. As in bacteria, it was revealed that archaeal sRNAs are involved in many biological processes, including metabolic regulation, adaptation to extreme conditions, stress responses, and even in regulation of morphology and cellular behavior. Recently, the first target mRNAs were identified in archaea, including one sRNA that binds to the 5'-region of two mRNAs in Methanosarcina mazei Gö1 and a few sRNAs that bind to 3'-UTRs in Sulfolobus solfataricus, three Pyrobaculum species, and Haloferax volcanii, indicating that archaeal sRNAs appear to be able to target both the 5'-UTR or the 3'-UTRs of their respective target mRNAs. In addition, archaea contain tRNA-derived fragments (tRFs), and one tRF has been identified as a major ribosome-binding sRNA in H. volcanii, which downregulates translation in response to stress. Besides regulatory sRNAs, archaea contain further classes of sRNAs, e.g., CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) and snoRNAs.

24753403	CRISPR-Cas is an adaptive prokaryotic immune system, providing protection against viruses and other mobile genetic elements. In type I and type III CRISPR-Cas systems, CRISPR RNA (crRNA) is generated by cleavage of a primary transcript by the Cas6 endonuclease and loaded into multisubunit surveillance/effector complexes, allowing homology-directed detection and cleavage of invading elements. Highly studied CRISPR-Cas systems such as those in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have a single Cas6 enzyme that is an integral subunit of the surveillance complex. By contrast, Sulfolobus solfataricus has a complex CRISPR-Cas system with three types of surveillance complexes (Cascade/type I-A, CSM/type III-A and CMR/type III-B), five Cas6 paralogues and two different CRISPR-repeat families (AB and CD). Here, we investigate the kinetic properties of two different Cas6 paralogues from S. solfataricus. The Cas6-1 subtype is specific for CD-family CRISPR repeats, generating crRNA by multiple turnover catalysis whilst Cas6-3 has a broader specificity and also processes a non-coding RNA with a CRISPR repeat-related sequence. Deep sequencing of crRNA in surveillance complexes reveals a biased distribution of spacers derived from AB and CD loci, suggesting functional coupling between Cas6 paralogues and their downstream effector complexes.

24743236	Although modulation of protein levels is an important tool for study of protein function, it is difficult or impossible to knockdown or knockout genes that are critical for cell growth or viability. For such genes, a conditional knockdown approach would be valuable. The FKBP protein-based destabilization domain (DD)-tagging approach, which confers instability to the tagged protein in the absence of the compound Shield-1, has been shown to provide rapid control of protein levels determined by Shield-1 concentration. Although a strategy to knock-in DD-tagged protein at the endogenous loci has been employed in certain parasite studies, partly due to the relative ease of knock-in as a result of their mostly haploid lifecycles, this strategy has not been demonstrated in diploid or hyperploid mammalian cells due to the relative difficulty of achieving complete knock-in in all alleles. The recent advent of CRISPR/Cas9 homing endonuclease-mediated targeted genome cleavage has been shown to allow highly efficient homologous recombination at the targeted locus. We therefore assessed the feasibility of using CRISPR/Cas9 to achieve complete knock-in to DD-tag the essential gene Treacher Collins-Franceschetti syndrome 1 (TCOF1) in human 293T cells. Using a double antibiotic selection strategy to select clones with at least two knock-in alleles, we obtained numerous complete knock-in clones within three weeks of initial transfection. DD-TCOF1 expression in the knock-in cells was Shield-1 concentration-dependent, and removal of Shield-1 resulted in destabilization of DD-TCOF1 over the course of hours. We further confirmed that the tagged TCOF1 retained the nucleolar localization of the wild-type untagged protein, and that destabilization of DD-TCOF1 resulted in impaired cell growth, as expected for a gene implicated in ribosome biogenesis. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homologous recombination to completely knock-in a DD tag likely represents a generalizable and efficient strategy to achieve rapid modulation of protein levels in mammalian cells.

24735398	The pectinolytic enterobacteria of the Pectobacterium and Dickeya genera are causative agents of maceration-associated diseases affecting a wide variety of crops and ornamentals. For the past decade, the emergence of a novel species D. solani was observed in potato fields in Europe and the Mediterranean basin. The purpose of this study is to search by comparative genomics the genetic traits that could be distinctive to other Dickeya species and be involved in D. solani adaptation to the potato plant host.	D. solani 3337 exhibits a 4.9 Mb circular genome that is characterized by a low content in mobile elements with the identification of only two full length insertion sequences. A genomic comparison with the deeply-annotated model D. dadantii 3937 strain was performed. While a large majority of Dickeya virulence genes are shared by both strains, a few hundreds genes of D. solani 3337, mostly regrouped in 25 genomic regions, are distinctive to D. dadantii 3937. These genomic regions are present in the other available draft genomes of D. solani strains and interestingly some of them were not found in the sequenced genomes of the other Dickeya species. These genomic regions regroup metabolic genes and are often accompanied by genes involved in transport systems. A metabolic analysis correlated some metabolic genes with distinctive functional traits of both D. solani 3337 and D. dadantii 3937. Three identified D. solani genomic regions also regroup NRPS/PKS encoding genes. In addition, D. solani encodes a distinctive arsenal of T5SS and T6SS-related toxin-antitoxin systems. These genes may contribute to bacteria-bacteria interactions and to the fitness of D. solani to the plant environment.	This study highlights the genomic specific traits of the emerging pathogen D. solani and will provide the basis for studying those that are involved in the successful adaptation of this emerging pathogen to the potato plant host.

24728991	During the process of prokaryotic CRISPR adaptation, a copy of a segment of foreign deoxyribonucleic acid referred to as protospacer is added to the CRISPR cassette and becomes a spacer. When a protospacer contains a neighboring target interference motif, the specific small CRISPR ribonucleic acid (crRNA) transcribed from expanded CRISPR cassette can protect a prokaryotic cell from virus infection or plasmid transformation and conjugation. We show that in Escherichia coli, a vast majority of plasmid protospacers generate spacers integrated in CRISPR cassette in two opposing orientations, leading to frequent appearance of complementary spacer pairs in a population of cells that underwent CRISPR adaptation. When a protospacer contains a spacer acquisition motif AAG, spacer orientation that generates functional protective crRNA is strongly preferred. All other protospacers give rise to spacers oriented in both ways at comparable frequencies. This phenomenon increases the repertoire of available spacers and should make it more likely that a protective crRNA is formed as a result of CRISPR adaptation.

24724846	Removing an antibiotic resistance gene allows the same antibiotic to be re-used in the next round of genetic manipulation. Here we applied the CRISPR/Cas system to disrupt the puromycin resistance gene in an engineered mouse embryonic stem cell line and then re-used puromycin selection in the resulting cells to establish stable reporter cell lines. With the CRISPR/Cas system, pre-engineered sequences, such as loxP or FRT, are not required. Thus, this technique can be used to disrupt antibiotic resistance genes that cannot be removed by the Cre-loxP and Flp-FRT systems.	P Ni|Q Zhang|H Chen|L Chen

24717434	Targeted genome editing technologies are powerful tools for studying biology and disease, and have a broad range of research applications. In contrast to the rapid development of toolkits to manipulate individual genes, large-scale screening methods based on the complete loss of gene expression are only now beginning to be developed. Here we report the development of a focused CRISPR/Cas-based (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated) lentiviral library in human cells and a method of gene identification based on functional screening and high-throughput sequencing analysis. Using knockout library screens, we successfully identified the host genes essential for the intoxication of cells by anthrax and diphtheria toxins, which were confirmed by functional validation. The broad application of this powerful genetic screening strategy will not only facilitate the rapid identification of genes important for bacterial toxicity but will also enable the discovery of genes that participate in other biological processes.

24713045	Within the genus Streptococcus, only Streptococcus thermophilus is used as a starter culture in food fermentations. Streptococcus macedonicus though, which belongs to the Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus complex (SBSEC), is also frequently isolated from fermented foods mainly of dairy origin. Members of the SBSEC have been implicated in human endocarditis and colon cancer. Here we compare the genome sequence of the dairy isolate S. macedonicus ACA-DC 198 to the other SBSEC genomes in order to assess in silico its potential adaptation to milk and its pathogenicity status.	Despite the fact that the SBSEC species were found tightly related based on whole genome phylogeny of streptococci, two distinct patterns of evolution were identified among them. Streptococcus macedonicus, Streptococcus infantarius CJ18 and Streptococcus pasteurianus ATCC 43144 seem to have undergone reductive evolution resulting in significantly diminished genome sizes and increased percentages of potential pseudogenes when compared to Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus. In addition, the three species seem to have lost genes for catabolizing complex plant carbohydrates and for detoxifying toxic substances previously linked to the ability of S. gallolyticus to survive in the rumen. Analysis of the S. macedonicus genome revealed features that could support adaptation to milk, including an extra gene cluster for lactose and galactose metabolism, a proteolytic system for casein hydrolysis, auxotrophy for several vitamins, an increased ability to resist bacteriophages and horizontal gene transfer events with the dairy Lactococcus lactis and S. thermophilus as potential donors. In addition, S. macedonicus lacks several pathogenicity-related genes found in S. gallolyticus. For example, S. macedonicus has retained only one (i.e. the pil3) of the three pilus gene clusters which may mediate the binding of S. gallolyticus to the extracellular matrix. Unexpectedly, similar findings were obtained not only for the dairy S. infantarius CJ18, but also for the blood isolate S. pasteurianus ATCC 43144.	Our whole genome analyses suggest traits of adaptation of S. macedonicus to the nutrient-rich dairy environment. During this process the bacterium gained genes presumably important for this new ecological niche. Finally, S. macedonicus carries a reduced number of putative SBSEC virulence factors, which suggests a diminished pathogenic potential.

24711427	Prokaryotes encode adaptive immune systems, called CRISPR-Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-CRISPR associated), to provide resistance against mobile invaders, such as viruses and plasmids. Host immunity is based on incorporation of invader DNA sequences in a memory locus (CRISPR), the formation of guide RNAs from this locus, and the degradation of cognate invader DNA (protospacer). Invaders can escape type I-E CRISPR-Cas immunity in Escherichia coli K12 by making point mutations in the seed region of the protospacer or its adjacent motif (PAM), but hosts quickly restore immunity by integrating new spacers in a positive-feedback process termed "priming." Here, by using a randomized protospacer and PAM library and high-throughput plasmid loss assays, we provide a systematic analysis of the constraints of both direct interference and subsequent priming in E. coli. We have defined a high-resolution genetic map of direct interference by Cascade and Cas3, which includes five positions of the protospacer at 6-nt intervals that readily tolerate mutations. Importantly, we show that priming is an extremely robust process capable of using degenerate target regions, with up to 13 mutations throughout the PAM and protospacer region. Priming is influenced by the number of mismatches, their position, and is nucleotide dependent. Our findings imply that even outdated spacers containing many mismatches can induce a rapid primed CRISPR response against diversified or related invaders, giving microbes an advantage in the coevolutionary arms race with their invaders.

24710347	Genetic modification, including plant breeding, has been widely used to improve crop yield and quality, as well as to increase disease resistance. Targeted genome engineering is expected to contribute significantly to future varietal improvement, and genome editing technologies using zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9/single guide RNA (sgRNA) have already been successfully used to genetically modify plants. However, to date, there has been no reported use of any of the current genome editing approaches in sweet orange, an important fruit crop. In this study, we first developed a novel tool, Xcc-facilitated agroinfiltration, for enhancing transient protein expression in sweet orange leaves. We then successfully employed Xcc-facilitated agroinfiltration to deliver Cas9, along with a synthetic sgRNA targeting the CsPDS gene, into sweet orange. DNA sequencing confirmed that the CsPDS gene was mutated at the target site in treated sweet orange leaves. The mutation rate using the Cas9/sgRNA system was approximately 3.2 to 3.9%. Off-target mutagenesis was not detected for CsPDS-related DNA sequences in our study. This is the first report of targeted genome modification in citrus using the Cas9/sgRNA system-a system that holds significant promise for the study of citrus gene function and for targeted genetic modification.

24709635	Studies of gene function in non-model animals have been limited by the approaches available for eliminating gene function. The CRISPR/Cas9 (C: lustered R: egularly I: nterspaced S: hort P: alindromic R: epeats/ C: RISPR AS: sociated) system has recently become a powerful tool for targeted genome editing. Here, we report the use of the CRISPR/Cas9 system to disrupt selected genes, including nanos2, nanos3, dmrt1, and foxl2, with efficiencies as high as 95%. In addition, mutations in dmrt1 and foxl2 induced by CRISPR/Cas9 were efficiently transmitted through the germline to F1. Obvious phenotypes were observed in the G0 generation after mutation of germ cell or somatic cell-specific genes. For example, loss of Nanos2 and Nanos3 in XY and XX fish resulted in germ cell-deficient gonads as demonstrated by GFP labeling and Vasa staining, respectively, while masculinization of somatic cells in both XY and XX gonads was demonstrated by Dmrt1 and Cyp11b2 immunohistochemistry and by up-regulation of serum androgen levels. Our data demonstrate that targeted, heritable gene editing can be achieved in tilapia, providing a convenient and effective approach for generating loss-of-function mutants. Furthermore, our study shows the utility of the CRISPR/Cas9 system for genetic engineering in non-model species like tilapia and potentially in many other teleost species.

24704746	The discovery of CRISPR-Cas (clustered, regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-CRISPR-associated proteins) adaptive immune systems in prokaryotes has been one of the most exciting advances in microbiology in the past decade. Their role in host protection against mobile genetic elements is now well established, but there is mounting evidence that these systems modulate other processes, such as the genetic regulation of group behaviour and virulence, DNA repair and genome evolution. In this Progress article, we discuss recent studies that have provided insights into these unconventional CRISPR-Cas functions and consider their potential evolutionary implications. Understanding the role of CRISPR-Cas in these processes will improve our understanding of the evolution and maintenance of CRISPR-Cas systems in prokaryotic genomes.	ER Westra|A Buckling|PC Fineran
24704174	The targeted introduction of mutations utilizing sequence specific transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) 9 system (RNA-guided nucleases, RGNs) has revolutionized reverse genetic approaches in numerous model organisms. In zebrafish, both systems were successfully applied to generate loss-of-function alleles by targeting open reading frames or deletion and inversion of whole chromosomal regions. In addition to the production of these loss-of-function alleles, genomic engineering by insertion of short sequences utilizing single stranded DNA oligonucleotides as templates for homology based repair was made possible, enabling effective insertion of loxP sites or tags for protein coding genes. Recent studies based on homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining have also broadened the repertoire for genome editing. These approaches allow the targeted insertion of open reading frames or even whole donor vectors. In this review we summarize the use of TALENs and RNA-guided nucleases in the field of zebrafish genetics with a special focus on knock-in approaches.	TO Auer|F Del Bene

24698835	Bombyx mori is an economically important insect and a model organism for studying lepidopteran and arthropod biology. Using a highly efficient CRISPR/Cas9 system, we showed that this system could mediate highly efficient targeted genome editing of a single gene locus, large chromosomal deletion or inversion, and also multiplex genome editing of 6 genes simultaneously in BmNs cell line derived from B. mori. The simplicity and high efficiency of our system provide unprecedented possibilities for researchers to implement precise and sophisticated manipulation of a chosen B. mori gene in BmNs cells easily in a limited time course, and perhaps new opportunities for functional genomics of B. mori and other lepidopteran insects.

24691488	The development of human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) facilitates in vitro studies of human disease mechanisms, speeds up the process of drug screening, and raises the feasibility of using cell replacement therapy in clinics. However, the study of genotype-phenotype relationships in ESCs or iPSCs is hampered by the low efficiency of site-specific gene editing. Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) spurred interest due to the ease of assembly, high efficiency and faithful gene targeting. In this study, we optimized the TALEN design to maximize its genomic cutting efficiency. We showed that using optimized TALENs in conjunction with single-strand oligodeoxynucleotide (ssODN) allowed efficient gene editing in human cells. Gene mutations and gene deletions for up to 7.8 kb can be accomplished at high efficiencies. We established human tumor cell lines and H9 ESC lines with homozygous deletion of the microRNA-21 (miR-21) gene and miR-9-2 gene. These cell lines provide a robust platform to dissect the roles these genes play during cell differentiation and tumorigenesis. We also observed that the endogenous homologous chromosome can serve as a donor template for gene editing. Overall, our studies demonstrate the versatility of using ssODN and TALEN to establish genetically modified cells for research and therapeutic application.

24685391	The development in early 2013 of CRISPR/Cas9-based genome engineering promises to dramatically advance our ability to alter the genomes of model systems at will. A single, easily produced targeting RNA guides the Cas9 endonuclease to a specific DNA sequence where it creates a double strand break. Imprecise repair of the break can yield mutations, while homologous recombination with a repair template can be used to effect specific changes to the genome. The tremendous potential of this system led several groups to independently adapt it for use in Caenorhabditiselegans, where it was successfully used to generate mutations and to create tailored genome changes through homologous recombination. Here, we review the different approaches taken to adapt CRISPR/Cas9 for C. elegans, and provide practical guidelines for CRISPR/Cas9-based genome engineering.	S Waaijers|M Boxem
24675426	The CRISPR/Cas system, in which the Cas9 endonuclease and a guide RNA complementary to the target are sufficient for RNA-guided cleavage of the target DNA, is a powerful new approach recently developed for targeted gene disruption in various animal models. However, there is little verification of microinjection methods for generating knockout mice using this approach. Here, we report the verification of microinjection methods of the CRISPR/Cas system. We compared three methods for injection: (1) injection of DNA into the pronucleus, (2) injection of RNA into the pronucleus, and (3) injection of RNA into the cytoplasm. We found that injection of RNA into the cytoplasm was the most efficient method in terms of the numbers of viable blastocyst stage embryos and full-term pups generated. This method also showed the best overall knockout efficiency.	T Horii|Y Arai|M Yamazaki|S Morita|M Kimura|M Itoh|Y Abe|I Hatada
24674991	Prostaglandins (PGs) are important regulators of female reproductive function. The primary PGs produced in the endometrium are PGE2 and PGF2α. Relatively little is known about the biosynthetic pathways leading to the formation of PGF2α. We have described the role of aldo-ketoreductase (AKR)1B1 in increased PGF2α production by human endometrial cells following stimulation with interleukin-1β (IL-1β). However, alternate PGF synthases are expressed concurrently in endometrial cells. A definite proof of the role of AKR1B1 would require gene knockout; unfortunately, this gene has no direct equivalent in the mouse. Recently, an efficient genome-editing technology using RNA-guided DNase Cas9 and the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) system has been developed. We have adapted this approach to knockout AKR1B1 gene expression in human endometrial cell lines. One clone (16-2) of stromal origin generated by the CRISPR/Cas9 system exhibited a complete loss of AKR1B1 protein and mRNA expression, whereas other clones presented with partial edition. The present report focuses on the characterization of clone 16-2 exhibiting deletion of 68 and 2 nucleotides, respectively, on each of the alleles. Cells from this clone lost their ability to produce PGF2α but maintained their original stromal cell (human endometrial stromal cells-2) phenotype including the capacity to decidualize in the presence of progesterone (medroxyprogesterone acetate) and 8-bromo-cAMP. Knockout cells also maintained their ability to increase PGE2 production in response to IL-1β. In summary, we demonstrate that the new genome editing CRISPR/Cas9 system can be used in human cells to generate stable knockout cell line models. Our results suggest that genome editing of human cell lines can be used to complement mouse KO models to validate the function of genes in differentiated tissues and cells. Our results also confirm that AKR1B1 is involved in the synthesis of PGF2α.	N Lacroix Pépin|P Chapdelaine|Y Rodriguez|JP Tremblay|MA Fortier
24674878	The recent development of tools for precise editing of user-specified sequences is rapidly changing the landscape for plant genetics and biotechnology. It is now possible to target mutations and regulatory proteins to specific sites in a genome using zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like endonucleases (TALENs), or the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) system. Here we provide an update of recent developments in CRISPR/Cas9 technology and highlight online resources that will help biologists adopt new genome-editing tools.	J Lozano-Juste|SR Cutler
24674812	Significant progress is being made in defining the genetic etiology of schizophrenia. As the list of implicated genes grows, parallel developments in gene editing technology provide new methods to investigate gene function in model systems. The confluence of these two research fields--gene discovery and functional biology--may offer novel insights into schizophrenia etiology. We review recent advances in these fields, consider the likely obstacles to progress, and consider strategies as to how these can be overcome.	SE McCarthy|WR McCombie|A Corvin
24665839	The development of custom-designed nucleases (CDNs), including zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), has made it possible to perform precise genetic engineering in many cell types and species. More recently, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) system has been successfully employed for genome editing. These RNA-guided DNA endonucleases are shown to be more efficient and flexible than CDNs and hold great potential for applications in both biological studies and medicine. Here, we review the progress that has been made for all three genome editing technologies in modifying both cells and model organisms, compare important aspects of each approach, and summarize the applications of these tools in disease modeling and gene therapy. In the end, we discuss future prospects of the field.	M Cai|Y Yang
24655229	To elucidate the Campylobacter jejuni population in organically farmed laying hens in Finland, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was combined with characterization of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) sequences.	A total of 147 Camp. jejuni isolates, collected from organically farmed laying hens from 18 farms in 2003-2004, were previously analysed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. In the present study, subsets of the isolates were further analysed by MLST and CRISPR sequences. Fourteen STs were found by MLST. ST-50 (27%, 7/18 farms), ST-3272 (20%, 8/18 farms), ST-45 (12%, 7/18 farms) and ST-356 (12%, 5/18 farms) were the most common STs. CRISPR types were identical among all isolates of ST-50 (ST-21 clonal complex (CC)) and the most variable among ST-45 (ST-45 CC).	ST-3272 (UA), a common ST in this study, has been infrequently detected in other hosts. Other major STs (ST-50 and ST-45) have been common in several hosts such as conventional poultry and bovines. CRISPR typing provided additional discrimination between isolates of certain dominant STs and could be useful in further epidemiological studies.	This study gives new information about MLST and CRISPR types of Camp. jejuni among organically farmed laying hens.	SM Kovanen|RI Kivistö|M Rossi|ML Hänninen
24651067	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) protein 9 system provides a robust and multiplexable genome editing tool, enabling researchers to precisely manipulate specific genomic elements, and facilitating the elucidation of target gene function in biology and diseases. CRISPR/Cas9 comprises of a nonspecific Cas9 nuclease and a set of programmable sequence-specific CRISPR RNA (crRNA), which can guide Cas9 to cleave DNA and generate double-strand breaks at target sites. Subsequent cellular DNA repair process leads to desired insertions, deletions or substitutions at target sites. The specificity of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated DNA cleavage requires target sequences matching crRNA and a protospacer adjacent motif locating at downstream of target sequences. Here, we review the molecular mechanism, applications and challenges of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing and clinical therapeutic potential of CRISPR/Cas9 in future.	F Zhang|Y Wen|X Guo
24647603	Vision is the most important human sense. It facilitates every major activity of daily living ranging from basic communication, mobility and independence to an appreciation of art and nature. Heritable diseases of the retina, such as age-related macular degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa, are the leading cause of blindness in the developed world, collectively affecting as many as one-third of all people over the age of 75, to some degree. For decades, scientists have dreamed of preventing vision loss or of restoring the vision of patients affected with retinal degeneration through some type of drug, gene or cell-based transplantation approach. In this review, we will discuss the current literature pertaining to retinal transplantation. We will focus on the use of induced pluripotent stem cells for interrogation of disease pathophysiology, analysis of drug and gene therapeutics and as a source of autologous cells for cell replacement.

24632195	The last several years have witnessed an explosion in the understanding and use of novel, versatile trans-acting elements. TALEs, CRISPR/Cas, and sRNAs can be easily fashioned to bind any specific sequence of DNA (TALEs, CRISPR/Cas) or RNA (sRNAs) because of the simple rules governing their interactions with nucleic acids. This unique property enables these tools to repress the expression of genes at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional levels, respectively, without prior manipulation of cis-acting and/or chromosomal target DNA sequences. These tools are now being harnessed by synthetic biologists, particularly those in the eukaryotic community, for genome-wide regulation, editing, or epigenetic studies. Here we discuss the exciting opportunities for using TALEs, CRISPR/Cas, and sRNAs as synthetic trans-acting regulators in prokaryotes.	MF Copeland|MC Politz|BF Pfleger
24628983	CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) is a prokaryotic adaptive defence system that provides resistance against alien replicons such as viruses and plasmids. Spacers in a CRISPR cassette confer immunity against viruses and plasmids containing regions complementary to the spacers and hence they retain a footprint of interactions between prokaryotes and their viruses in individual strains and ecosystems. The human gut is a rich habitat populated by numerous microorganisms, but a large fraction of these are unculturable and little is known about them in general and their CRISPR systems in particular.	We used human gut metagenomic data from three open projects in order to characterize the composition and dynamics of CRISPR cassettes in the human-associated microbiota. Applying available CRISPR-identification algorithms and a previously designed filtering procedure to the assembled human gut metagenomic contigs, we found 388 CRISPR cassettes, 373 of which had repeats not observed previously in complete genomes or other datasets. Only 171 of 3,545 identified spacers were coupled with protospacers from the human gut metagenomic contigs. The number of matches to GenBank sequences was negligible, providing protospacers for 26 spacers.Reconstruction of CRISPR cassettes allowed us to track the dynamics of spacer content. In agreement with other published observations we show that spacers shared by different cassettes (and hence likely older ones) tend to the trailer ends, whereas spacers with matches in the metagenomes are distributed unevenly across cassettes, demonstrating a preference to form clusters closer to the active end of a CRISPR cassette, adjacent to the leader, and hence suggesting dynamical interactions between prokaryotes and viruses in the human gut. Remarkably, spacers match protospacers in the metagenome of the same individual with frequency comparable to a random control, but may match protospacers from metagenomes of other individuals.	The analysis of assembled contigs is complementary to the approach based on the analysis of original reads and hence provides additional data about composition and evolution of CRISPR cassettes, revealing the dynamics of CRISPR-phage interactions in metagenomes.

24628660	Mapping the genes responsible for natural variation and divergence is a challenging task. Many studies have mapped genes to genomic regions or generated lists of candidates, but few studies have implicated specific genes with a high standard of evidence. I propose that combining recent advances in genomic engineering with a modified version of the quantitative complementation test will help turn candidate genes into causal genes. By creating loss-of-function mutations in natural strains, and using these mutations to quantitatively fail-to-complement natural alleles, fine mapping should be greatly facilitated. As an example, I propose that the CRISPR/Cas9 system could be combined with the FLP/FRT system to fine-map genes in the numerous systems where inversions have frustrated these efforts.	TL Turner

24600041	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) genes are present in many bacterial and archaeal genomes. Since the discovery of the typical CRISPR loci in the 1980s, well before their physiological role was revealed, their variable sequences have been used as a complementary typing tool in diagnostic, epidemiologic, and evolutionary analyses of prokaryotic strains. The discovery that CRISPR spacers are often identical to sequence fragments of mobile genetic elements was a major breakthrough that eventually led to the elucidation of CRISPR-Cas as an adaptive immunity system. Key elements of this unique prokaryotic defense system are small CRISPR RNAs that guide nucleases to complementary target nucleic acids of invading viruses and plasmids, generally followed by the degradation of the invader. In addition, several recent studies have pointed at direct links of CRISPR-Cas to regulation of a range of stress-related phenomena. An interesting example concerns a pathogenic bacterium that possesses a CRISPR-associated ribonucleoprotein complex that may play a dual role in defense and/or virulence. In this review, we describe recently reported cases of potential involvement of CRISPR-Cas systems in bacterial stress responses in general and bacterial virulence in particular.

24599066	Paenibacillus larvae, a Gram positive bacterial pathogen, causes American Foulbrood (AFB), which is the most serious infectious disease of honey bees. In order to investigate the genomic potential of P. larvae, two strains belonging to two different genotypes were sequenced and used for comparative genome analysis. The complete genome sequence of P. larvae strain DSM 25430 (genotype ERIC II) consisted of 4,056,006 bp and harbored 3,928 predicted protein-encoding genes. The draft genome sequence of P. larvae strain DSM 25719 (genotype ERIC I) comprised 4,579,589 bp and contained 4,868 protein-encoding genes. Both strains harbored a 9.7 kb plasmid and encoded a large number of virulence-associated proteins such as toxins and collagenases. In addition, genes encoding large multimodular enzymes producing nonribosomally peptides or polyketides were identified. In the genome of strain DSM 25719 seven toxin associated loci were identified and analyzed. Five of them encoded putatively functional toxins. The genome of strain DSM 25430 harbored several toxin loci that showed similarity to corresponding loci in the genome of strain DSM 25719, but were non-functional due to point mutations or disruption by transposases. Although both strains cause AFB, significant differences between the genomes were observed including genome size, number and composition of transposases, insertion elements, predicted phage regions, and strain-specific island-like regions. Transposases, integrases and recombinases are important drivers for genome plasticity. A total of 390 and 273 mobile elements were found in strain DSM 25430 and strain DSM 25719, respectively. Comparative genomics of both strains revealed acquisition of virulence factors by horizontal gene transfer and provided insights into evolution and pathogenicity.

24598943	The CRISPR/Cas9 system has been proven to be an efficient gene-editing tool for genome modification of cells and organisms. Multiplex genetic engineering in rat holds a bright future for the study of complex disease. Here, we show that this system enables the simultaneous disruption of four genes (ApoE, B2m, Prf1, and Prkdc) in rats in one-step, by co-injection of Cas9 mRNA and sgRNAs into fertilized eggs. We further observed the gene modifications are germline transmittable, and confirmed the off-target mutagenesis and mosaicism are rarely detected by comprehensive analysis. Thus, the CRISPR/Cas9 system makes it possible to efficiently and reliably generate gene knock-out rats.	Y Ma|B Shen|X Zhang|Y Lu|W Chen|J Ma|X Huang|L Zhang
24595272	Many prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes feature a characteristic periodic signal in distribution of short runs of A or T (A-tracts) phased with the DNA helical period of ∼10-11 bp. Such periodic spacing of A-tracts has been associated with intrinsic DNA curvature. In eukaryotes, this periodicity is a major component of the nucleosome positioning signal but its physiological role in prokaryotes is not clear. One hypothesis centers on possible role of intrinsic DNA bends in nucleoid compaction. We use comparative genomics to investigate possible relationship between the A-tract periodicity and nucleoid-associated proteins in prokaryotes. We found that genomes with DNA-bridging proteins tend to exhibit stronger A-tract periodicity, presumably indicative of more prevalent intrinsic DNA curvature. A weaker relationship was detected for nucleoid-associated proteins that do not form DNA bridges. We consider these results an indication that intrinsic DNA curvature acts collaboratively with DNA-bridging proteins in maintaining the compact structure of the nucleoid, and that previously observed differences among prokaryotic genomes in terms DNA curvature-related sequence periodicity may reflect differences in nucleoid organization. We subsequently investigated the relationship between A-tract periodicity and presence of CRISPR elements and we found that genomes with CRISPR tend to have stronger A-tract periodicity. This result is consistent with our earlier hypothesis that extensive A-tract periodicity could help protect the chromosome against integration of prophages, possibly due to its role in compaction of the nucleoid.

24586036	The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) confers adaptive immunity against phages via sequence fragments (spacers) derived from mobile genetic elements (MGEs), thus serving as a memory of past host-phage co-evolution. To understand co-evolutionary dynamics in natural settings, we examined CRISPR diversity in 94 isolates of Microcystis aeruginosa from a small eutrophic pond. Fifty-two isolates possessed the CRISPR and were classified into 22 different CRISPR-related genotypes, suggesting stable coexistence of multiple genotypes with different phage susceptibility. Seven CRISPR-related genotypes showed variation of spacers at the leader-end of the CRISPR, indicating active spacer addition from MGEs. An abundant phylotype (based on the internal transcribed spacer of the rRNA gene) contained different CRISPR spacer genotypes with the same CRISPR-associated cas2 gene. These data suggest that selective phage infection and possibly plasmid transfer may contribute to maintenance of multiple genotypes of M. aeruginosa and that rapid co-evolution within a host-phage combination may be driven by increased contact frequency. Forty-two isolates lacked detectable CRISPR loci. Relative abundance of the CRISPR-lacking genotypes in the population suggests that CRISPR loss may be selected for enhanced genetic exchange.

24584096	Targeted genome editing using engineered nucleases has rapidly gone from being a niche technology to a mainstream method used by many biological researchers. This widespread adoption has been largely fueled by the emergence of the clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) technology, an important new approach for generating RNA-guided nucleases, such as Cas9, with customizable specificities. Genome editing mediated by these nucleases has been used to rapidly, easily and efficiently modify endogenous genes in a wide variety of biomedically important cell types and in organisms that have traditionally been challenging to manipulate genetically. Furthermore, a modified version of the CRISPR-Cas9 system has been developed to recruit heterologous domains that can regulate endogenous gene expression or label specific genomic loci in living cells. Although the genome-wide specificities of CRISPR-Cas9 systems remain to be fully defined, the power of these systems to perform targeted, highly efficient alterations of genome sequence and gene expression will undoubtedly transform biological research and spur the development of novel molecular therapeutics for human disease.

24579309	Bacteria and archaea have evolved an adaptive immune system, known as type II prokaryotic clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) system, which uses short RNA to direct the degradation of target sequences present in invading viral and plasmid DNAs. Recent advances in CRISPR/Cas system provide an improved method for genome editing, showing robust and specific RNA-guided endonuclease activity at targeted endogenous genomic loci. It is the latest technology to modify genome DNA specifically and effectively following zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and TALE nucleases (TALENs). Compared with ZFNs and TALENs, CRISPR/Cas is much simpler and easier to engineer. This review summarizes recent progress, and discusses the prospects of CRISPR/Cas system, with an emphasis on its structure, principle, applications and potential challenges.

24578404	CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) are a type of small non-coding RNA that form a key part of an acquired immune system in prokaryotes. Specific prediction methods find crRNA-encoding loci in nearly half of sequenced bacterial, and three quarters of archaeal, species. These Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) arrays consist of repeat elements alternating with specific spacers. Generally one strand is transcribed, producing long pre-crRNAs, which are processed to short crRNAs that base pair with invading nucleic acids to facilitate their destruction. No current software for the discovery of CRISPR loci predicts the direction of crRNA transcription.	We have developed an algorithm that accurately predicts the strand of the resulting crRNAs. The method uses as input CRISPR repeat predictions. CRISPRDirection uses parameters that are calculated from the CRISPR repeat predictions and flanking sequences, which are combined by weighted voting. The prediction may use prior coding sequence annotation but this is not required. CRISPRDirection correctly predicted the orientation of 94% of a reference set of arrays.

24576617	Genome engineering has revolutionised genetic analysis in many organisms. Here we describe a simple and efficient technique to generate and detect novel mutations in desired target genes in Drosophila melanogaster. We target double strand breaks to specific sites within the genome by injecting mRNA encoding the Cas9 endonuclease and in vitro transcribed synthetic guide RNA into Drosophila embryos. The small insertion and deletion mutations that result from inefficient non-homologous end joining at this site are detected by high resolution melt analysis of whole flies and individual wings, allowing stable lines to be made within 1 month.

24576457	Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) systems have emerged as powerful tools for genome editing in a variety of species. Here, we report, for the first time, targeted mutagenesis in Zea mays using TALENs and the CRISPR/Cas system. We designed five TALENs targeting 4 genes, namely ZmPDS, ZmIPK1A, ZmIPK, ZmMRP4, and obtained targeting efficiencies of up to 23.1% in protoplasts, and about 13.3% to 39.1% of the transgenic plants were somatic mutations. Also, we constructed two gRNAs targeting the ZmIPK gene in maize protoplasts, at frequencies of 16.4% and 19.1%, respectively. In addition, the CRISPR/Cas system induced targeted mutations in Z. mays protoplasts with efficiencies (13.1%) similar to those obtained with TALENs (9.1%). Our results show that both TALENs and the CRISPR/Cas system can be used for genome modification in maize.	Z Liang|K Zhang|K Chen|C Gao
24557908	The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) systems have evolved as an adaptive surveillance and defense mechanism in bacteria and archaea that uses short RNAs to direct degradation of foreign genetic elements. Here, we present our protocol for utilizing the S. pyogenes type II bacterial CRISPR system to achieve sequence-specific genome alterations in human cells. In principle, any genomic sequence of the form N₁₉NGG can be targeted with the generation of custom guide RNA (gRNA) which functions to direct the Cas9 protein to genomic targets and induce DNA cleavage. Here, we describe our methods for designing and generating gRNA expression constructs either singly or in a multiplexed manner, as well as optimized protocols for the delivery of Cas9-gRNA components into human cells. Genomic alterations at the target site are then introduced either through nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or through homologous recombination (HR) in the presence of an appropriate donor sequence. This RNA-guided editing tool offers greater ease of customization and synthesis in comparison to existing sequence-specific endonucleases and promises to become a highly versatile and multiplexable human genome engineering platform.

24555991	To combat potentially deadly viral infections, prokaryotic microbes enlist small RNA-based adaptive immune systems (CRISPR-Cas systems) that protect through sequence-specific recognition and targeted destruction of viral nucleic acids (either DNA or RNA depending on the system). Here, we summarize rapid progress made in redirecting the nuclease activities of these microbial immune systems to bind and cleave DNA or RNA targets of choice, by reprogramming the small guide RNAs of the various CRISPR-Cas complexes. These studies have demonstrated the potential of Type II CRISPR-Cas systems both as efficient and versatile genome-editing tools and as potent and specific regulators of gene expression in a broad range of cell types (including human) and organisms. Progress is also being made in developing a Type III RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas system as a novel gene knockdown platform to investigate gene function and modulate gene expression for metabolic engineering in microbes.

24550464	The CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat)/Cas (CRISPR-associated) system has emerged as a powerful tool for targeted gene editing in many organisms, including plants. However, all of the reported studies in plants focused on either transient systems or the first generation after the CRISPR/Cas system was stably transformed into plants. In this study we examined several plant generations with seven genes at 12 different target sites to determine the patterns, efficiency, specificity, and heritability of CRISPR/Cas-induced gene mutations or corrections in Arabidopsis. The proportion of plants bearing any mutations (chimeric, heterozygous, biallelic, or homozygous) was 71.2% at T1, 58.3% at T2, and 79.4% at T3 generations. CRISPR/Cas-induced mutations were predominantly 1 bp insertion and short deletions. Gene modifications detected in T1 plants occurred mostly in somatic cells, and consequently there were no T1 plants that were homozygous for a gene modification event. In contrast, ∼22% of T2 plants were found to be homozygous for a modified gene. All homozygotes were stable to the next generation, without any new modifications at the target sites. There was no indication of any off-target mutations by examining the target sites and sequences highly homologous to the target sites and by in-depth whole-genome sequencing.

24535568	Identification of genes influencing a phenotype of interest is frequently achieved through genetic screening by RNA interference (RNAi) or knockouts. However, RNAi may only achieve partial depletion of gene activity, and knockout-based screens are difficult in diploid mammalian cells. Here we took advantage of the efficiency and high throughput of genome editing based on type II, clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated (Cas) systems to introduce genome-wide targeted mutations in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). We designed 87,897 guide RNAs (gRNAs) targeting 19,150 mouse protein-coding genes and used a lentiviral vector to express these gRNAs in ESCs that constitutively express Cas9. Screening the resulting ESC mutant libraries for resistance to either Clostridium septicum alpha-toxin or 6-thioguanine identified 27 known and 4 previously unknown genes implicated in these phenotypes. Our results demonstrate the potential for efficient loss-of-function screening using the CRISPR-Cas9 system.	H Koike-Yusa|Y Li|EP Tan|Mdel C Velasco-Herrera|K Yusa
24531487	A multi-subunit ribonucleoprotein complex termed the Cmr RNA-silencing complex recognizes and destroys viral RNA in the CRISPR-mediated immune defence mechanism in many prokaryotes using an as yet unclear mechanism. In Archaeoglobus fulgidus, this complex consists of six subunits, Cmr1-Cmr6. Here, the crystal structure of Cmr1 from A. fulgidus is reported, revealing that the protein is composed of two tightly associated ferredoxin-like domains. The domain located at the N-terminus is structurally most similar to the N-terminal ferredoxin-like domain of the CRISPR RNA-processing enzyme Cas6 from Pyrococcus furiosus. An ensuing mutational analysis identified a highly conserved basic surface patch that binds single-stranded nucleic acids specifically, including the mature CRISPR RNA, but in a sequence-independent manner. In addition, this subunit was found to cleave single-stranded RNA. Together, these studies elucidate the structure and the catalytic activity of the Cmr1 subunit.

24531374	CRISPR adaptive immune systems were analyzed for all available completed genomes of archaea, which included representatives of each of the main archaeal phyla. Initially, all proteins encoded within, and proximal to, CRISPR-cas loci were clustered and analyzed using a profile-profile approach. Then cas genes were assigned to gene cassettes and to functional modules for adaptation and interference. CRISPR systems were then classified primarily on the basis of their concatenated Cas protein sequences and gene synteny of the interference modules. With few exceptions, they could be assigned to the universal Type I or Type III systems. For Type I, subtypes I-A, I-B, and I-D dominate but the data support the division of subtype I-B into two subtypes, designated I-B and I-G. About 70% of the Type III systems fall into the universal subtypes III-A and III-B but the remainder, some of which are phyla-specific, diverge significantly in Cas protein sequences, and/or gene synteny, and they are classified separately. Furthermore, a few CRISPR systems that could not be assigned to Type I or Type III are categorized as variant systems. Criteria are presented for assigning newly sequenced archaeal CRISPR systems to the different subtypes. Several accessory proteins were identified that show a specific gene linkage, especially to Type III interference modules, and these may be cofunctional with the CRISPR systems. Evidence is presented for extensive exchange having occurred between adaptation and interference modules of different archaeal CRISPR systems, indicating the wide compatibility of the functionally diverse interference complexes with the relatively conserved adaptation modules.

24521866	Genome editing with site-specific nucleases, such as zinc-finger nucleases or transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and RNA-guided nucleases, such as the CRISPR/Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated) system, is becoming the new standard for targeted genome modification in various organisms. Application of these techniques to the manufacture of knockout mice would be greatly aided by simple and easy methods for genotyping of mutant and wild-type pups among litters. However, there are no detailed or comparative reports concerning the identification of mutant mice generated using genome editing technologies. Here, we genotyped TALEN-derived enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) knockout mice using a combination of approaches, including fluorescence observation, heteroduplex mobility assay, restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and DNA sequencing. The detection sensitivities for TALEN-induced mutations differed among these methods, and we therefore concluded that combinatorial testing is necessary for the screening and determination of mutant genotypes. Since the analytical methods tested can be carried out without specialized equipment, costly reagents and/or sophisticated protocols, our report should be of interest to a broad range of researchers who are considering the application of genome editing technologies in various organisms.

24520560	“Mycobacterium canettii,” an opportunistic human pathogen living in an unknown environmental reservoir, is the progenitor species from which Mycobacterium tuberculosis emerged. Since its discovery in 1969, most of the ≈70 known M. canettii strains were isolated in the Republic of Djibouti, frequently from expatriate children and adults. We show here, by whole-genome sequencing, that most strains collected from February 2010 through March 2013, and associated with 2 outbreaks of lymph node tuberculosis in children, belong to a unique epidemic clone within M. canettii. Evolution of this clone, which has been recovered regularly since 1983, may mimic the birth of M. tuberculosis. Thus, recognizing this organism and identifying its reservoir are clinically important.

24505130	Type II CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-Cas (CRISPR-associated) systems use an RNA-guided DNA endonuclease, Cas9, to generate double-strand breaks in invasive DNA during an adaptive bacterial immune response. Cas9 has been harnessed as a powerful tool for genome editing and gene regulation in many eukaryotic organisms. We report 2.6 and 2.2 angstrom resolution crystal structures of two major Cas9 enzyme subtypes, revealing the structural core shared by all Cas9 family members. The architectures of Cas9 enzymes define nucleic acid binding clefts, and single-particle electron microscopy reconstructions show that the two structural lobes harboring these clefts undergo guide RNA-induced reorientation to form a central channel where DNA substrates are bound. The observation that extensive structural rearrangements occur before target DNA duplex binding implicates guide RNA loading as a key step in Cas9 activation.

24498453	Serotype-specific PCR assays targeting Salmonella enterica serotypes Typhi and Paratyphi A, the causal agents of typhoid and paratyphoid fevers, are required to accelerate formal diagnosis and to overcome the lack of typing sera and, in some situations, the need for culture. However, the sensitivity and specificity of such assays must be demonstrated on large collections of strains representative of the targeted serotypes and all other bacterial populations producing similar clinical symptoms.	Using a new family of repeated DNA sequences, CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats), as a serotype-specific target, we developed a conventional multiplex PCR assay for the detection and differentiation of serotypes Typhi and Paratyphi A from cultured isolates. We also developed EvaGreen-based real-time singleplex PCR assays with the same two sets of primers.	We achieved 100% sensitivity and specificity for each protocol after validation of the assays on 188 serotype Typhi and 74 serotype Paratyphi A strains from diverse genetic groups, geographic origins and time periods and on 70 strains of bacteria frequently encountered in bloodstream infections, including 29 other Salmonella serotypes and 42 strains from 38 other bacterial species.	The performance and convenience of our serotype-specific PCR assays should facilitate the rapid and accurate identification of these two major serotypes in a large range of clinical and public health laboratories with access to PCR technology. These assays were developed for use with DNA from cultured isolates, but with modifications to the assay, the CRISPR targets could be used in the development of assays for use with clinical and other samples.

24491566	The mammalian zygote-mediated CRISPR/Cas system can efficiently generate targeted genome-modified animals. However, this system is limited by the risk of off-target mutations.

24487629	Here, we report a convenient and efficient miRNA inhibition strategy employing the CRISPR system. Using specifically designed gRNAs, miRNA gene has been cut at a single site by Cas9, resulting in knockdown of the miRNA in murine cells. Using a modified CRISPR interference system (CRISPRi), inactive Cas9 can reversibly prevent the expression of both monocistronic miRNAs and polycistronic miRNA clusters. Furthermore, CRISPR/CRISPRi is also capable of suppressing genes in porcine cells.	Y Zhao|Z Dai|Y Liang|M Yin|K Ma|M He|H Ouyang|CB Teng

24480743	Recent advances in our ability to design DNA binding factors with specificity for desired sequences have resulted in a revolution in genetic engineering, enabling directed changes to the genome to be made relatively easily. Traditional techniques for generating genetic mutations in most organisms have relied on selection from large pools of randomly induced mutations for those of particular interest, or time-consuming gene targeting by homologous recombination. Drosophila melanogaster has always been at the forefront of genetic analysis, and application of these new genome editing techniques to this organism will revolutionise our approach to performing analysis of gene function in the future. We discuss the recent techniques that apply the CRISPR/Cas9 system to Drosophila, highlight potential uses for this technology and speculate upon the future of genome engineering in this model organism.

24480304	Helicases utilize NTPs to modulate their binding to nucleic acids and many of these enzymes also unwind DNA or RNA duplexes in an NTP-dependent fashion. These proteins are phylogenetically related but functionally diverse, with essential roles in virtually all aspects of nucleic acid metabolism. A new class of helicases associated with RNA-guided adaptive immune systems in bacteria and archaea has recently been identified. Prokaryotes acquire resistance to invading genetic parasites by integrating short fragments of foreign nucleic acids into repetitive loci in the host chromosome known as CRISPRs (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats). CRISPR-associated gene 3 (cas3) encodes a conserved helicase protein that is essential for phage defense. Here we review recent advances in Cas3 biology, and provide a new phylogenetic framework that positions Cas3 in the helicase family tree. We anticipate that this Cas3 phylogeny will guide future biochemical and structural studies.	RN Jackson|M Lavin|J Carter|B Wiedenheft
24476820	The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated enzyme Cas9 is an RNA-guided endonuclease that uses RNA-DNA base-pairing to target foreign DNA in bacteria. Cas9-guide RNA complexes are also effective genome engineering agents in animals and plants. Here we use single-molecule and bulk biochemical experiments to determine how Cas9-RNA interrogates DNA to find specific cleavage sites. We show that both binding and cleavage of DNA by Cas9-RNA require recognition of a short trinucleotide protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). Non-target DNA binding affinity scales with PAM density, and sequences fully complementary to the guide RNA but lacking a nearby PAM are ignored by Cas9-RNA. Competition assays provide evidence that DNA strand separation and RNA-DNA heteroduplex formation initiate at the PAM and proceed directionally towards the distal end of the target sequence. Furthermore, PAM interactions trigger Cas9 catalytic activity. These results reveal how Cas9 uses PAM recognition to quickly identify potential target sites while scanning large DNA molecules, and to regulate scission of double-stranded DNA.

24462858	Specific gene knockout and rescue experiments are powerful tools in developmental and stem cell biology. Nevertheless, the experiments require multiple steps of molecular manipulation for gene knockout and subsequent rescue procedures. Here we report an efficient and single step strategy to generate gene knockout-rescue system in pluripotent stem cells by promoter insertion with CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology. We inserted a tetracycline-regulated inducible gene promoter (tet-OFF/TRE-CMV) upstream of the endogenous promoter region of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2/Flk1) gene, an essential gene for endothelial cell (EC) differentiation, in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) with homologous recombination. Both homo- and hetero-inserted clones were efficiently obtained through a simple selection with a drug-resistant gene. The insertion of TRE-CMV promoter disrupted endogenous Flk1 expression, resulting in null mutation in homo-inserted clones. When the inserted TRE-CMV promoter was activated with doxycycline (Dox) depletion, Flk1 expression was sufficiently recovered from the downstream genomic Flk1 gene. Whereas EC differentiation was almost completely perturbed in homo-inserted clones, Flk1 rescue with TRE-CMV promoter activation restored EC appearance, indicating that phenotypic changes in EC differentiation can be successfully reproduced with this knockout-rescue system. Thus, this promoter insertion strategy with CRISPR/Cas9 would be a novel attractive method for knockout-rescue experiments.	T Matsunaga|JK Yamashita
24459147	The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated (CRISPR-Cas) system is a prokaryotic defense mechanism against foreign genetic elements. A plethora of CRISPR-Cas versions exist, with more than 40 different Cas protein families and several different molecular approaches to fight the invading DNA. One of the key players in the system is the CRISPR-derived RNA (crRNA), which directs the invader-degrading Cas protein complex to the invader. The CRISPR-Cas types I and III use the Cas6 protein to generate mature crRNAs. Here, we show that the Cas6 protein is necessary for crRNA production but that additional Cas proteins that form a CRISPR-associated complex for antiviral defense (Cascade)-like complex are needed for crRNA stability in the CRISPR-Cas type I-B system in Haloferax volcanii in vivo. Deletion of the cas6 gene results in the loss of mature crRNAs and interference. However, cells that have the complete cas gene cluster (cas1-8b) removed and are transformed with the cas6 gene are not able to produce and stably maintain mature crRNAs. crRNA production and stability is rescued only if cas5, -6, and -7 are present. Mutational analysis of the cas6 gene reveals three amino acids (His-41, Gly-256, and Gly-258) that are essential for pre-crRNA cleavage, whereas the mutation of two amino acids (Ser-115 and Ser-224) leads to an increase of crRNA amounts. This is the first systematic in vivo analysis of Cas6 protein variants. In addition, we show that the H. volcanii I-B system contains a Cascade-like complex with a Cas7, Cas5, and Cas6 core that protects the crRNA.

24457913	The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated (Cas) system has recently been used to engineer genomes of various organisms, but surprisingly, not those of bacteriophages (phages). Here we present a method to genetically engineer the Escherichia coli phage T7 using the type I-E CRISPR-Cas system. T7 phage genome is edited by homologous recombination with a DNA sequence flanked by sequences homologous to the desired location. Non-edited genomes are targeted by the CRISPR-Cas system, thus enabling isolation of the desired recombinant phages. This method broadens CRISPR Cas-based editing to phages and uses a CRISPR-Cas type other than type II. The method may be adjusted to genetically engineer any bacteriophage genome.

24443494	Targeted genome modification technologies are key tools for functional genomics. The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated endonuclease Cas9 system (CRISPR/Cas9) is an emerging technology for targeted genome modification. The CRISPR/Cas9 system consists of a short guide RNA (gRNA), which specifies the target genome sequence, and the Cas9 protein, which has endonuclease activity. The CRISPR/Cas9 system has been applied to model animals and flowering plants, including rice, sorghum, wheat, tobacco and Arabidopsis. Here, we report the application of CRISPR/Cas9 to targeted mutagenesis in the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha L., which has emerged as a model species for studying land plant evolution. The U6 promoter of M. polymorpha was identified and cloned to express the gRNA. The target sequence of the gRNA was designed to disrupt the gene encoding auxin response factor 1 (ARF1) in M. polymorpha. Using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, we isolated stable mutants in the gametophyte generation of M. polymorpha. CRISPR/Cas9-based site-directed mutagenesis in vivo was achieved using either the Cauliflower mosaic virus 35S or M. polymorpha EF1α promoter to express Cas9. Isolated mutant individuals showing an auxin-resistant phenotype were not chimeric. Moreover, stable mutants were produced by asexual reproduction of T1 plants. Multiple arf1 alleles were easily established using CRIPSR/Cas9-based targeted mutagenesis. Our results provide a rapid and simple approach for molecular genetics in M. polymorpha, and raise the possibility that CRISPR/Cas9 may be applied to a wide variety of plant species.

24433295	Infection of Sulfolobus islandicus REY15A with mixtures of different Sulfolobus viruses, including STSV2, did not induce spacer acquisition by the host CRISPR immune system. However, coinfection with the tailed fusiform viruses SMV1 and STSV2 generated hyperactive spacer acquisition in both CRISPR loci, exclusively from STSV2, with the resultant loss of STSV2 but not SMV1. SMV1 was shown to activate adaptation while itself being resistant to CRISPR-mediated adaptation and DNA interference. Exceptionally, a single clone S-1 isolated from an SMV1 + STSV2-infected culture, that carried STSV2-specific spacers and had lost STSV2 but not SMV1, acquired spacers from SMV1. This effect was also reproducible on reinfecting wild-type host cells with a variant SMV1 isolated from the S-1 culture. The SMV1 variant lacked a virion protein ORF114 that was shown to bind DNA. This study also provided evidence for: (i) limits on the maximum sizes of CRISPR loci; (ii) spacer uptake strongly retarding growth of infected cultures; (iii) protospacer selection being essentially random and non-directional, and (iv) the reversible uptake of spacers from STSV2 and SMV1. A hypothesis is presented to explain the interactive conflicts between SMV1 and the host CRISPR immune system.	S Erdmann|S Le Moine Bauer|RA Garrett

24415952	The human bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes is emerging as a model organism to study RNA-mediated regulation in pathogenic bacteria. A class of non-coding RNAs called CRISPRs (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) has been described to confer bacterial resistance against invading bacteriophages and conjugative plasmids. CRISPR function relies on the activity of CRISPR associated (cas) genes that encode a large family of proteins with nuclease or helicase activities and DNA and RNA binding domains. Here, we characterized a CRISPR element (RliB) that is expressed and processed in the L. monocytogenes strain EGD-e, which is completely devoid of cas genes. Structural probing revealed that RliB has an unexpected secondary structure comprising basepair interactions between the repeats and the adjacent spacers in place of canonical hairpins formed by the palindromic repeats. Moreover, in contrast to other CRISPR-Cas systems identified in Listeria, RliB-CRISPR is ubiquitously present among Listeria genomes at the same genomic locus and is never associated with the cas genes. We showed that RliB-CRISPR is a substrate for the endogenously encoded polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) enzyme. The spacers of the different Listeria RliB-CRISPRs share many sequences with temperate and virulent phages. Furthermore, we show that a cas-less RliB-CRISPR lowers the acquisition frequency of a plasmid carrying the matching protospacer, provided that trans encoded cas genes of a second CRISPR-Cas system are present in the genome. Importantly, we show that PNPase is required for RliB-CRISPR mediated DNA interference. Altogether, our data reveal a yet undescribed CRISPR system whose both processing and activity depend on PNPase, highlighting a new and unexpected function for PNPase in "CRISPRology".

24409757	In survival competition with phage, bacteria and archaea gradually evolved the acquired immune system--Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR), presenting the trait of transcribing the crRNA and the CRISPR-associated protein (Cas) to silence or cleaving the foreign double-stranded DNA specifically. In recent years, strong interest arises in prokaryotes primitive immune system and many in-depth researches are going on. Recently, researchers successfully repurposed CRISPR as an RNA-guided platform for sequence-specific gene expression, which provides a simple approach for selectively perturbing gene expression on a genome-wide scale. It will undoubtedly bring genome engineering into a more convenient and accurate new era.	H Li|S Qiu|H Song
24373158	CRISPR/Cas9 uses a guide RNA (gRNA) molecule to execute sequence-specific DNA cleavage and it has been widely used for genome editing in many organisms. Modifications at either end of the gRNAs often render Cas9/gRNA inactive. So far, production of gRNA in vivo has only been achieved by using the U6 and U3 snRNA promoters. However, the U6 and U3 promoters have major limitations such as a lack of cell specificity and unsuitability for in vitro transcription. Here, we present a versatile method for efficiently producing gRNAs both in vitro and in vivo. We design an artificial gene named RGR that, once transcribed, generates an RNA molecule with ribozyme sequences at both ends of the designed gRNA. We show that the primary transcripts of RGR undergo self-catalyzed cleavage to generate the desired gRNA, which can efficiently guide sequence-specific cleavage of DNA targets both in vitro and in yeast. RGR can be transcribed from any promoters and thus allows for cell- and tissue-specific genome editing if appropriate promoters are chosen. Detecting mutations generated by CRISPR is often achieved by enzyme digestions, which are not very compatible with high-throughput analysis. Our system allows for the use of universal primers to produce any gRNAs in vitro, which can then be used with Cas9 protein to detect mutations caused by the gRNAs/CRISPR. In conclusion, we provide a versatile method for generating targeted mutations in specific cells and tissues, and for efficiently detecting the mutations generated.	Y Gao|Y Zhao

Recently, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated endonucleases have been used as an effective tool for precise and multiplex genome editing in mice and rats. In this review, the advantages and disadvantages of these site-specific nuclease technologies for genetic analysis and manipulation in rats are discussed.	T Mashimo

24360272	The spatiotemporal organization and dynamics of chromatin play critical roles in regulating genome function. However, visualizing specific, endogenous genomic loci remains challenging in living cells. Here, we demonstrate such an imaging technique by repurposing the bacterial CRISPR/Cas system. Using an EGFP-tagged endonuclease-deficient Cas9 protein and a structurally optimized small guide (sg) RNA, we show robust imaging of repetitive elements in telomeres and coding genes in living cells. Furthermore, an array of sgRNAs tiling along the target locus enables the visualization of nonrepetitive genomic sequences. Using this method, we have studied telomere dynamics during elongation or disruption, the subnuclear localization of the MUC4 loci, the cohesion of replicated MUC4 loci on sister chromatids, and their dynamic behaviors during mitosis. This CRISPR imaging tool has potential to significantly improve the capacity to study the conformation and dynamics of native chromosomes in living human cells.

24341328	The Streptococcus Anginosus Group (SAG) represents three closely related species of the viridans group streptococci recognized as commensal bacteria of the oral, gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts. The SAG also cause severe invasive infections, and are pathogens during cystic fibrosis (CF) pulmonary exacerbation. Little genomic information or description of virulence mechanisms is currently available for SAG. We conducted intra and inter species whole-genome comparative analyses with 59 publically available Streptococcus genomes and seven in-house closed high quality finished SAG genomes; S. constellatus (3), S. intermedius (2), and S. anginosus (2). For each SAG species, we sequenced at least one numerically dominant strain from CF airways recovered during acute exacerbation and an invasive, non-lung isolate. We also evaluated microevolution that occurred within two isolates that were cultured from one individual one year apart.	The SAG genomes were most closely related to S. gordonii and S. sanguinis, based on shared orthologs and harbor a similar number of proteins within each COG category as other Streptococcus species. Numerous characterized streptococcus virulence factor homologs were identified within the SAG genomes including; adherence, invasion, spreading factors, LPxTG cell wall proteins, and two component histidine kinases known to be involved in virulence gene regulation. Mobile elements, primarily integrative conjugative elements and bacteriophage, account for greater than 10% of the SAG genomes. S. anginosus was the most variable species sequenced in this study, yielding both the smallest and the largest SAG genomes containing multiple genomic rearrangements, insertions and deletions. In contrast, within the S. constellatus and S. intermedius species, there was extensive continuous synteny, with only slight differences in genome size between strains. Within S. constellatus we were able to determine important SNPs and changes in VNTR numbers that occurred over the course of one year.	The comparative genomic analysis of the SAG clarifies the phylogenetics of these bacteria and supports the distinct species classification. Numerous potential virulence determinants were identified and provide a foundation for further studies into SAG pathogenesis. Furthermore, the data may be used to enable the development of rapid diagnostic assays and therapeutics for these pathogens.

24336571	The simplicity of programming the CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-associated nuclease Cas9 to modify specific genomic loci suggests a new way to interrogate gene function on a genome-wide scale. We show that lentiviral delivery of a genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 knockout (GeCKO) library targeting 18,080 genes with 64,751 unique guide sequences enables both negative and positive selection screening in human cells. First, we used the GeCKO library to identify genes essential for cell viability in cancer and pluripotent stem cells. Next, in a melanoma model, we screened for genes whose loss is involved in resistance to vemurafenib, a therapeutic RAF inhibitor. Our highest-ranking candidates include previously validated genes NF1 and MED12, as well as novel hits NF2, CUL3, TADA2B, and TADA1. We observe a high level of consistency between independent guide RNAs targeting the same gene and a high rate of hit confirmation, demonstrating the promise of genome-scale screening with Cas9.

24336569	The bacterial clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 system for genome editing has greatly expanded the toolbox for mammalian genetics, enabling the rapid generation of isogenic cell lines and mice with modified alleles. Here, we describe a pooled, loss-of-function genetic screening approach suitable for both positive and negative selection that uses a genome-scale lentiviral single-guide RNA (sgRNA) library. sgRNA expression cassettes were stably integrated into the genome, which enabled a complex mutant pool to be tracked by massively parallel sequencing. We used a library containing 73,000 sgRNAs to generate knockout collections and performed screens in two human cell lines. A screen for resistance to the nucleotide analog 6-thioguanine identified all expected members of the DNA mismatch repair pathway, whereas another for the DNA topoisomerase II (TOP2A) poison etoposide identified TOP2A, as expected, and also cyclin-dependent kinase 6, CDK6. A negative selection screen for essential genes identified numerous gene sets corresponding to fundamental processes. Last, we show that sgRNA efficiency is associated with specific sequence motifs, enabling the prediction of more effective sgRNAs. Collectively, these results establish Cas9/sgRNA screens as a powerful tool for systematic genetic analysis in mammalian cells.	T Wang|JJ Wei|DM Sabatini|ES Lander
24334663	Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) strains (n = 194) representing 43 serotypes and E. coli K-12 were examined for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) arrays to study genetic relatedness among STEC serotypes. A subset of the strains (n = 81) was further analyzed for subtype I-E cas and virulence genes to determine a possible association of CRISPR elements with potential virulence. Four types of CRISPR arrays were identified. CRISPR1 and CRISPR2 were present in all strains tested; 1 strain also had both CRISPR3 and CRISPR4, whereas 193 strains displayed a short, combined array, CRISPR3-4. A total of 3,353 spacers were identified, representing 528 distinct spacers. The average length of a spacer was 32 bp. Approximately one-half of the spacers (54%) were unique and found mostly in strains of less common serotypes. Overall, CRISPR spacer contents correlated well with STEC serotypes, and identical arrays were shared between strains with the same H type (O26:H11, O103:H11, and O111:H11). There was no association identified between the presence of subtype I-E cas and virulence genes, but the total number of spacers had a negative correlation with potential pathogenicity (P < 0.05). Fewer spacers were found in strains that had a greater probability of causing outbreaks and disease than in those with lower virulence potential (P < 0.05). The relationship between the CRISPR-cas system and potential virulence needs to be determined on a broader scale, and the biological link will need to be established.

24323919	The Cas9 endonuclease is the central component of the Type II CRISPR/Cas system, a prokaryotic adaptive restriction system against invading nucleic acids, such as those originating from bacteriophages and plasmids. Recently, this RNA-directed DNA endonuclease has been harnessed to target DNA sequences of interest. Here, we review the development of Cas9 as an important tool to not only edit the genomes of a number of different prokaryotic and eukaryotic species, but also as an efficient system for site-specific transcriptional repression or activation. Additionally, a specific Cas9 protein has been observed to target an RNA substrate, suggesting that Cas9 may have the ability to be programmed to target RNA as well. Cas proteins from other CRISPR/Cas subtypes may also be exploited in this regard. Thus, CRISPR/Cas systems represent an effective and versatile biotechnological tool, which will have significant impact on future advancements in genome engineering.	TR Sampson|DS Weiss
24315440	The CRISPR-Cas9 system has been employed to generate mutant alleles in a range of different organisms. However, so far there have not been reports of use of this system for efficient correction of a genetic disease. Here we show that mice with a dominant mutation in Crygc gene that causes cataracts could be rescued by coinjection into zygotes of Cas9 mRNA and a single-guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting the mutant allele. Correction occurred via homology-directed repair (HDR) based on an exogenously supplied oligonucleotide or the endogenous WT allele, with only rare evidence of off-target modifications. The resulting mice were fertile and able to transmit the corrected allele to their progeny. Thus, our study provides proof of principle for use of the CRISPR-Cas9 system to correct genetic disease.

24315439	Single murine and human intestinal stem cells can be expanded in culture over long time periods as genetically and phenotypically stable epithelial organoids. Increased cAMP levels induce rapid swelling of such organoids by opening the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductor receptor (CFTR). This response is lost in organoids derived from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Here we use the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system to correct the CFTR locus by homologous recombination in cultured intestinal stem cells of CF patients. The corrected allele is expressed and fully functional as measured in clonally expanded organoids. This study provides proof of concept for gene correction by homologous recombination in primary adult stem cells derived from patients with a single-gene hereditary defect.

24305178	The establishment of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and gene targeting technologies in mice has revolutionised the field of genetics. The relative ease with which genes can be knocked out, and exogenous sequences introduced, has allowed the mouse to become the prime model for deciphering the genetic code. Not surprisingly, the lack of authentic ESCs has hampered the livestock genetics field and has forced animal scientists into adapting alternative technologies for genetic engineering. The recent discovery of the creation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by upregulation of a handful of reprogramming genes has offered renewed enthusiasm to animal geneticists. However, much like ESCs, establishing authentic iPSCs from the domestic animals is still beset with problems, including (but not limited to) the persistent expression of reprogramming genes and the lack of proven potential for differentiation into target cell types both in vitro and in vivo. Site-specific nucleases comprised of zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and clustered regulated interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) emerged as powerful genetic tools for precisely editing the genome, usurping the need for ESC-based genetic modifications even in the mouse. In this article, in the aftermath of these powerful genome editing technologies, the role of pluripotent stem cells in livestock genetics is discussed.	KE Park|BP Telugu
24298059	RNAi combined with next-generation sequencing has proven to be a powerful and cost-effective genetic screening platform in mammalian cells. Still, this technology has its limitations and is incompatible with in situ mutagenesis screens on a genome-wide scale. Using p53 as a proof-of-principle target, we readapted the CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas9 (CRISPR associated 9) genome-editing system to demonstrate the feasibility of this methodology for targeted gene disruption positive selection assays. By using novel "all-in-one" lentiviral and retroviral delivery vectors heterologously expressing both a codon-optimized Cas9 and its synthetic guide RNA (sgRNA), we show robust selection for the CRISPR-modified Trp53 locus following drug treatment. Furthermore, by linking Cas9 expression to GFP fluorescence, we use an "all-in-one" system to track disrupted Trp53 in chemoresistant lymphomas in the Eμ-myc mouse model. Deep sequencing analysis of the tumor-derived endogenous Cas9-modified Trp53 locus revealed a wide spectrum of mutants that were enriched with seemingly limited off-target effects. Taken together, these results establish Cas9 genome editing as a powerful and practical approach for positive in situ genetic screens.

24284874	Despite the great success of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in ameliorating the course of HIV infection, alternative therapeutic approaches are being pursued because of practical problems associated with life-long therapy. The eradication of HIV in the so-called "Berlin patient" who received a bone marrow transplant from a CCR5-negative donor has rekindled interest in genome engineering strategies to achieve the same effect. Precise gene editing within the cells is now a realistic possibility with recent advances in understanding the DNA repair mechanisms, DNA interaction with transcription factors and bacterial defense mechanisms. Within the past few years, four novel technologies have emerged that can be engineered for recognition of specific DNA target sequences to enable site-specific gene editing: Homing Endonuclease, ZFN, TALEN, and CRISPR/Cas9 system. The most recent CRISPR/Cas9 system uses a short stretch of complementary RNA bound to Cas9 nuclease to recognize and cleave target DNA, as opposed to the previous technologies that use DNA binding motifs of either zinc finger proteins or transcription activator-like effector molecules fused to an endonuclease to mediate sequence-specific DNA cleavage. Unlike RNA interference, which requires the continued presence of effector moieties to maintain gene silencing, the newer technologies allow permanent disruption of the targeted gene after a single treatment. Here, we review the applications, limitations and future prospects of novel gene-editing strategies for use as HIV therapy.	N Manjunath|G Yi|Y Dang|P Shankar
24284873	CRISPR/Cas mediated genome editing has been successfully demonstrated in mammalian cells and further applications for generating mutant mice were reported by injecting humanized Cas9 (hCas) mRNA and single guide RNA into fertilized eggs. Here we inject the circular plasmids expressing hCas9 and sgRNA into mouse zygotes and obtained mutant mice within a month. When we targeted the Cetn1 locus, 58.8% (10/17) of the pups carried the mutations and six of them were homozygously mutated. Co-injection of the plasmids targeting different loci resulted in the successful removal of the flanked region in two out of three mutant pups. The efficient mutagenesis was also observed at the Prm1 locus. Among the 46 offspring carrying CRISPR/Cas plasmid mediated mutations, only two of them carried the hCas9 transgene. The pronuclear injection of circular plasmid expressing hCas9/sgRNA complex is a rapid, simple, and reproducible method for targeted mutagenesis.

24277082	Recent advances in genome engineering indicate that innovative crops developed by targeted genome modification (TGM) using site-specific nucleases (SSNs) have the potential to avoid the regulatory issues raised by genetically modified organisms. These powerful SSNs tools, comprising zinc-finger nucleases, transcription activator-like effector nucleases, and clustered regulatory interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated systems, enable precise genome engineering by introducing DNA double-strand breaks that subsequently trigger DNA repair pathways involving either non-homologous end-joining or homologous recombination. Here, we review developments in genome-editing tools, summarize their applications in crop organisms, and discuss future prospects. We also highlight the ability of these tools to create non-transgenic TGM plants for next-generation crop breeding.	K Chen|C Gao
24274754	RNase III is a global regulator of gene expression in Escherichia coli that is instrumental in the maturation of ribosomal and other structural RNAs. We examine here how RNase III itself is regulated in response to growth and other environmental changes encountered by the cell and how, by binding or processing double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) intermediates, RNase III controls the expression of genes. Recent insight into the mechanism of dsRNA binding and processing, gained from structural studies of RNase III, is reviewed. Structural studies also reveal new cleavage sites in the enzyme that can generate longer 3' overhangs.	DL Court|J Gan|YH Liang|GX Shaw|JE Tropea|N Costantino|DS Waugh|X Ji
24274039	Gene regulatory processes are largely resulting from binding of transcription factors to specific genomic targets. Leucine-responsive Regulatory Protein (Lrp) is a prevalent transcription factor family in prokaryotes, however, little information is available on biological functions of these proteins in archaea. Here, we study genome-wide binding of the Lrp-like transcription factor Ss-LrpB from Sulfolobus solfataricus.	Chromatin immunoprecipitation in combination with DNA microarray analysis (ChIP-chip) has revealed that Ss-LrpB interacts with 36 additional loci besides the four previously identified local targets. Only a subset of the newly identified binding targets, concentrated in a highly variable IS-dense genomic region, is also bound in vitro by pure Ss-LrpB. There is no clear relationship between the in vitro measured DNA-binding specificity of Ss-LrpB and the in vivo association suggesting a limited permissivity of the crenarchaeal chromatin for transcription factor binding. Of 37 identified binding regions, 29 are co-bound by LysM, another Lrp-like transcription factor in S. solfataricus. Comparative gene expression analysis in an Ss-lrpB mutant strain shows no significant Ss-LrpB-mediated regulation for most targeted genes, with exception of the CRISPR B cluster, which is activated by Ss-LrpB through binding to a specific motif in the leader region.	The genome-wide binding profile presented here implies that Ss-LrpB is associated at additional genomic binding sites besides the local gene targets, but acts as a specific transcription regulator in the tested growth conditions. Moreover, we have provided evidence that two Lrp-like transcription factors in S. solfataricus, Ss-LrpB and LysM, interact in vivo.

24271175	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) in combination with associated sequences (cas) constitute the CRISPR-Cas immune system, which uptakes DNA from invasive genetic elements as novel "spacers" that provide a genetic record of immunization events. We investigated the potential of CRISPR-based genotyping of Lactobacillus buchneri, a species relevant for commercial silage, bioethanol, and vegetable fermentations. Upon investigating the occurrence and diversity of CRISPR-Cas systems in Lactobacillus buchneri genomes, we observed a ubiquitous occurrence of CRISPR arrays containing a 36-nucleotide (nt) type II-A CRISPR locus adjacent to four cas genes, including the universal cas1 and cas2 genes and the type II signature gene cas9. Comparative analysis of CRISPR spacer content in 26 L. buchneri pickle fermentation isolates associated with spoilage revealed 10 unique locus genotypes that contained between 9 and 29 variable spacers. We observed a set of conserved spacers at the ancestral end, reflecting a common origin, as well as leader-end polymorphisms, reflecting recent divergence. Some of these spacers showed perfect identity with phage sequences, and many spacers showed homology to Lactobacillus plasmid sequences. Following a comparative analysis of sequences immediately flanking protospacers that matched CRISPR spacers, we identified a novel putative protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM), 5'-AAAA-3'. Overall, these findings suggest that type II-A CRISPR-Cas systems are valuable for genotyping of L. buchneri.	AE Briner|R Barrangou
24265226	The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas system mediates adaptive immunity against foreign nucleic acids in prokaryotes. However, efficient adaptation of a native CRISPR to purified viruses has only been observed for the type II-A system from a Streptococcus thermophilus industry strain, and rarely reported for laboratory strains. Here, we provide a second native system showing efficient adaptation. Infected by a newly isolated virus HHPV-2, Haloarcula hispanica type I-B CRISPR system acquired spacers discriminatively from viral sequences. Unexpectedly, in addition to Cas1, Cas2 and Cas4, this process also requires Cas3 and at least partial Cascade proteins, which are involved in interference and/or CRISPR RNA maturation. Intriguingly, a preexisting spacer partially matching a viral sequence is also required, and spacer acquisition from upstream and downstream sequences of its target sequence (i.e. priming protospacer) shows different strand bias. These evidences strongly indicate that adaptation in this system strictly requires a priming process. This requirement, if validated also true for other CRISPR systems as implied by our bioinformatic analysis, may help to explain failures to observe efficient adaptation to purified viruses in many laboratory strains, and the discrimination mechanism at the adaptation level that has confused scientists for years.

24259713	Bacterial viruses (phages) are the most abundant biological group on Earth and are more genetically diverse than their bacterial prey/hosts. To characterize their role as agents shaping gut microbial community structure, adult germ-free mice were colonized with a consortium of 15 sequenced human bacterial symbionts, 13 of which harbored one or more predicted prophages. One member, Bacteroides cellulosilyticus WH2, was represented by a library of isogenic transposon mutants that covered 90% of its genes. Once assembled, the community was subjected to a staged phage attack with a pool of live or heat-killed virus-like particles (VLPs) purified from the fecal microbiota of five healthy humans. Shotgun sequencing of DNA from the input pooled VLP preparation plus shotgun sequencing of gut microbiota samples and purified fecal VLPs from the gnotobiotic mice revealed a reproducible nonsimultaneous pattern of attack extending over a 25-d period that involved five phages, none described previously. This system allowed us to (i) correlate increases in specific phages present in the pooled VLPs with reductions in the representation of particular bacterial taxa, (ii) provide evidence that phage resistance occurred because of ecological or epigenetic factors, (iii) track the origin of each of the five phages among the five human donors plus the extent of their genome variation between and within recipient mice, and (iv) establish the dramatic in vivo fitness advantage that a locus within a B. cellulosilyticus prophage confers upon its host. Together, these results provide a defined community-wide view of phage-bacterial host dynamics in the gut.	A Reyes|M Wu|NP McNulty|FL Rohwer|JI Gordon
24256237	In bacteria and archaea, RNA-Seq deep sequencing methodology allows for the detection of abundance and processing sites of the small RNAs that comprise a CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) RNome. Comparative analyses of these CRISPR RNome sets highlight conserved patterns that include the gradual decline of CRISPR RNA abundance from the leader-proximal to the leader-distal end. In the present review, we discuss exceptions to these patterns that indicate the extensive impact of individual spacer sequences on CRISPR array transcription and RNA maturation. Spacer sequences can contain promoter and terminator elements and can promote the formation of CRISPR RNA-anti-CRISPR RNA duplexes. In addition, potential RNA duplex formation with host tRNA was observed. These factors can influence the functionality of CRISPR-Cas (CRISPR-associated) systems and need to be considered in the design of synthetic CRISPR arrays.	J Zoephel|L Randau
24256236	Organisms of the crenarchaeal order Sulfolobales carry complex CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) adaptive immune systems. These systems are modular and show extensive structural and functional diversity, especially in their interference complexes. The primary targets are an exceptional range of diverse viruses, many of which propagate stably within cells and follow lytic life cycles without producing cell lysis. These properties are consistent with the difficulty of activating CRISPR spacer uptake in the laboratory, but appear to conflict with the high complexity and diversity of the CRISPR immune systems that are found among the Sulfolobales. In the present article, we re-examine the first successful induction of archaeal spacer acquisition in our laboratory that occurred exclusively for the conjugative plasmid pMGB1 in Sulfolobus solfataricus P2 that was co-infected with the virus SMV1 (Sulfolobus monocaudavirus 1). Although we reaffirm that protospacer selection is essentially a random process with respect to the pMGB1 genome, we identified single spacer sequences specific for each of CRISPR loci C, D and E that, exceptionally, occurred in many sequenced clones. Moreover, the same sequence was reproducibly acquired for a given locus in independent experiments, consistent with it being the first protospacer to be selected. There was also a small protospacer bias (1.6:1) to the antisense strand of protein genes. In addition, new experiments demonstrated that spacer acquisition in the previously inactive CRISPR locus A could be induced on freeze-thawing of the infected cells, suggesting that environmental stress can facilitate activation. Coincidentally with spacer acquisition, a mobile OrfB element was deleted from pMGB1, suggesting that interplay can occur between spacer acquisition and transposition.	S Erdmann|SA Shah|RA Garrett
24256234	The host-restricted bacterium Streptococcus equi is the causative agent of equine strangles, the most frequently diagnosed infectious disease of horses worldwide. The disease is characterized by abscessation of the lymph nodes of the head and neck, leading to significant welfare and economic cost. S. equi is believed to have evolved from an ancestral strain of Streptococcus zooepidemicus, an opportunistic pathogen of horses and other animals. Comparison of the genome of S. equi strain 4047 with those of S. zooepidemicus identified examples of gene loss due to mutation and deletion, and gene gain through the acquisition of mobile genetic elements that have probably shaped the pathogenic specialization of S. equi. In particular, deletion of the CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) locus in the ancestor of S. equi may have predisposed the bacterium to acquire and incorporate new genetic material into its genome. These include four prophages and a novel integrative conjugative element. The virulence cargo carried by these mobile genetic elements is believed to have shaped the ability of S. equi to cause strangles. Further sequencing of S. zooepidemicus has highlighted the diversity of this opportunistic pathogen. Again, CRISPRs are postulated to influence evolution, balancing the need for gene gain over genome stability. Analysis of spacer sequences suggest that these pathogens may be susceptible to a limited range of phages and provide further evidence of cross-species exchange of genetic material among Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus dysgalactiae.

24256233	Host-pathogen co-evolution is a significant force which shapes the ecology and evolution of all types of organisms, and such interactions are driven by resistance and immunity mechanisms of the host. Diversity of resistance and immunity can affect the co-evolutionary trajectory of both host and pathogen. The microbial CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-Cas (CRISPR-associated) system is one host immunity mechanism which offers a tractable model for examining the dynamics of diversity in an immune system. In the present article, we review CRISPR variation observed in a variety of natural populations, examine the forces which can push CRISPRs towards high or low diversity, and investigate the consequences of various levels of diversity on microbial populations.	WE England|RJ Whitaker
24256232	The CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) system is an adaptive immune system that targets viruses and other mobile genetic elements in bacteria and archaea. Cells store information of past infections in their genome in repeat-spacer arrays. After transcription, these arrays are processed into unit-length crRNA (CRISPR RNA) that is loaded into effector complexes encoded by Cas (CRISPR-associated) genes. CRISPR-Cas complexes target invading nucleic acid for degradation. CRISPR effector complexes have been classified into three main types (I-III). Type III effector complexes share the Cas10 subunit. In the present paper, we discuss the structures of the two Type III effector complexes from Sulfolobus solfataricus, SsoCSM (subtype III-A) and SsoCMR (subtype III-B), obtained by electron microscopy and single particle analysis. We also compare these structures with Cascade (CRISPR-associated complex for antiviral defence) and with the RecA nucleoprotein.	G Cannone|M Webber-Birungi|L Spagnolo
24256229	The CRISPRs (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) and their associated Cas (CRISPR-associated) proteins are a prokaryotic adaptive defence system against foreign nucleic acids. The CRISPR array comprises short repeats flanking short segments, called 'spacers', which are derived from foreign nucleic acids. The process of spacer insertion into the CRISPR array is termed 'adaptation'. Adaptation allows the system to rapidly evolve against emerging threats. In the present article, we review the most recent studies on the adaptation process, and focus primarily on the subtype I-E CRISPR-Cas system of Escherichia coli.	R Kiro|MG Goren|I Yosef|U Qimron
24256227	The ternary Cas9-crRNA-tracrRNA complex (Cas9t) of the Type II CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-Cas (CRISPR-associated) system functions as an Mg2+-dependent RNA-directed DNA endonuclease that locates its DNA target guided by the crRNA (CRISPR RNA) in the tracrRNA-crRNA structure and introduces a double-strand break at a specific site in DNA. The simple modular organization of Cas9t, where specificity for the DNA target is encoded by a small crRNA and the cleavage reaction is executed by the Cas9 endonuclease, provides a versatile platform for the engineering of universal RNA-directed DNA endonucleases. By altering the crRNA sequence within the Cas9t complex, programmable endonucleases can be designed for both in vitro and in vivo applications. Cas9t has been recently employed as a gene-editing tool in various eukaryotic cell types. Using Streptococcus thermophilus Cas9t as a model system, we demonstrate the feasibility of Cas9t as a programmable molecular tool for in vitro DNA manipulations.	T Karvelis|G Gasiunas|V Siksnys
24256225	CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) together with CAS (RISPR-associated) genes form the CRISPR-Cas immune system, which provides sequence-specific adaptive immunity against foreign genetic elements in bacteria and archaea. Immunity is acquired by the integration of short stretches of invasive DNA as novel 'spacers' into CRISPR loci. Subsequently, these immune markers are transcribed and generate small non-coding interfering RNAs that specifically guide nucleases for sequence-specific cleavage of complementary sequences. Among the four CRISPR-Cas systems present in Streptococcus thermophilus, CRISPR1 and CRISPR3 have the ability to readily acquire new spacers following bacteriophage or plasmid exposure. In order to investigate the impact of building CRISPR-encoded immunity on the host chromosome, we determined the genome sequence of a BIM (bacteriophage-insensitive mutant) derived from the DGCC7710 model organism, after four consecutive rounds of bacteriophage challenge. As expected, active CRISPR loci evolved via polarized addition of several novel spacers following exposure to bacteriophages. Although analysis of the draft genome sequence revealed a variety of SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) and INDELs (insertions/deletions), most of the in silico differences were not validated by Sanger re-sequencing. In addition, two SNPs and two small INDELs were identified and tracked in the intermediate variants. Overall, building CRISPR-encoded immunity does not significantly affect the genome, which allows the maintenance of important functional properties in isogenic CRISPR mutants. This is critical for the development and formulation of sustainable and robust next-generation starter cultures with increased industrial lifespans.

24253447	RNA-guided endonucleases (RGENs), derived from the prokaryotic Type II CRISPR-Cas system, enable targeted genome modification in cells and organisms. Here we describe the establishment of gene-knockout mice and zebrafish by the injection of RGENs as Cas9 protein:guide RNA complexes or Cas9 mRNA plus guide RNA into one-cell-stage embryos of both species. RGENs efficiently generated germline transmittable mutations in up to 93% of newborn mice with minimal toxicity. RGEN-induced mutations in the mouse Prkdc gene that encodes an enzyme critical for DNA double-strand break repair resulted in immunodeficiency both in F₀ and F₁ mice. We propose that RGEN-mediated mutagenesis in animals will greatly expedite the creation of genetically engineered model organisms, accelerating functional genomic research.

24199189	Cas9/CRISPR has been reported to efficiently induce targeted gene disruption and homologous recombination in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Thus, we developed a Guide RNA Sequence Design Platform for the Cas9/CRISPR silencing system for model organisms. The platform is easy to use for gRNA design with input query sequences. It finds potential targets by PAM and ranks them according to factors including uniqueness, SNP, RNA secondary structure, and AT content. The platform allows users to upload and share their experimental results. In addition, most guide RNA sequences from published papers have been put into our database.	M Ma|AY Ye|W Zheng|L Kong
24179142	Sequence-specific nucleases like TALENs and the CRISPR/Cas9 system have greatly expanded the genome editing possibilities in model organisms such as zebrafish. Both systems have recently been used to create knock-out alleles with great efficiency, and TALENs have also been successfully employed in knock-in of DNA cassettes at defined loci via homologous recombination (HR). Here we report CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-in of DNA cassettes into the zebrafish genome at a very high rate by homology-independent double-strand break (DSB) repair pathways. After co-injection of a donor plasmid with a short guide RNA (sgRNA) and Cas9 nuclease mRNA, concurrent cleavage of donor plasmid DNA and the selected chromosomal integration site resulted in efficient targeted integration of donor DNA. We successfully employed this approach to convert eGFP into Gal4 transgenic lines, and the same plasmids and sgRNAs can be applied in any species where eGFP lines were generated as part of enhancer and gene trap screens. In addition, we show the possibility of easily targeting DNA integration at endogenous loci, thus greatly facilitating the creation of reporter and loss-of-function alleles. Due to its simplicity, flexibility, and very high efficiency, our method greatly expands the repertoire for genome editing in zebrafish and can be readily adapted to many other organisms.

24171432	Cas4 proteins, a core protein family associated with the microbial system of adaptive immunity CRISPR, are predicted to function in the adaptation step of the CRISPR mechanism. Here we show that the Cas4 protein SSO0001 from the archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus has metal-dependent endonuclease and 5'→3' exonuclease activities against single-stranded DNA, as well as ATP-independent DNA unwinding activity toward double-stranded DNA. The crystal structure of SSO0001 revealed a decameric toroid formed by five dimers with each protomer containing one [4Fe-4S] cluster and one Mn(2+) ion bound in the active site located inside the internal tunnel. The conserved RecB motif and four Cys residues are important for DNA binding and cleavage activities, whereas DNA unwinding depends on several residues located near the [4Fe-4S] cluster. Our results suggest that Cas4 proteins might contribute to the addition of novel CRISPR spacers through the formation of 3'-DNA overhangs and to the degradation of foreign DNA.

24162568	Rapid and accurate strain identification is paramount in the battle against microbial outbreaks, and several subtyping approaches have been developed. One such method uses clustered regular interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs), DNA repeat elements that are present in approximately half of all bacteria. Though their signature function is as an adaptive immune system against invading DNA such as bacteriophages and plasmids, CRISPRs also provide an excellent framework for pathogen tracking and evolutionary studies. Analysis of the spacer DNA sequences that reside between the repeats has been tremendously useful for bacterial subtyping during molecular epidemiological investigations. Subtyping, or strain identification, using CRISPRs has been employed in diverse Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Salmonella enterica, and the plant pathogen Erwinia amylovora. This review discusses the several ways in which CRISPR sequences are exploited for subtyping. This includes the well-established spoligotyping methodologies that have been used for 2 decades to type Mycobacterium species, as well as in-depth consideration of newer, higher-throughput CRISPR-based protocols.

24158624	The enteric pathogen Salmonella enterica is one of the leading causes of foodborne illness in the world. The species is extremely diverse, containing more than 2,500 named serovars that are designated for their unique antigen characters and pathogenicity profiles-some are known to be virulent pathogens, while others are not. Questions regarding the evolution of pathogenicity, significance of antigen characters, diversity of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) loci, among others, will remain elusive until a strong evolutionary framework is established. We present the first large-scale S. enterica subsp. enterica phylogeny inferred from a new reference-free k-mer approach of gathering single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from whole genomes. The phylogeny of 156 isolates representing 78 serovars (102 were newly sequenced) reveals two major lineages, each with many strongly supported sublineages. One of these lineages is the S. Typhi group; well nested within the phylogeny. Lineage-through-time analyses suggest there have been two instances of accelerated rates of diversification within the subspecies. We also found that antigen characters and CRISPR loci reveal different evolutionary patterns than that of the phylogeny, suggesting that a horizontal gene transfer or possibly a shared environmental acquisition might have influenced the present character distribution. Our study also shows the ability to extract reference-free SNPs from a large set of genomes and then to use these SNPs for phylogenetic reconstruction. This automated, annotation-free approach is an important step forward for bacterial disease tracking and in efficiently elucidating the evolutionary history of highly clonal organisms.

24157548	Targeted nucleases are powerful tools for mediating genome alteration with high precision. The RNA-guided Cas9 nuclease from the microbial clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) adaptive immune system can be used to facilitate efficient genome engineering in eukaryotic cells by simply specifying a 20-nt targeting sequence within its guide RNA. Here we describe a set of tools for Cas9-mediated genome editing via nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology-directed repair (HDR) in mammalian cells, as well as generation of modified cell lines for downstream functional studies. To minimize off-target cleavage, we further describe a double-nicking strategy using the Cas9 nickase mutant with paired guide RNAs. This protocol provides experimentally derived guidelines for the selection of target sites, evaluation of cleavage efficiency and analysis of off-target activity. Beginning with target design, gene modifications can be achieved within as little as 1-2 weeks, and modified clonal cell lines can be derived within 2-3 weeks.

24154526	Gene targeting by 'ends-out' homologous recombination enables the deletion of genomic sequences and concurrent introduction of exogenous DNA with base-pair precision without sequence constraint. In Drosophila, this powerful technique has remained laborious and hence seldom implemented. We describe a targeting vector and protocols that achieve this at high frequency and with very few false positives in Drosophila, either with a two-generation crossing scheme or by direct injection in embryos. The frequency of injection-mediated gene targeting can be further increased with CRISPR-induced double-strand breaks within the region to be deleted, thus making homologous recombination almost as easy as conventional transgenesis. Our targeting vector replaces genomic sequences with a multifunctional fragment comprising an easy-to-select genetic marker, a fluorescent reporter, as well as an attP site, which acts as a landing platform for reintegration vectors. These vectors allow the insertion of a variety of transcription reporters or cDNAs to express tagged or mutant isoforms at endogenous levels. In addition, they pave the way for difficult experiments such as tissue-specific allele switching and functional analysis in post-mitotic or polyploid cells. Therefore, our method retains the advantages of homologous recombination while capitalising on the mutagenic power of CRISPR.	LA Baena-Lopez|C Alexandre|A Mitchell|L Pasakarnis|JP Vincent
24150936	In many bacteria and archaea, small RNAs derived from clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) associate with CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins to target foreign DNA for destruction. In Type I and III CRISPR/Cas systems, the Cas6 family of endoribonucleases generates functional CRISPR-derived RNAs by site-specific cleavage of repeat sequences in precursor transcripts. CRISPR repeats differ widely in both sequence and structure, with varying propensity to form hairpin folds immediately preceding the cleavage site. To investigate the evolution of distinct mechanisms for the recognition of diverse CRISPR repeats by Cas6 enzymes, we determined crystal structures of two Thermus thermophilus Cas6 enzymes both alone and bound to substrate and product RNAs. These structures show how the scaffold common to all Cas6 endonucleases has evolved two binding sites with distinct modes of RNA recognition: one specific for a hairpin fold and the other for a single-stranded 5'-terminal segment preceding the hairpin. These findings explain how divergent Cas6 enzymes have emerged to mediate highly selective pre-CRISPR-derived RNA processing across diverse CRISPR systems.	O Niewoehner|M Jinek|JA Doudna

24141137	The type II CRISPR/Cas9 system (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated) has recently emerged as an efficient and simple tool for site-specific engineering of eukaryotic genomes. To improve its applications in Drosophila genome engineering, we simplified the standard two-component CRISPR/Cas9 system by generating a stable transgenic fly line expressing the Cas9 endonuclease in the germline (Vasa-Cas9 line). By injecting vectors expressing engineered target-specific guide RNAs into Vasa-Cas9 fly embryos, mutations were generated from site-specific DNA cleavages and efficiently transmitted into progenies. Because Cas9 endonuclease is the universal component of the type II CRISPR/Cas9 system, site-specific genomic engineering based on this improved platform can be achieved with lower complexity and toxicity, greater consistency, and excellent versatility.

24136345	Sequence-specific control of gene expression on a genome-wide scale is an important approach for understanding gene functions and for engineering genetic regulatory systems. We have recently described an RNA-based method, CRISPR interference (CRISPRi), for targeted silencing of transcription in bacteria and human cells. The CRISPRi system is derived from the Streptococcus pyogenes CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats) pathway, requiring only the coexpression of a catalytically inactive Cas9 protein and a customizable single guide RNA (sgRNA). The Cas9-sgRNA complex binds to DNA elements complementary to the sgRNA and causes a steric block that halts transcript elongation by RNA polymerase, resulting in the repression of the target gene. Here we provide a protocol for the design, construction and expression of customized sgRNAs for transcriptional repression of any gene of interest. We also provide details for testing the repression activity of CRISPRi using quantitative fluorescence assays and native elongating transcript sequencing. CRISPRi provides a simplified approach for rapid gene repression within 1-2 weeks. The method can also be adapted for high-throughput interrogation of genome-wide gene functions and genetic interactions, thus providing a complementary approach to RNA interference, which can be used in a wider variety of organisms.

24123613	We have assessed the efficacy of the recently developed CRISPR/Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated) system for genome modification in the amphibian Xenopus tropicalis. As a model experiment, targeted mutations of the tyrosinase gene were verified, showing the expected albinism phenotype in injected embryos. We further tested this technology by interrupting the six3 gene, which is required for proper eye and brain formation. Expected eye and brain phenotypes were observed when inducing mutations in the six3 coding regions, as well as when deleting the gene promoter by dual targeting. We describe here a standardized protocol for genome editing using this system. This simple and fast method to edit the genome provides a powerful new reverse genetics tool for Xenopus researchers.

24123579	Gene inactivation is an important tool for correlation of phenotypic and genomic data, allowing researchers to infer normal gene function based on the phenotype when the gene is impaired. New and better approaches are needed to overcome the shortfalls of existing methods for any significant acceleration of scientific progress. We have adapted the CRISPR/Cas system for use in Xenopus tropicalis and report on the efficient creation of mutations in the gene encoding the enzyme tyrosinase, which is responsible for oculocutaneous albinism. Biallelic mutation of this gene was detected in the F0 generation, suggesting targeting efficiencies similar to that of TALENs. We also find that off-target mutagenesis seems to be negligible, and therefore, CRISPR/Cas may be a useful system for creating genome modifications in this important model organism.

24122057	The clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated protein (Cas) system has been used as an efficient tool for genome editing. We report the application of CRISPR-Cas-mediated genome editing to wheat (Triticum aestivum), the most important food crop plant with a very large and complex genome. The mutations were targeted in the inositol oxygenase (inox) and phytoene desaturase (pds) genes using cell suspension culture of wheat and in the pds gene in leaves of Nicotiana benthamiana. The expression of chimeric guide RNAs (cgRNA) targeting single and multiple sites resulted in indel mutations in all the tested samples. The expression of Cas9 or sgRNA alone did not cause any mutation. The expression of duplex cgRNA with Cas9 targeting two sites in the same gene resulted in deletion of DNA fragment between the targeted sequences. Multiplexing the cgRNA could target two genes at one time. Target specificity analysis of cgRNA showed that mismatches at the 3' end of the target site abolished the cleavage activity completely. The mismatches at the 5' end reduced cleavage, suggesting that the off target effects can be abolished in vivo by selecting target sites with unique sequences at 3' end. This approach provides a powerful method for genome engineering in plants.	SK Upadhyay|J Kumar|A Alok|R Tuli
24119404	Bacterial and archaeal clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) loci capture virus and plasmid sequences and use them to recognize and eliminate these invaders. CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) containing the acquired sequences are incorporated into effector complexes that destroy matching invader nucleic acids. The multicomponent Cmr effector complex cleaves RNA targets complementary to the crRNAs. Here, we report cryoelectron microscopy reconstruction of a functional Cmr complex bound with a target RNA at ~12 Å. Pairs of the Cmr4 and Cmr5 proteins form a helical core that is asymmetrically capped on each end by distinct pairs of the four remaining subunits: Cmr2 and Cmr3 at the conserved 5' crRNA tag sequence and Cmr1 and Cmr6 near the 3' end of the crRNA. The shape and organization of the RNA-targeting Cmr complex is strikingly similar to the DNA-targeting Cascade complex. Our results reveal a remarkably conserved architecture among very distantly related CRISPR-Cas complexes.	M Spilman|A Cocozaki|C Hale|Y Shao|N Ramia|R Terns|M Terns|H Li|S Stagg
24119403	The CRISPR-Cas system is a prokaryotic host defense system against genetic elements. The Type III-B CRISPR-Cas system of the bacterium Thermus thermophilus, the TtCmr complex, is composed of six different protein subunits (Cmr1-6) and one crRNA with a stoichiometry of Cmr112131445361:crRNA1. The TtCmr complex copurifies with crRNA species of 40 and 46 nt, originating from a distinct subset of CRISPR loci and spacers. The TtCmr complex cleaves the target RNA at multiple sites with 6 nt intervals via a 5' ruler mechanism. Electron microscopy revealed that the structure of TtCmr resembles a "sea worm" and is composed of a Cmr2-3 heterodimer "tail," a helical backbone of Cmr4 subunits capped by Cmr5 subunits, and a curled "head" containing Cmr1 and Cmr6. Despite having a backbone of only four Cmr4 subunits and being both longer and narrower, the overall architecture of TtCmr resembles that of Type I Cascade complexes.

24119402	The Clustered Regularly Interspaced Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) system is an adaptive immune system in prokaryotes. Interference complexes encoded by CRISPR-associated (cas) genes utilize small RNAs for homology-directed detection and subsequent degradation of invading genetic elements, and they have been classified into three main types (I-III). Type III complexes share the Cas10 subunit but are subclassifed as type IIIA (CSM) and type IIIB (CMR), depending on their specificity for DNA or RNA targets, respectively. The role of CSM in limiting the spread of conjugative plasmids in Staphylococcus epidermidis was first described in 2008. Here, we report a detailed investigation of the composition and structure of the CSM complex from the archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus, using a combination of electron microscopy, mass spectrometry, and deep sequencing. This reveals a three-dimensional model for the CSM complex that includes a helical component strikingly reminiscent of the backbone structure of the type I (Cascade) family.

24118239	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) are composed of numerous repeat-spacer units and are considered a prokaryotic defence system against foreign nucleic acids. Since antibiotic-resistant genes are frequently encoded in foreign nucleic acids, the aim of this study was to test whether erythromycin susceptibility in group A streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes) is associated with characteristics of CRISPR elements. Erythromycin susceptibility of 330 isolates collected between 1997 and 2003 was analysed. Among 29 emm types, emm12, emm75 and emm92 showed significant changes in erythromycin-resistance rates. By sequencing the spacers from two CRISPR loci, spacer contents in emm12, emm75 and emm92 strains were associated with erythromycin susceptibility. Strains with fewer spacers were more resistant to erythromycin. Moreover, in emm4 strains, which showed no significant change in their annual erythromycin-resistance rate, CRISPR type and number of spacers were not correlated with erythromycin susceptibility. These results highlight a novel association between CRISPR spacer content and erythromycin susceptibility in group A streptococcus.

24117801	Zebrafish has become a popular model organism to study human diseases. We will highlight the advantages and limitations of zebrafish as a model organism to study neurodegenerative diseases and introduce zinc finger nucleases, transcription activator-like effector nucleases, and the recently established clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat-associated system for genome editing. The efficiency of the novel genome editing tools now greatly facilitates knock-out and, importantly, also makes knock-in approaches feasible in zebrafish. Genome editing in zebrafish avoids unspecific phenotypes caused by off-target effects and toxicity as frequently seen in conventional knock-down approaches.	B Schmid|C Haass
24095303	Tailor-made nucleases for precise genome modification, such as zinc finger or TALE nucleases, currently represent the state-of-the-art for genome editing. These nucleases combine a programmable protein module which guides the enzyme to the target site with a nuclease domain which cuts DNA at the addressed site. Reprogramming of these nucleases to cut genomes at specific locations requires major protein engineering efforts. RNA-guided DNA endonuclease Cas9 of the type II (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat) CRISPR-Cas system uses CRISPR RNA (crRNA) as a guide to locate the DNA target and the Cas9 protein to cut DNA. Easy programmability of the Cas9 endonuclease using customizable RNAs brings unprecedented flexibility and versatility for targeted genome modification. We highlight the potential of the Cas9 RNA-guided DNA endonuclease as a novel tool for genome surgery, and discuss possible constraints and future prospects.	G Gasiunas|V Siksnys
24086164	The immune systems that protect organisms from infectious agents invariably have a cost for the host. In bacteria and archaea CRISPR-Cas loci can serve as adaptive immune systems that protect these microbes from infectiously transmitted DNAs. When those DNAs are borne by lytic viruses (phages), this protection can provide a considerable advantage. CRISPR-Cas immunity can also prevent cells from acquiring plasmids and free DNA bearing genes that increase their fitness. Here, we use a combination of experiments and mathematical-computer simulation models to explore this downside of CRISPR-Cas immunity and its implications for the maintenance of CRISPR-Cas loci in microbial populations. We analyzed the conjugational transfer of the staphylococcal plasmid pG0400 into Staphylococcus epidermidis RP62a recipients that bear a CRISPR-Cas locus targeting this plasmid. Contrary to what is anticipated for lytic phages, which evade CRISPR by mutations in the target region, the evasion of CRISPR immunity by plasmids occurs at the level of the host through loss of functional CRISPR-Cas immunity. The results of our experiments and models indicate that more than 10(-4) of the cells in CRISPR-Cas positive populations are defective or deleted for the CRISPR-Cas region and thereby able to receive and carry the plasmid. Most intriguingly, the loss of CRISPR function even by large deletions can have little or no fitness cost in vitro. These theoretical and experimental results can account for the considerable variation in the existence, number and function of CRISPR-Cas loci within and between bacterial species. We postulate that as a consequence of the opposing positive and negative selection for immunity, CRISPR-Cas systems are in a continuous state of flux. They are lost when they bear immunity to laterally transferred beneficial genes, re-acquired by horizontal gene transfer, and ascend in environments where phage are a major source of mortality.

24084724	Genome manipulation of human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells is essential to achieve their full potential as tools for regenerative medicine. To date, however, gene targeting in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) has proven to be extremely difficult. Recently, an efficient genome manipulation technology using the RNA-guided DNase Cas9, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) system, has been developed. Here we report the efficient generation of an iPS cell model for immunodeficiency, centromeric region instability, facial anomalies syndrome (ICF) syndrome using the CRISPR system. We obtained iPS cells with mutations in both alleles of DNA methyltransferase 3B (DNMT3B) in 63% of transfected clones. Our data suggest that the CRISPR system is highly efficient and useful for genome engineering of human iPS cells.	T Horii|D Tamura|S Morita|M Kimura|I Hatada
24076990	RNA-guided Cas9 nucleases derived from clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas systems have dramatically transformed our ability to edit the genomes of diverse organisms. We believe tools and techniques based on Cas9, a single unifying factor capable of colocalizing RNA, DNA and protein, will grant unprecedented control over cellular organization, regulation and behavior. Here we describe the Cas9 targeting methodology, detail current and prospective engineering advances and suggest potential applications ranging from basic science to the clinic.

24039596	Discriminating self and non-self is a universal requirement of immune systems. Adaptive immune systems in prokaryotes are centered around repetitive loci called CRISPRs (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat), into which invader DNA fragments are incorporated. CRISPR transcripts are processed into small RNAs that guide CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins to invading nucleic acids by complementary base pairing. However, to avoid autoimmunity it is essential that these RNA-guides exclusively target invading DNA and not complementary DNA sequences (i.e., self-sequences) located in the host's own CRISPR locus. Previous work on the Type III-A CRISPR system from Staphylococcus epidermidis has demonstrated that a portion of the CRISPR RNA-guide sequence is involved in self versus non-self discrimination. This self-avoidance mechanism relies on sensing base pairing between the RNA-guide and sequences flanking the target DNA. To determine if the RNA-guide participates in self versus non-self discrimination in the Type I-E system from Escherichia coli we altered base pairing potential between the RNA-guide and the flanks of DNA targets. Here we demonstrate that Type I-E systems discriminate self from non-self through a base pairing-independent mechanism that strictly relies on the recognition of four unchangeable PAM sequences. In addition, this work reveals that the first base pair between the guide RNA and the PAM nucleotide immediately flanking the target sequence can be disrupted without affecting the interference phenotype. Remarkably, this indicates that base pairing at this position is not involved in foreign DNA recognition. Results in this paper reveal that the Type I-E mechanism of avoiding self sequences and preventing autoimmunity is fundamentally different from that employed by Type III-A systems. We propose the exclusive targeting of PAM-flanked sequences to be termed a target versus non-target discrimination mechanism.

24021627	The hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus carries an extensive array of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) systems able to mediate DNA degradation of invading genetic elements when complementarity to the small CRISPR-derived (cr)RNAs is given. Studying virus defence in vivo with recombinant viral variants, we demonstrate here that an unexpectedly high number of mutations are tolerated between the CRISPR-derived guide RNAs (crRNAs) and their target sequences (protospacer). Up to 15 mismatches in the crRNA still led to ∼50% of DNA degradation, when these mutations were outside the 'seed' region. More than 15 mutations were necessary to fully abolished interference. Different from other CRISPR systems investigated in vivo, mutations outside the protospacer region indicated no need for a protospacer adjacent motif sequence to confer DNA interference. However, complementarity of only 3 nucleotides between the repeat-derived 5' handle of the crRNA and nucleotides adjacent to the protospacer enabled self-recognition, i.e. protection of the host locus. Our findings show commonalities and differences among the various CRISPR-mediated defence systems and suggest that they should not merely be perceived as a 'first-barrier-defence system' but may be considered to have a broader mechanism that allows host cells to cope with viruses keeping them at reduced levels.

24021553	Bacteria are constantly challenged by foreign genetic elements such as bacteriophages and plasmids. Several defense systems provide immunity against such attackers, including restriction-modification (R-M) systems and clustered, regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs). These systems target attacking DNA and thus antagonize natural transformation, which relies on uptake of exogenous DNA to promote acquisition of new genetic traits. It is unclear how this antagonization occurs, because transforming DNA is single stranded, and thus resistant to these immune systems. Here, we propose a simple model whereby these systems limit transformation by attack of transformed chromosomes once double strandedness is restored by chromosomal replication.

24013562	Cas9 is an RNA-guided double-stranded DNA nuclease that participates in clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-mediated adaptive immunity in prokaryotes. CRISPR-Cas9 has recently been used to generate insertion and deletion mutations in Caenorhabditis elegans, but not to create tailored changes (knock-ins). We show that the CRISPR-CRISPR-associated (Cas) system can be adapted for efficient and precise editing of the C. elegans genome. The targeted double-strand breaks generated by CRISPR are substrates for transgene-instructed gene conversion. This allows customized changes in the C. elegans genome by homologous recombination: sequences contained in the repair template (the transgene) are copied by gene conversion into the genome. The possibility to edit the C. elegans genome at selected locations will facilitate the systematic study of gene function in this widely used model organism.	C Chen|LA Fenk|M de Bono
24002648	We report a simple yet extremely efficient platform for systematic gene targeting by the RNA-guided endonuclease Cas9 in Drosophila. The system comprises two transgenic strains: one expressing Cas9 protein from the germline-specific nanos promoter and the other ubiquitously expressing a custom guide RNA (gRNA) that targets a unique site in the genome. The two strains are crossed to form an active Cas9-gRNA complex specifically in germ cells, which cleaves and mutates the target site. We demonstrate rapid generation of mutants in seven neuropeptide and two microRNA genes in which no mutants have been described. Founder animals stably expressing Cas9-gRNA transmitted germline mutations to an average of 60% of their progeny, a dramatic improvement in efficiency over the previous methods based on transient Cas9 expression. Simultaneous cleavage of two sites by co-expression of two gRNAs efficiently induced internal deletion with frequencies of 4.3-23%. Our method is readily scalable to high-throughput gene targeting, thereby accelerating comprehensive functional annotation of the Drosophila genome.	S Kondo|R Ueda
23995933	Many strains of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis are considered health-promoting probiotic microorganisms and are commonly formulated into fermented dairy foods. Analyses of previously sequenced genomes of B. animalis subsp. lactis have revealed little genetic diversity, suggesting that it is a monomorphic subspecies. However, during a multilocus sequence typing survey of Bifidobacterium, it was revealed that B. animalis subsp. lactis ATCC 27673 gave a profile distinct from that of the other strains of the subspecies. As part of an ongoing study designed to understand the genetic diversity of this subspecies, the genome of this strain was sequenced and compared to other sequenced genomes of B. animalis subsp. lactis and B. animalis subsp. animalis. The complete genome of ATCC 27673 was 1,963,012 bp, contained 1,616 genes and 4 rRNA operons, and had a G+C content of 61.55%. Comparative analyses revealed that the genome of ATCC 27673 contained six distinct genomic islands encoding 83 open reading frames not found in other strains of the same subspecies. In four islands, either phage or mobile genetic elements were identified. In island 6, a novel clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) locus which contained 81 unique spacers was identified. This type I-E CRISPR-cas system differs from the type I-C systems previously identified in this subspecies, representing the first identification of a different system in B. animalis subsp. lactis. This study revealed that ATCC 27673 is a strain of B. animalis subsp. lactis with novel genetic content and suggests that the lack of genetic variability observed is likely due to the repeated sequencing of a limited number of widely distributed commercial strains.

23995389	Study of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has provided important insights in a wide range of fields in biology. The ability to precisely modify genomes is critical to fully realize the utility of model organisms. Here we report a method to edit the C. elegans genome using the clustered, regularly interspersed, short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) RNA-guided Cas9 nuclease and homologous recombination. We demonstrate that Cas9 is able to induce DNA double-strand breaks with specificity for targeted sites and that these breaks can be repaired efficiently by homologous recombination. By supplying engineered homologous repair templates, we generated gfp knock-ins and targeted mutations. Together our results outline a flexible methodology to produce essentially any desired modification in the C. elegans genome quickly and at low cost. This technology is an important addition to the array of genetic techniques already available in this experimentally tractable model organism.	DJ Dickinson|JD Ward|DJ Reiner|B Goldstein
23979020	Technologies allowing for specific regulation of endogenous genes are valuable for the study of gene functions and have great potential in therapeutics. We created the CRISPR-on system, a two-component transcriptional activator consisting of a nuclease-dead Cas9 (dCas9) protein fused with a transcriptional activation domain and single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) with complementary sequence to gene promoters. We demonstrate that CRISPR-on can efficiently activate exogenous reporter genes in both human and mouse cells in a tunable manner. In addition, we show that robust reporter gene activation in vivo can be achieved by injecting the system components into mouse zygotes. Furthermore, we show that CRISPR-on can activate the endogenous IL1RN, SOX2, and OCT4 genes. The most efficient gene activation was achieved by clusters of 3-4 sgRNAs binding to the proximal promoters, suggesting their synergistic action in gene induction. Significantly, when sgRNAs targeting multiple genes were simultaneously introduced into cells, robust multiplexed endogenous gene activation was achieved. Genome-wide expression profiling demonstrated high specificity of the system.	AW Cheng|H Wang|H Yang|L Shi|Y Katz|TW Theunissen|S Rangarajan|CS Shivalila|DB Dadon|R Jaenisch

23967192	We determined the genetic maps of the megaplasmids of six neutoroxigenic Clostridium butyricum type E strains from Italy using molecular and bioinformatics techniques. The megaplasmids are circular, not linear as we had previously proposed. The differently-sized megaplasmids share a genetic region that includes structural, metabolic and regulatory genes. In addition, we found that a 168 kb genetic region is present only in the larger megaplasmids of two tested strains, whereas it is absent from the smaller megaplasmids of the four remaining strains. The genetic region unique to the larger megaplasmids contains, among other features, a locus for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR associated (cas) genes, i.e. a bacterial adaptive immune system providing sequence-specific protection from invading genetic elements. Some CRISPR spacer sequences of the neurotoxigenic C. butyricum type E strains showed homology to prophage, phage and plasmid sequences from closely related clostridia species or from distant species, all sharing the intestinal habitat, suggesting that the CRISPR locus might be involved in the microorganism adaptation to the human or animal intestinal environment. Besides, we report here that each of four distinct CRISPR spacers partially matched DNA sequences of different prophages and phages, at identical nucleotide locations. This suggests that, at least in neurotoxigenic C. butyricum type E, the CRISPR locus is potentially able to recognize the same conserved DNA sequence of different invading genetic elements, besides targeting sequences unique to previously encountered invading DNA, as currently predicted for a CRISPR locus. Thus, the results of this study introduce the possibility that CRISPR loci can provide resistance to a wider range of invading DNA elements than previously appreciated. Whether it is more advantageous for the peculiar neurotoxigenic C. butyricum type E strains to maintain or to lose the CRISPR-cas system remains an open question.	A Iacobino|C Scalfaro|G Franciosa

23959171	Bacteriophages (phages) infect bacteria in order to replicate and burst out of the host, killing the cell, when reproduction is completed. Thus, from a bacterial perspective, phages pose a persistent lethal threat to bacterial populations. Not surprisingly, bacteria evolved multiple defense barriers to interfere with nearly every step of phage life cycles. Phages respond to this selection pressure by counter-evolving their genomes to evade bacterial resistance. The antagonistic interaction between bacteria and rapidly diversifying viruses promotes the evolution and dissemination of bacteriophage-resistance mechanisms in bacteria. Recently, an adaptive microbial immune system, named clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and which provides acquired immunity against viruses and plasmids, has been identified. Unlike the restriction–modification anti-phage barrier that subjects to cleavage any foreign DNA lacking a protective methyl-tag in the target site, the CRISPR–Cas systems are invader-specific, adaptive, and heritable. In this review, we focus on the molecular mechanisms of interference/immunity provided by different CRISPR–Cas systems.	G Gasiunas|T Sinkunas|V Siksnys

23956122	Precise and straightforward methods to edit the plant genome are much needed for functional genomics and crop improvement. Recently, RNA-guided genome editing using bacterial Type II cluster regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated nuclease (Cas) is emerging as an efficient tool for genome editing in microbial and animal systems. Here, we report the genome editing and targeted gene mutation in plants via the CRISPR-Cas9 system. Three guide RNAs (gRNAs) with a 20-22-nt seed region were designed to pair with distinct rice genomic sites which are followed by the protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM). The engineered gRNAs were shown to direct the Cas9 nuclease for precise cleavage at the desired sites and introduce mutation (insertion or deletion) by error-prone non-homologous end joining DNA repairing. By analyzing the RNA-guided genome-editing events, the mutation efficiency at these target sites was estimated to be 3-8%. In addition, the off-target effect of an engineered gRNA-Cas9 was found on an imperfectly paired genomic site, but it had lower genome-editing efficiency than the perfectly matched site. Further analysis suggests that mismatch position between gRNA seed and target DNA is an important determinant of the gRNA-Cas9 targeting specificity, and specific gRNAs could be designed to target more than 90% of rice genes. Our results demonstrate that the CRISPR-Cas system can be exploited as a powerful tool for gene targeting and precise genome editing in plants.	K Xie|Y Yang
23935102	Small RNAs undergo maturation events that precisely determine the length and structure required for their function. CRISPRs (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) encode small RNAs (crRNAs) that together with CRISPR-associated (cas) genes constitute a sequence-specific prokaryotic immune system for anti-viral and anti-plasmid defense. crRNAs are subject to multiple processing events during their biogenesis, and little is known about the mechanism of the final maturation step. We show that in the Staphylococcus epidermidis type III CRISPR-Cas system, mature crRNAs are measured in a Cas10·Csm ribonucleoprotein complex to yield discrete lengths that differ by 6-nucleotide increments. We looked for mutants that impact this crRNA size pattern and found that an alanine substitution of a conserved aspartate residue of Csm3 eliminates the 6-nucleotide increments in the length of crRNAs. In vitro, recombinant Csm3 binds RNA molecules at multiple sites, producing gel-shift patterns that suggest that each protein binds 6 nucleotides of substrate. In vivo, changes in the levels of Csm3 modulate the crRNA size distribution without disrupting the 6-nucleotide periodicity. Our data support a model in which multiple Csm3 molecules within the Cas10·Csm complex bind the crRNA with a 6-nucleotide periodicity to function as a ruler that measures the extent of crRNA maturation.

23894338	Lactobacillus paracasei is a member of the normal human and animal gut microbiota and is used extensively in the food industry in starter cultures for dairy products or as probiotics. With the development of low-cost, high-throughput sequencing techniques it has become feasible to sequence many different strains of one species and to determine its "pan-genome". We have sequenced the genomes of 34 different L. paracasei strains, and performed a comparative genomics analysis. We analysed genome synteny and content, focussing on the pan-genome, core genome and variable genome. Each genome was shown to contain around 2800-3100 protein-coding genes, and comparative analysis identified over 4200 ortholog groups that comprise the pan-genome of this species, of which about 1800 ortholog groups make up the conserved core. Several factors previously associated with host-microbe interactions such as pili, cell-envelope proteinase, hydrolases p40 and p75 or the capacity to produce short branched-chain fatty acids (bkd operon) are part of the L. paracasei core genome present in all analysed strains. The variome consists mainly of hypothetical proteins, phages, plasmids, transposon/conjugative elements, and known functions such as sugar metabolism, cell-surface proteins, transporters, CRISPR-associated proteins, and EPS biosynthesis proteins. An enormous variety and variability of sugar utilization gene cassettes were identified, with each strain harbouring between 25-53 cassettes, reflecting the high adaptability of L. paracasei to different niches. A phylogenomic tree was constructed based on total genome contents, and together with an analysis of horizontal gene transfer events we conclude that evolution of these L. paracasei strains is complex and not always related to niche adaptation. The results of this genome content comparison was used, together with high-throughput growth experiments on various carbohydrates, to perform gene-trait matching analysis, in order to link the distribution pattern of a specific phenotype to the presence/absence of specific sets of genes.

23892898	Short guide RNAs (gRNAs) can direct catalytically inactive CRISPR-associated 9 nuclease (dCas9) to repress endogenous genes in bacteria and human cells. Here we show that single or multiple gRNAs can direct dCas9 fused to a VP64 transcriptional activation domain to increase expression of endogenous human genes. This proof-of-principle work shows that clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas systems can target heterologous effector domains to endogenous sites in human cells.

23892895	Technologies for engineering synthetic transcription factors have enabled many advances in medical and scientific research. In contrast to existing methods based on engineering of DNA-binding proteins, we created a Cas9-based transactivator that is targeted to DNA sequences by guide RNA molecules. Coexpression of this transactivator and combinations of guide RNAs in human cells induced specific expression of endogenous target genes, demonstrating a simple and versatile approach for RNA-guided gene activation.

23891665	CRISPRs (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) are short fragments of DNA that act as an adaptive immune system protecting bacteria against invasion by phages, plasmids or other forms of foreign DNA. Bacteria without a CRISPR locus may more readily adapt to environmental changes by acquiring foreign genetic material. Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) live in a number of environments suggesting an ability to rapidly adapt to new environments. If UPEC are more adaptive than commensal E. coli we would expect that UPEC would have fewer CRISPR loci, and--if loci are present--that they would harbor fewer spacers than CRISPR loci in fecal E. coli. We tested this in vivo by comparing the number of CRISPR loci and spacers, and sensitivity to antibiotics (resistance is often obtained via plasmids) among 81 pairs of UPEC and fecal E. coli isolated from women with urinary tract infection. Each pair included one uropathogen and one commensal (fecal) sample from the same female patient. Fecal isolates had more repeats (p=0.009) and more unique spacers (p<0.0001) at four CRISPR loci than uropathogens. By contrast, uropathogens were more likely than fecal E. coli to be resistant to ampicillin, cefazolin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. However, no consistent association between CRISPRs and antibiotic resistance was identified. To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare fecal E. coli and pathogenic E. coli from the same individuals, and to test the association of CRISPR loci with antibiotic resistance. Our results suggest that the absence of CRISPR loci may make UPEC more susceptible to infection by phages or plasmids and allow them to adapt more quickly to various environments.

23887171	Members of the genus Candidatus Accumulibacter are important in many wastewater treatment systems performing enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR). The Accumulibacter lineage can be subdivided phylogenetically into multiple clades, and previous work showed that these clades are ecologically distinct. The complete genome of Candidatus Accumulibacter phosphatis strain UW-1, a member of Clade IIA, was previously sequenced. Here, we report a draft genome sequence of Candidatus Accumulibacter spp. strain UW-2, a member of Clade IA, assembled following shotgun metagenomic sequencing of laboratory-scale bioreactor sludge. We estimate the genome to be 80-90% complete. Although the two clades share 16S rRNA sequence identity of >98.0%, we observed a remarkable lack of synteny between the two genomes. We identified 2317 genes shared between the two genomes, with an average nucleotide identity (ANI) of 78.3%, and accounting for 49% of genes in the UW-1 genome. Unlike UW-1, the UW-2 genome seemed to lack genes for nitrogen fixation and carbon fixation. Despite these differences, metabolic genes essential for denitrification and EBPR, including carbon storage polymer and polyphosphate metabolism, were conserved in both genomes. The ANI from genes associated with EBPR was statistically higher than that from genes not associated with EBPR, indicating a high selective pressure in EBPR systems. Further, we identified genomic islands of foreign origins including a near-complete lysogenic phage in the Clade IA genome. Interestingly, Clade IA appeared to be more phage susceptible based on it containing only a single Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats locus as compared with the two found in Clade IIA. Overall, the comparative analysis provided a genetic basis to understand physiological differences and ecological niches of Accumulibacter populations, and highlights the importance of diversity in maintaining system functional resilience.

23879538	Phages are viruses of bacteria. The interaction between phages and bacteria shall boost both parties' evolution. During the lengthy coevolution, the host has evolved multiple mechanisms against the phages. The phages also have evolved unique strategies to facilitate their own survival accordingly. This article summarizes the measures and countermeasures employed by the both parties and their implications for better biomedicines.	Z Zhang|C Huang|W Pan|J Xie
23857052	The discovery of biological concepts can often provide a framework for the development of novel molecular tools, which can help us to further understand and manipulate life. One recent example is the elucidation of the prokaryotic adaptive immune system, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) that protects bacteria and archaea against viruses or conjugative plasmids. The immunity is based on small RNA molecules that are incorporated into versatile multi-domain proteins or protein complexes and specifically target viral nucleic acids via base complementarity. CRISPR/Cas interference machines are utilized to develop novel genome editing tools for different organisms. Here, we will review the latest progress in the elucidation and application of prokaryotic CRISPR/Cas systems and discuss possible future approaches to exploit the potential of these interference machineries.

23851088	The Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) strains, including those of O157:H7 and the "big six" serogroups (i.e., serogroups O26, O45, O103, O111, O121, and O145), are a group of pathogens designated food adulterants in the United States. The relatively conserved nature of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) in phylogenetically related E. coli strains makes them potential subtyping markers for STEC detection, and a quantitative PCR (qPCR)-based assay was previously developed for O26:H11, O45:H2, O103:H2, O111:H8, O121:H19, O145:H28, and O157:H7 isolates. To better evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of this qPCR method, the CRISPR loci of 252 O157 and big-six STEC isolates were sequenced and analyzed along with 563 CRISPR1 and 624 CRISPR2 sequences available in GenBank. General conservation of spacer content and order was observed within each O157 and big-six serogroup, validating the qPCR method. Meanwhile, it was found that spacer deletion, the presence of an insertion sequence, and distinct alleles within a serogroup are sources of false-negative reactions. Conservation of CRISPR arrays among isolates expressing the same flagellar antigen, specifically, H7, H2, and H11, suggested that these isolates share an ancestor and provided an explanation for the false positives previously observed in the qPCR results. An analysis of spacer distribution across E. coli strains provided limited evidence for temporal spacer acquisition. Conversely, comparison of CRISPR sequences between strains along the stepwise evolution of O157:H7 from its O55:H7 ancestor revealed that, over this ∼7,000-year span, spacer deletion was the primary force generating CRISPR diversity.

23846216	The Cascade complex for CRISPR-mediated antiviral immunity uses CRISPR RNA (crRNA) to target invading DNA species from mobile elements such as viruses, leading to their destruction. The core of the Cascade effector complex consists of the Cas5 and Cas7 subunits, which are widely conserved in prokaryotes. Cas7 binds crRNA and forms the helical backbone of Cascade. Many archaea encode a version of the Cascade complex (denoted Type I-A) that includes a Csa5 (or small) subunit, which interacts weakly with the core proteins. Here, we report the crystal structure of the Csa5 protein from Sulfolobus solfataricus. Csa5 comprises a conserved α-helical domain with a small insertion consisting of a weakly conserved β-strand domain. In the crystal, the Csa5 monomers have multimerized into infinite helical threads. At each interface is a strictly conserved intersubunit salt bridge, deletion of which disrupts multimerization. Structural analysis indicates a shared evolutionary history among the small subunits of the CRISPR effector complexes. The same α-helical domain is found in the C-terminal domain of Cse2 (from Type I-E Cascade), while the N-terminal domain of Cse2 is found in Cmr5 of the CMR (Type III-B) effector complex. As Cmr5 shares no match with Csa5, two possibilities present themselves: selective domain loss from an ancestral Cse2 to create two new subfamilies or domain fusion of two separate families to create a new Cse2 family. A definitive answer awaits structural studies of further small subunits from other CRISPR effector complexes.	J Reeks|S Graham|L Anderson|H Liu|MF White|JH Naismith
23827738	Here, we present a simple and highly efficient method for generating and detecting mutations of any gene in Drosophila melanogaster through the use of the CRISPR/Cas9 system (clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated). We show that injection of RNA into the Drosophila embryo can induce highly efficient mutagenesis of desired target genes in up to 88% of injected flies. These mutations can be transmitted through the germline to make stable lines. Our system provides at least a 10-fold improvement in efficiency over previously published reports, enabling wider application of this technique. We also describe a simple and highly sensitive method of detecting mutations in the target gene by high-resolution melt analysis and discuss how the new technology enables the study of gene function.

23820428	Bacteria have developed a set of barriers to protect themselves against invaders such as phage and plasmid nucleic acids. Different prokaryotic defence systems exist and at least two of them directly target the incoming DNA: restriction-modification (R-M) and CRISPR-Cas systems. On their own, they are imperfect barriers to invasion by foreign DNA. Here, we show that R-M and CRISPR-Cas systems are compatible and act together to increase the overall phage resistance of a bacterial cell by cleaving their respective target sites. Furthermore, we show that the specific methylation of phage DNA does not impair CRISPR-Cas acquisition or interference activities. Taken altogether, both mechanisms can be leveraged to decrease phage contaminations in processes relying on bacterial growth and/or fermentation.	MÈ Dupuis|M Villion|AH Magadán|S Moineau
23810125	Native CRISPR-Cas adaptive immunity systems prevent plasmid conjugation and virus-mediated gene transfer.

23790627	Precise modifications of complex genomes at the single nucleotide level have been one of the big goals for scientists working in basic and applied genetics, including biotechnology, drug development, gene therapy and synthetic biology. However, the relevant techniques for making these manipulations in model organisms and human cells have been lagging behind the rapid high throughput studies in the post-genomic era with a bottleneck of low efficiency, time consuming and laborious manipulation, and off-targeting problems. Recent discoveries of TALEs (transcription activator-like effectors) coding system and CRISPR (clusters of regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) immune system in bacteria have enabled the development of customized TALENs (transcription activator-like effector nucleases) and CRISPR/Cas9 to rapidly edit genomic DNA in a variety of cell types, including human cells, and different model organisms at a very high efficiency and specificity. In this review, we first briefly summarize the development and applications of TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing technologies; compare the advantages and constraints of each method; particularly, discuss the expected applications of both techniques in the field of site-specific genome modification and stem cell based gene therapy; finally, propose the future directions and perspectives for readers to make the choices.

23709638	We have adapted a bacterial CRISPR RNA/Cas9 system to precisely engineer the Drosophila genome and report that Cas9-mediated genomic modifications are efficiently transmitted through the germline.

23701169	Virus-host interactions are a key factor shaping population dynamics of microbial species. The CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune system confers sequence-specific immunity to viral infection and has the potential to dramatically shape coevolutionary interactions between viruses and their microbial hosts. To assess evolutionary dynamics of CRISPR loci, we have sampled a population of closely related Sulfolobus islandicus strains from Kamchatka, Russia at two time points, 10 years apart. Sequence analysis of the conserved trailer sequences reveals that alleles are reassorted among three CRISPR spacer loci into combinatorial genotypes. Reassortment provides the evolutionary independence of CRISPR loci from one another as demonstrated by the differential change in allele frequencies between two time points. Genome sequences of 12 strains from this population also reveal very recent horizontal gene transfer of novel, divergent cas gene cassettes. The evolutionary independence of CRISPR loci from each other and of the cas genes that control their function are consistent with the evolutionary expectation that reassortment increases the efficiency of adaptation at these loci that are likely under strong selection by lytic viruses.

23691509	Viruses specifically infecting bacteria, or bacteriophages, are the most common biological entity in the biosphere. As such, they greatly influence bacteria, both in terms of enhancing their virulence and in terms of killing them. Since the first identification of bacteriophages in the beginning of the 20th century, researchers have been fascinated by these microorganisms and their ability to eradicate bacteria. In this review, we will cover the history of the Propionibacterium acnes bacteriophage research and point out how bacteriophage research has been an important part of the research on P. acnes itself. We will further discuss recent findings from phage genome sequencing and the identification of phage sequence signatures in clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs). Finally, the potential to use P. acnes bacteriophages as a therapeutic strategy to combat P. acnes-associated diseases will be discussed.	H Brüggemann|R Lood
23664777	Zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) comprise a powerful class of tools that are redefining the boundaries of biological research. These chimeric nucleases are composed of programmable, sequence-specific DNA-binding modules linked to a nonspecific DNA cleavage domain. ZFNs and TALENs enable a broad range of genetic modifications by inducing DNA double-strand breaks that stimulate error-prone nonhomologous end joining or homology-directed repair at specific genomic locations. Here, we review achievements made possible by site-specific nuclease technologies and discuss applications of these reagents for genetic analysis and manipulation. In addition, we highlight the therapeutic potential of ZFNs and TALENs and discuss future prospects for the field, including the emergence of clustered regulatory interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas-based RNA-guided DNA endonucleases.

23661565	Mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and genetic rearrangement are considered as major driving forces of bacterial diversification. Previous comparative genome analysis of Porphyromonas gingivalis, a pathogen related to periodontitis, implied such an important relationship. As a counterpart system to MGEs, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) in bacteria may be useful for genetic typing. We found that CRISPR typing could be a reasonable alternative to conventional methods for characterizing phylogenetic relationships among 60 highly diverse P. gingivalis isolates. Examination of genetic recombination along with multilocus sequence typing suggests the importance of such events between different isolates. MGEs appear to be strategically located at the breakpoint gaps of complicated genome rearrangements. Of these MGEs, insertion sequences (ISs) were found most frequently. CRISPR analysis identified 2,150 spacers that were clustered into 1,187 unique ones. Most of these spacers exhibited no significant nucleotide similarity to known sequences (97.6%: 1,158/1,187). Surprisingly, CRISPR spacers exhibiting high nucleotide similarity to regions of P. gingivalis genomes including ISs were predominant. The proportion of such spacers to all the unique spacers (1.6%: 19/1,187) was the highest among previous studies, suggesting novel functions for these CRISPRs. These results indicate that P. gingivalis is a bacterium with high intraspecies diversity caused by frequent insertion sequence (IS) transposition, whereas both the introduction of foreign DNA, primarily from other P. gingivalis cells, and IS transposition are limited by CRISPR interference. It is suggested that P. gingivalis CRISPRs could be an important source for understanding the role of CRISPRs in the development of bacterial diversity.

23637754	Phage therapy may become a complement to antibiotics in the treatment of chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. To design efficient therapeutic cocktails, the genetic diversity of the species and the spectrum of susceptibility to bacteriophages must be investigated. Bacterial strains showing high levels of phage resistance need to be identified in order to decipher the underlying mechanisms. Here we have selected genetically diverse P. aeruginosa strains from cystic fibrosis patients and tested their susceptibility to a large collection of phages. Based on plaque morphology and restriction profiles, six different phages were purified from "pyophage", a commercial cocktail directed against five different bacterial species, including P. aeruginosa. Characterization of these phages by electron microscopy and sequencing of genome fragments showed that they belong to 4 different genera. Among 47 P. aeruginosa strains, 13 were not lysed by any of the isolated phages individually or by pyophage. We isolated two new phages that could lyse some of these strains, and their genomes were sequenced. The presence/absence of a CRISPR-Cas system (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats and Crisper associated genes) was investigated to evaluate the role of the system in phage resistance. Altogether, the results show that some P. aeruginosa strains cannot support the growth of any of the tested phages belonging to 5 different genera, and suggest that the CRISPR-Cas system is not a major defence mechanism against these lytic phages.

23637624	In prokaryotes, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) and their associated (Cas) proteins constitute a defence system against bacteriophages and plasmids. CRISPR/Cas systems acquire short spacer sequences from foreign genetic elements and incorporate these into their CRISPR arrays, generating a memory of past invaders. Defence is provided by short non-coding RNAs that guide Cas proteins to cleave complementary nucleic acids. While most spacers are acquired from phages and plasmids, there are examples of spacers that match genes elsewhere in the host bacterial chromosome. In Pectobacterium atrosepticum the type I-F CRISPR/Cas system has acquired a self-complementary spacer that perfectly matches a protospacer target in a horizontally acquired island (HAI2) involved in plant pathogenicity. Given the paucity of experimental data about CRISPR/Cas-mediated chromosomal targeting, we examined this process by developing a tightly controlled system. Chromosomal targeting was highly toxic via targeting of DNA and resulted in growth inhibition and cellular filamentation. The toxic phenotype was avoided by mutations in the cas operon, the CRISPR repeats, the protospacer target, and protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) beside the target. Indeed, the natural self-targeting spacer was non-toxic due to a single nucleotide mutation adjacent to the target in the PAM sequence. Furthermore, we show that chromosomal targeting can result in large-scale genomic alterations, including the remodelling or deletion of entire pre-existing pathogenicity islands. These features can be engineered for the targeted deletion of large regions of bacterial chromosomes. In conclusion, in DNA-targeting CRISPR/Cas systems, chromosomal interference is deleterious by causing DNA damage and providing a strong selective pressure for genome alterations, which may have consequences for bacterial evolution and pathogenicity.

23619643	In Escherichia coli, the acquisition of new CRISPR spacers is strongly stimulated by a priming interaction between a spacer in CRISPR RNA and a protospacer in foreign DNA. Priming also leads to a pronounced bias in DNA strand from which new spacers are selected. Here, ca. 200,000 spacers acquired during E. coli type I-E CRISPR/Cas-driven plasmid elimination were analyzed. Analysis of positions of plasmid protospacers from which newly acquired spacers have been derived is inconsistent with spacer acquisition machinery sliding along the target DNA as the primary mechanism responsible for strand bias during primed spacer acquisition. Most protospacers that served as donors of newly acquired spacers during primed spacer acquisition had an AAG protospacer adjacent motif, PAM. Yet, the introduction of multiple AAG sequences in the target DNA had no effect on the choice of protospacers used for adaptation, which again is inconsistent with the sliding mechanism. Despite a strong preference for an AAG PAM during CRISPR adaptation, the AAG (and CTT) triplets do not appear to be avoided in known E. coli phages. Likewise, PAM sequences are not avoided in Streptococcus thermophilus phages, indicating that CRISPR/Cas systems may not have been a strong factor in shaping host-virus interactions.

23598790	The human oral cavity has an indigenous microbiota known to include a robust community of viruses. Very little is known about how oral viruses are spread throughout the environment or to which viruses individuals are exposed. We sought to determine whether shared living environment is associated with the composition of human oral viral communities by examining the saliva of 21 human subjects; 11 subjects from different households and 10 unrelated subjects comprising 4 separate households. Although there were many viral homologues shared among all subjects studied, there were significant patterns of shared homologues in three of the four households that suggest shared living environment affects viral community composition. We also examined CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat) loci, which are involved in acquired bacterial and archaeal resistance against invading viruses by acquiring short viral sequences. We analyzed 2 065 246 CRISPR spacers from 5 separate repeat motifs found in oral bacterial species of Gemella, Veillonella, Leptotrichia and Streptococcus to determine whether individuals from shared living environments may have been exposed to similar viruses. A significant proportion of CRISPR spacers were shared within subjects from the same households, suggesting either shared ancestry of their oral microbiota or similar viral exposures. Many CRISPR spacers matched virome sequences from different subjects, but no pattern specific to any household was found. Our data on viromes and CRISPR content indicate that shared living environment may have a significant role in determining the ecology of human oral viruses.

23594992	To fend off foreign genetic elements, prokaryotes have developed several defense systems. The most recently discovered defense system, CRISPR/Cas, is sequence-specific, adaptive and heritable. The two central components of this system are the Cas proteins and the CRISPR RNA. The latter consists of repeat sequences that are interspersed with spacer sequences. The CRISPR locus is transcribed into a precursor RNA that is subsequently processed into short crRNAs. CRISPR/Cas systems have been identified in bacteria and archaea, and data show that many variations of this system exist. We analyzed the requirements for a successful defense reaction in the halophilic archaeon Haloferax volcanii. Haloferax encodes a CRISPR/Cas system of the I-B subtype, about which very little is known. Analysis of the mature crRNAs revealed that they contain a spacer as their central element, which is preceded by an eight-nucleotide-long 5' handle that originates from the upstream repeat. The repeat sequences have the potential to fold into a minimal stem loop. Sequencing of the crRNA population indicated that not all of the spacers that are encoded by the three CRISPR loci are present in the same abundance. By challenging Haloferax with an invader plasmid, we demonstrated that the interaction of the crRNA with the invader DNA requires a 10-nucleotide-long seed sequence. In addition, we found that not all of the crRNAs from the three CRISPR loci are effective at triggering the degradation of invader plasmids. The interference does not seem to be influenced by the copy number of the invader plasmid.	LK Maier|SJ Lange|B Stoll|KA Haas|S Fischer|E Fischer|E Duchardt-Ferner|J Wöhnert|R Backofen|A Marchfelder
23594878	The 2 465 177 bp genome of Sulfolobus islandicus LAL14/1, host of the model rudivirus SIRV2, was sequenced. Exhaustive comparative genomic analysis of S. islandicus LAL14/1 and the nine other completely sequenced S. islandicus strains isolated from Iceland, Russia and USA revealed a highly syntenic common core genome of approximately 2 Mb and a long hyperplastic region containing most of the strain-specific genes. In LAL14/1, the latter region is enriched in insertion sequences, CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats), glycosyl transferase genes, toxin-antitoxin genes and MITE (miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements). The tRNA genes of LAL14/1 are preferential targets for the integration of mobile elements but clusters of atypical genes (CAG) are also integrated elsewhere in the genome. LAL14/1 carries five CRISPR loci with 10 per cent of spacers matching perfectly or imperfectly the genomes of archaeal viruses and plasmids found in the Icelandic hot springs. Strikingly, the CRISPR_2 region of LAL14/1 carries an unusually long 1.9 kb spacer interspersed between two repeat regions and displays a high similarity to pING1-like conjugative plasmids. Finally, we have developed a genetic system for S. islandicus LAL14/1 and created ΔpyrEF and ΔCRISPR_1 mutants using double cross-over and pop-in/pop-out approaches, respectively. Thus, LAL14/1 is a promising model to study virus-host interactions and the CRISPR/Cas defence mechanism in Archaea.

23584158	CRISPR loci consist of an array of short repeats separated by spacer sequences that match the genome of viruses and plasmids that infect prokaryotes. Transcription of the CRISPR array generates small antisense RNAs that mediate immunity against these invaders. In recent years, there has been a notable increase in the investigation of CRISPR immunity, but studies have been restricted to organisms in which genetic manipulations are possible. Therefore, there is a need for the development of simple genetic tools that facilitate the study of this important pathway. Here we describe the use of CRISPR decoys, plasmids containing a non-transcribed repeat-spacer unit that disrupt CRISPR immunity. We show that decoys abrogate immunity against conjugation in S. epidermidis to levels comparable to a CRISPR deletion mutant. This technique can be used to generate full or spacer-specific CRISPR knockdowns in organisms in which decoy plasmids can be introduced.	I Maniv|A Hatoum-Aslan|LA Marraffini
23584138	Microarray analysis of infection by a lytic Sulfolobus rudivirus, SIRV2, revealed both the temporal expression of viral genes and the differential regulation of host genes. A highly susceptible strain derived from Sulfolobus solfataricus P2 with a large genomic deletion spanning CRISPR clusters A to D was infected with SIRV2, and subjected to a microarray analysis. Transcripts from a few viral genes were detected at 15 min post-infection and all except one were expressed within 2 h. The earliest expressed genes were located mainly at the termini of the linear viral genome while later expressed genes were concentrated in the central region. Timing of the expression correlated with the known or predicted functions of the viral gene products and, thus, should facilitate functional characterization of many hypothetical viral genes. Evaluation of the microarray data with quantitative reverse-transcription PCR analyses of a few selected viral genes revealed a good correlation between the two methods. Expression of about 3,000 host genes was examined. Seventy-two were downregulated>2-fold that were mainly associated with stress response and vesicle formation, as well as chromosome structure maintenance, which appears to contribute to host chromosome degradation and cellular collapse. A further 76 host genes were upregulated>2-fold and they were dominated by genes associated with metabolism and membrane transport, including phosphate transport and DNA precursor synthesis. The altered transcriptional patterns suggest that the virus reprograms the host cellular machinery to facilitate its own DNA replication and to inhibit cellular processes required for defense against viruses.

23535981	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) are currently a topic of interest in microbiology due to their role as a prokaryotic immune system. Investigations of CRISPR distribution and characterization to date have focused on pathogenic bacteria, while less is known about CRISPR in commensal bacteria, where they may have a significant role in the ecology of the microbiota of humans and other animals, and act as a recorder of interactions between bacteria and viruses. A combination of PCR and sequencing was used to determine prevalence and distribution of CRISPR arrays in Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus hirae isolates from the feces of healthy pigs. Both type II CRISPR-Cas and Orphan CRISPR (without Cas genes) were detected in the 195 isolates examined. CRISPR-Cas was detected in 52 (46/88) and 42 % (45/107) E. faecalis and E. hirae isolates, respectively. The prevalence of Orphan CRISPR arrays was higher in E. faecalis isolates (95 %, 84/88) compared with E. hirae isolates (49 %, 53/107). Species-specific repeat sequences were identified in Orphan CRISPR arrays, and 42 unique spacer sequences were identified. Only two spacers matched previously characterized pig virome sequences, and many were apparently derived from chromosomal sequences of enterococci. Surprisingly, 17 (40 %) of the spacers were detected in both species. Shared spacer sequences are evidence of a lack of species specificity in the agents and mechanisms responsible for integration of spacers, and the abundance of spacer sequences corresponding to bacterial chromosomal sequences reflects interspecific interactions within the intestinal microbiota.

23535277	CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-mediated virus defense based on small RNAs is a hallmark of archaea and also found in many bacteria. Archaeal genomes and, in particular, organisms of the extremely thermoacidophilic genus Sulfolobus, carry extensive CRISPR loci each with dozens of sequence signatures (spacers) able to mediate targeting and degradation of complementary invading nucleic acids. The diversity of CRISPR systems and their associated protein complexes indicates an extensive functional breadth and versatility of this adaptive immune system. Sulfolobus solfataricus and S. islandicus represent two of the best characterized genetic model organisms in the archaea not only with respect to the CRISPR system. Here we address and discuss in a broader context particularly recent progress made in understanding spacer recruitment from foreign DNA, production of small RNAs, in vitro activity of CRISPR-associated protein complexes and attack of viruses and plasmids in in vivo test systems.

23535272	The Cas9-crRNA complex of the Streptococcus thermophilus DGCC7710 CRISPR3-Cas system functions as an RNA-guided endonuclease with crRNA-directed target sequence recognition and protein-mediated DNA cleavage. We show here that an additional RNA molecule, tracrRNA (trans-activating CRISPR RNA), co-purifies with the Cas9 protein isolated from the heterologous E. coli strain carrying the S. thermophilus DGCC7710 CRISPR3-Cas system. We provide experimental evidence that tracrRNA is required for Cas9-mediated DNA interference both in vitro and in vivo. We show that Cas9 specifically promotes duplex formation between the precursor crRNA (pre-crRNA) transcript and tracrRNA, in vitro. Furthermore, the housekeeping RNase III contributes to primary pre-crRNA-tracrRNA duplex cleavage for mature crRNA biogenesis. RNase III, however, is not required in the processing of a short pre-crRNA transcribed from a minimal CRISPR array containing a single spacer. Finally, we show that an in vitro-assembled ternary Cas9-crRNA-tracrRNA complex cleaves DNA. This study further specifies the molecular basis for crRNA-based re-programming of Cas9 to specifically cleave any target DNA sequence for precise genome surgery. The processes for crRNA maturation and effector complex assembly established here will contribute to the further development of the Cas9 re-programmable system for genome editing applications.

23535265	Most prokaryotes contain CRISPR-Cas immune systems that provide protection against mobile genetic elements. We have focused on the ability of CRISPR-Cas to block plasmid conjugation, and analyzed the position of target sequences (protospacers) on conjugative plasmids. The analysis reveals that protospacers are non-uniformly distributed over plasmid regions in a pattern that is determined by the plasmid's mobilization type (MOB). While MOBP plasmids are most frequently targeted in the region entering the recipient cell last (lagging region), MOBF plasmids are mostly targeted in the region entering the recipient cell first (leading region). To explain this protospacer distribution bias, we propose two mutually non-exclusive hypotheses: (1) spacers are acquired more frequently from either the leading or lagging region depending on the MOB type (2) CRISPR-interference is more efficient when spacers target these preferred regions. To test the latter hypothesis, we analyzed Type I-E CRISPR-interference against MOBF prototype plasmid F in Escherichia coli. Our results show that plasmid conjugation is effectively inhibited, but the level of immunity is not affected by targeting the plasmid in the leading or lagging region. Moreover, CRISPR-immunity levels do not depend on whether the incoming single-stranded plasmid DNA, or the DNA strand synthesized in the recipient is targeted. Our findings indicate that single-stranded DNA may not be a target for Type I-E CRISPR-Cas systems, and suggest that the protospacer distribution bias might be due to spacer acquisition preferences.

23535213	CRISPR-Cas systems are RNA-guided immune systems that protect prokaryotes against viruses and other invaders. The CRISPR locus encodes crRNAs that recognize invading nucleic acid sequences and trigger silencing by the associated Cas proteins. There are multiple CRISPR-Cas systems with distinct compositions and mechanistic processes. Thermococcus kodakarensis (Tko) is a hyperthermophilic euryarchaeon that has both a Type I-A Csa and a Type I-B Cst CRISPR-Cas system. We have analyzed the expression and composition of crRNAs from the three CRISPRs in Tko by RNA deep sequencing and northern analysis. Our results indicate that crRNAs associated with these two CRISPR-Cas systems include an 8-nucleotide conserved sequence tag at the 5' end. We challenged Tko with plasmid invaders containing sequences targeted by endogenous crRNAs and observed active CRISPR-Cas-mediated silencing. Plasmid silencing was dependent on complementarity with a crRNA as well as on a sequence element found immediately adjacent to the crRNA recognition site in the target termed the PAM (protospacer adjacent motif). Silencing occurred independently of the orientation of the target sequence in the plasmid, and appears to occur at the DNA level, presumably via DNA degradation. In addition, we have directed silencing of an invader plasmid by genetically engineering the chromosomal CRISPR locus to express customized crRNAs directed against the plasmid. Our results support CRISPR engineering as a feasible approach to develop prokaryotic strains that are resistant to infection for use in industry.

23535141	An RNA-based screen was performed to reveal a possible evolutionary scenario for the CRISPR-Cas systems in two cyanobacterial model strains. Following the analysis of a draft genome sequence of Synechocystis sp PCC6714, three different CRISPR-Cas systems were characterized that have different degrees of relatedness to another three CRISPR-Cas systems in Synechocystis sp PCC6803. A subtype III-B system was identified that is extremely conserved between both strains. Strong signals in northern hybridizations and the presence of different spacers (but identical repeats) indicated this system to be active, despite the absence of a known endonuclease candidate gene involved in the maturation of its crRNAs in the two strains. The other two systems were found to differ significantly from each other, with different sets of repeat-spacer arrays and different Cas genes. In view of the otherwise very close relatedness of the two analyzed strains, this is suggestive of an unknown mechanism involved in the replacement of CRISPR-Cas cassettes as a whole. Further RNA analyses revealed the accumulation of crRNAs to be impacted by environmental conditions critical for photoautotropic growth. All six systems are associated with a gene for a possible transcriptional repressor. Indeed, we identified one of these genes, sll7009, as encoding a negative regulator specific for the CRISPR1 subtype I-D system in Synechocystis sp PCC6803.	S Hein|I Scholz|B Voß|WR Hess
23499818	Protection of bacterial cells against virus infection requires expression of molecules that are able to destroy the incoming foreign DNA. However, these molecules can also be toxic for the host cell. In both restriction-modification (R-M), and the recently discovered CRISPR/Cas systems, the toxicity is (in part) avoided through rapid transition of the expression of the toxic molecules from "OFF" to "ON" state. In restriction-modification systems the rapid transition is achieved through a large binding cooperativity, and low translation rate of the control protein. On the other hand, CRISPR array expression in CRISPR/Cas systems involves a mechanism where a small decrease of unprocessed RNAs leads to a rapid increase of processed small RNAs. Surprisingly, this rapid amplification crucially depends on fast non-specific degradation of the unprocessed molecules by an unidentified nuclease, rather than on large cooperativity in protein binding. Furthermore, the major control elements that are responsible for fast transition of R-M and CRISPR/Cas systems from "OFF" to "ON" state, are also directly involved in increased stability of the steady states of these systems. We here discuss mechanisms that allow rapid transition of toxic molecules from the unproductive to the productive state in R-M and CRISPR/Cas systems. The main purpose of this discussion is to put relevant theoretical and experimental work in a perspective that points to general similarities in otherwise mechanistically very different bacterial immune systems.

23492433	The bacterial and archaeal CRISPR/Cas adaptive immune system targets specific protospacer nucleotide sequences in invading organisms. This requires base pairing between processed CRISPR RNA and the target protospacer. For type I and II CRISPR/Cas systems, protospacer adjacent motifs (PAM) are essential for target recognition, and for type III, mismatches in the flanking sequences are important in the antiviral response. In this study, we examine the properties of each class of CRISPR. We use this information to provide a tool (CRISPRTarget) that predicts the most likely targets of CRISPR RNAs (http://bioanalysis.otago.ac.nz/CRISPRTarget). This can be used to discover targets in newly sequenced genomic or metagenomic data. To test its utility, we discover features and targets of well-characterized Streptococcus thermophilus and Sulfolobus solfataricus type II and III CRISPR/Cas systems. Finally, in Pectobacterium species, we identify new CRISPR targets and propose a model of temperate phage exposure and subsequent inhibition by the type I CRISPR/Cas systems.

23478298	Two recent papers in Science illustrate how the prokaryotic CRISPR-Cas immune system machinery, which typically targets invasive genetic elements such as viruses and plasmids, can be converted into a sophisticated molecular tool for next-generation human genome editing. The versatile Cas9 RNA-guided endonuclease can be readily reprogrammed using customizable small RNAs for sequence-specific single- or double-stranded DNA cleavage.	P Horvath|R Barrangou
23470522	The complete genome sequences of archaeal tailed viruses are currently highly underrepresented in sequence databases. Here, we report the genomic sequences of 10 new tailed viruses infecting different haloarchaeal hosts. Among these, only two viral genomes are closely related to each other and to previously described haloviruses HF1 and HF2. The approximately 760 kb of new genomic sequences in total shows no matches to CRISPR/Cas spacer sequences in haloarchaeal host genomes. Despite their high divergence, we were able to identify virion structural and assembly genes as well as genes coding for DNA and RNA metabolic functions. Interestingly, we identified many genes and genomic features that are shared with tailed bacteriophages, consistent with the hypothesis that haloarchaeal and bacterial tailed viruses share common ancestry, and that a viral lineage containing archaeal viruses, bacteriophages and eukaryotic viruses predates the division of the three major domains of non-viral life. However, as in tailed viruses in general and in haloarchaeal tailed viruses in particular, there are still a considerable number of predicted genes of unknown function.

23445770	Prokaryotes immunize themselves against transmissible genetic elements by the integration (acquisition) in clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) loci of spacers homologous to invader nucleic acids, defined as protospacers. Following acquisition, mono-spacer CRISPR RNAs (termed crRNAs) guide CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins to degrade (interference) protospacers flanked by an adjacent motif in extrachomosomal DNA. During acquisition, selection of spacer-precursors adjoining the protospacer motif and proper orientation of the integrated fragment with respect to the leader (sequence leading transcription of the flanking CRISPR array) grant efficient interference by at least some CRISPR-Cas systems. This adaptive stage of the CRISPR action is poorly characterized, mainly due to the lack of appropriate genetic strategies to address its study and, at least in Escherichia coli, the need of Cas overproduction for insertion detection. In this work, we describe the development and application in Escherichia coli strains of an interference-independent assay based on engineered selectable CRISPR-spacer integration reporter plasmids. By using this tool without the constraint of interference or cas overexpression, we confirmed fundamental aspects of this process such as the critical requirement of Cas1 and Cas2 and the identity of the CTT protospacer motif for the E. coli K12 system. In addition, we defined the CWT motif for a non-K12 CRISPR-Cas variant, and obtained data supporting the implication of the leader in spacer orientation, the preferred acquisition from plasmids harboring cas genes and the occurrence of a sequential cleavage at the insertion site by a ruler mechanism.

23442002	The CRISPR/Cas system is known to act as an adaptive and heritable immune system in Eubacteria and Archaea. Immunity is encoded in an array of spacer sequences. Each spacer can provide specific immunity to invasive elements that carry the same or a similar sequence. Even in closely related strains, spacer content is very dynamic and evolves quickly. Standard models of nucleotide evolution cannot be applied to quantify its rate of change since processes other than single nucleotide changes determine its evolution.	We present probabilistic models that are specific for spacer content evolution. They account for the different processes of insertion and deletion. Insertions can be constrained to occur on one end only or are allowed to occur throughout the array. One deletion event can affect one spacer or a whole fragment of adjacent spacers. Parameters of the underlying models are estimated for a pair of arrays by maximum likelihood using explicit ancestor enumeration.	Simulations show that parameters are well estimated on average under the models presented here. There is a bias in the rate estimation when including fragment deletions. The models also estimate times between pairs of strains. But with increasing time, spacer overlap goes to zero, and thus there is an upper bound on the distance that can be estimated. Spacer content similarities are displayed in a distance based phylogeny using the estimated times.We use the presented models to analyze different Yersinia pestis data sets and find that the results among them are largely congruent. The models also capture the variation in diversity of spacers among the data sets. A comparison of spacer-based phylogenies and Cas gene phylogenies shows that they resolve very different time scales for this data set.	The simulations and data analyses show that the presented models are useful for quantifying spacer content evolution and for displaying spacer content similarities of closely related strains in a phylogeny. This allows for comparisons of different CRISPR arrays or for comparisons between CRISPR arrays and nucleotide substitution rates.	A Kupczok|JP Bollback
23439366	The CRISPR-Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, CRISPR-associated genes) is an adaptive immunity system in bacteria and archaea that functions via a distinct self-non-self recognition mechanism that is partially analogous to the mechanism of eukaryotic RNA interference (RNAi). The CRISPR-Cas system incorporates fragments of virus or plasmid DNA into the CRISPR repeat cassettes and employs the processed transcripts of these spacers as guide RNAs to cleave the cognate foreign DNA or RNA. The Cas proteins, however, are not homologous to the proteins involved in RNAi and comprise numerous, highly diverged families. The majority of the Cas proteins contain diverse variants of the RNA recognition motif (RRM), a widespread RNA-binding domain. Despite the fast evolution that is typical of the cas genes, the presence of diverse versions of the RRM in most Cas proteins provides for a simple scenario for the evolution of the three distinct types of CRISPR-cas systems. In addition to several proteins that are directly implicated in the immune response, the cas genes encode a variety of proteins that are homologous to prokaryotic toxins that typically possess nuclease activity. The predicted toxins associated with CRISPR-Cas systems include the essential Cas2 protein, proteins of COG1517 that, in addition to a ligand-binding domain and a helix-turn-helix domain, typically contain different nuclease domains and several other predicted nucleases. The tight association of the CRISPR-Cas immunity systems with predicted toxins that, upon activation, would induce dormancy or cell death suggests that adaptive immunity and dormancy/suicide response are functionally coupled. Such coupling could manifest in the persistence state being induced and potentially providing conditions for more effective action of the immune system or in cell death being triggered when immunity fails.

23439321	The CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas (CRISPR-associated) system of bacteria and archaea constitutes a mechanism of acquired adaptive immunity against phages, which is based on genome-encoded markers of previously infecting phage sequences ("spacers"). As a repository of phage sequences, these spacers make the system particularly suitable for elucidating phage-bacteria interactions in metagenomic studies. Recent metagenomic analyses of CRISPRs associated with the human microbiome intriguingly revealed conserved "memory spacers" shared by bacteria in multiple unrelated, geographically separated individuals. Here, we discuss possible avenues for explaining this phenomenon by integrating insights from CRISPR biology and phage-bacteria ecology, with a special focus on the human gut. We further explore the growing body of evidence for the role of CRISPR/Cas in regulating the interplay between bacteria and lysogenic phages, which may be intimately related to the presence of memory spacers and sheds new light on the multifaceted biological and ecological modes of action of CRISPR/Cas.

23422322	Pyrococcales are members of the order Thermococcales, a group of hyperthermophilic euryarchaea that are frequently found in deep sea hydrothermal vents. Infectious genetic elements, such as plasmids and viruses, remain a threat even in this remote environment and these microorganisms have developed several ways to fight their genetic invaders. Among these are the recently discovered CRISPR systems. In this review, we have combined and condensed available information on genetic elements infecting the Thermococcales and on the multiple CRISPR systems found in the Pyrococcales to fight them. Their organization and mode of action will be presented with emphasis on the Type III-B system that is the only CRISPR system known to target RNA molecules in a process reminiscent of RNA interference. The intriguing case of Pyrococcus abyssi, which is among the rare strains to present a CRISPR system devoid of the universal cas1 and cas2 genes, is also discussed.

23403393	Protospacer adjacent motifs (PAMs) were originally characterized for CRISPR-Cas systems that were classified on the basis of their CRISPR repeat sequences. A few short 2-5 bp sequences were identified adjacent to one end of the protospacers. Experimental and bioinformatical results linked the motif to the excision of protospacers and their insertion into CRISPR loci. Subsequently, evidence accumulated from different virus- and plasmid-targeting assays, suggesting that these motifs were also recognized during DNA interference, at least for the recently classified type I and type II CRISPR-based systems. The two processes, spacer acquisition and protospacer interference, employ different molecular mechanisms, and there is increasing evidence to suggest that the sequence motifs that are recognized, while overlapping, are unlikely to be identical. In this article, we consider the properties of PAM sequences and summarize the evidence for their dual functional roles. It is proposed to use the terms protospacer associated motif (PAM) for the conserved DNA sequence and to employ spacer acqusition motif (SAM) and target interference motif (TIM), respectively, for acquisition and interference recognition sites.

23392318	The prokaryotic antiviral defense systems CRISP R (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas (CRISP Rassociated) employs short crRNAs (CRISP R RNAs) to target invading viral nucleic acids. A short spacer sequence of these crRNAs can be derived from a viral genome and recognizes a reoccurring attack of a virus via base complementarity. We analyzed the effect of spacer sequences on the maturation of crRNAs of the subtype I-B Methanococcus maripaludis C5 CRISP R cluster. The responsible endonuclease, termed Cas6b, bound non-hydrolyzable repeat RNA as a dimer and mature crRNA as a monomer. Comparative analysis of Cas6b processing of individual spacer-repeat-spacer RNA substrates and crRNA stability revealed the potential influence of spacer sequence and length on these parameters. Correlation of these observations with the variable abundance of crRNAs visualized by deep-sequencing analyses is discussed. Finally, insertion of spacer and repeat sequences with archaeal poly-T termination signals is suggested to be prevented in archaeal CRISP R/Cas systems.	H Richter|SJ Lange|R Backofen|L Randau
23392292	Viruses that infect bacteria are the most abundant biological agents on the planet and bacteria have evolved diverse defense mechanisms to combat these genetic parasites. One of these bacterial defense systems relies on a repetitive locus, referred to as a CRISPR (clusters of regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats). Bacteria and archaea acquire resistance to invading viruses and plasmids by integrating short fragments of foreign nucleic acids at one end of the CRISPR locus. CRISPR loci are transcribed and the long primary CRISPR transcript is processed into a library of small RNAs that guide the immune system to invading nucleic acids, which are subsequently degraded by dedicated nucleases. However, the development of CRISPR-mediated immune systems has not eradicated phages, suggesting that viruses have evolved mechanisms to subvert CRISPR-mediated protection. Recently, Bondy-Denomy and colleagues discovered several phage-encoded anti-CRISPR proteins that offer new insight into the ongoing molecular arms race between viral parasites and the immune systems of their hosts.

23386978	Type II CRISPR immune systems in bacteria use a dual RNA-guided DNA endonuclease, Cas9, to cleave foreign DNA at specific sites. We show here that Cas9 assembles with hybrid guide RNAs in human cells and can induce the formation of double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) at a site complementary to the guide RNA sequence in genomic DNA. This cleavage activity requires both Cas9 and the complementary binding of the guide RNA. Experiments using extracts from transfected cells show that RNA expression and/or assembly into Cas9 is the limiting factor for Cas9-mediated DNA cleavage. In addition, we find that extension of the RNA sequence at the 3' end enhances DNA targeting activity in vivo. These results show that RNA-programmed genome editing is a facile strategy for introducing site-specific genetic changes in human cells.DOI:http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00471.001.

23287722	Bacteria and archaea have evolved adaptive immune defenses, termed clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) systems, that use short RNA to direct degradation of foreign nucleic acids. Here, we engineer the type II bacterial CRISPR system to function with custom guide RNA (gRNA) in human cells. For the endogenous AAVS1 locus, we obtained targeting rates of 10 to 25% in 293T cells, 13 to 8% in K562 cells, and 2 to 4% in induced pluripotent stem cells. We show that this process relies on CRISPR components; is sequence-specific; and, upon simultaneous introduction of multiple gRNAs, can effect multiplex editing of target loci. We also compute a genome-wide resource of ~190 K unique gRNAs targeting ~40.5% of human exons. Our results establish an RNA-guided editing tool for facile, robust, and multiplexable human genome engineering.	P Mali|L Yang|KM Esvelt|J Aach|M Guell|JE DiCarlo|JE Norville|GM Church
23275249	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs), of approximately 10,000 base pairs (bp) in length, were shown to occur in the Japanese Taylorella equigenitalis strain, EQ59. The locus was composed of the putative CRISPRs-associated with 5 (cas5), RAMP csd1, csd2, recB, cas1, a leader region, 13 CRISPR consensus sequence repeats (each 32 bp; 5'-TCAGCCACGTTCGCGTGGCTGTGTGTTTAAAG-3'). These were in turn separated by 12 non repetitive unique spacer regions of similar length. In addition, a leader region, a transposase/IS protein, a leader region, and cas3 were also seen. All seven putative open reading frames carry their ribosome binding sites. Promoter consensus sequences at the -35 and -10 regions and putative intrinsic ρ-independent transcription terminator regions also occurred. A possible long overlap of 170 bp in length occurred between the recB and cas1 loci. Positive reverse transcription PCR signals of cas5, RAMP csd1, csd2-recB/cas1, and cas3 were generated. A putative secondary structure of the CRISPR consensus repeats was constructed. Following this, CRISPR results of the T. equigenitalis EQ59 isolate were subsequently compared with those from the Taylorella asinigenitalis MCE3 isolate.

22772895	Comparative genomics has revealed that variations in bacterial and archaeal genome DNA sequences cannot be explained by only neutral mutations. Virus resistance and plasmid distribution systems have resulted in changes in bacterial and archaeal genome sequences during evolution. The restriction-modification system, a virus resistance system, leads to avoidance of palindromic DNA sequences in genomes. Clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) found in genomes represent yet another virus resistance system. Comparative genomics has shown that bacteria and archaea have failed to gain any DNA with GC content higher than the GC content of their chromosomes. Thus, horizontally transferred DNA regions have lower GC content than the host chromosomal DNA does. Some nucleoid-associated proteins bind DNA regions with low GC content and inhibit the expression of genes contained in those regions. This form of gene repression is another type of virus resistance system. On the other hand, bacteria and archaea have used plasmids to gain additional genes. Virus resistance systems influence plasmid distribution. Interestingly, the restriction-modification system and nucleoid-associated protein genes have been distributed via plasmids. Thus, GC content and genomic signatures do not reflect bacterial and archaeal evolutionary relationships.	H Nishida
